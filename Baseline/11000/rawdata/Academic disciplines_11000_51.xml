      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18057">'''Accidental release source terms''' are the mathematical equations that quantify the flow rate at which accidental releases of liquid or gaseous  [[pollutant]]s into the ambient [[Natural environment|environment]] can occur at industrial facilities such as [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] plants, [[natural gas]] processing plants, oil and gas  transportation [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], chemical plants, and many other industrial activities. Governmental regulations in many countries require that the probability of such accidental releases be analyzed and their quantitative impact upon the environment and human health be determined so that mitigating steps can be planned and implemented. 

There are a number of mathematical calculation methods for determining the flow rate at which gaseous and liquid pollutants might be released from various types of accidents. Such calculational methods are referred to as ''source terms'', and this article on accidental release source terms explains some of the calculation methods used for determining the [[mass flow rate]] at which gaseous pollutants may be accidentally released.

==Accidental release of pressurized gas==
When gas stored under [[pressure]] in a closed vessel is discharged to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] through a hole or other opening, the gas [[velocity]] through that opening may be choked (i.e., it has attained a maximum) or it may be non-choked.

Choked velocity, also referred to as sonic velocity, occurs when the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream pressure is equal to or greater than '''[(''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1)&lt;/sup&gt;''', where ''k'' is the [[heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]] of the discharged gas (sometimes called the [[adiabatic index|isentropic expansion factor]] and sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;).

For many gases, ''k'' ranges from about 1.09 to about 1.41, and therefore '''[(''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1 )&lt;/sup&gt;''' ranges from 1.7 to about 1.9, which means that choked velocity usually occurs when the absolute source vessel pressure is at least 1.7 to 1.9 times as high as the absolute downstream ambient atmospheric pressure.

When the gas velocity is choked, the equation for the [[mass flow rate]] in SI metric units is:&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'', Sixth Edition, McGraw-Hill Co., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazards&gt;''Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures'', Appendix B, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1989.

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\; \sqrt{\;k\;\rho\;P\; \left(\frac{2}{k+ 1}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

or this equivalent form:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;P\;\sqrt{\left(\frac{\;\,k\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\right)\left(\frac{2}{k + 1}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above equations, '''it is important to note that although the gas velocity reaches a maximum and becomes choked, the mass flow rate is not choked'''. The mass flow rate can still be increased if the source pressure is increased.

Whenever the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream ambient pressure is less than 
'''[ (''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1)&lt;/sup&gt;''', then the gas velocity is non-choked (i.e., sub-sonic) and the equation for mass flow rate is:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;\sqrt{\;2\;\rho\;P\;\left[\frac{k}{k - 1}\right]\left[\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{k}-\;\,\left(\frac{\;P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k}\;\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

or this equivalent form:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;P\; \sqrt{\left[\frac{2\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\right]\left[\frac{k}{k - 1}\right]\left[\,\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{k} -\;\,\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k}\;\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equations calculate the '''initial instantaneous''' mass flow rate for the pressure and temperature existing in the source vessel when a release first occurs. The initial instantaneous flow rate from a leak in a pressurized gas system or vessel is much higher than the average flow rate during the overall release period because the pressure and flow rate decrease with time as the system or vessel empties. Calculating the flow rate versus time since the initiation of the leak is much more complicated, but more accurate. Two equivalent methods for performing such calculations are presented and compared at [http://www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html].

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'' which applies to any [[ideal gas]] or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''/''M''.

Notes:
* The above equations are for a real gas.
* For an ideal gas, '''''Z''''' = 1 and '''''ρ''''' is the ideal gas density.
* 1{{nbsp}}kilomole (kmol) = 1000{{nbsp}}[[mole (unit)|moles]] = 1000 gram-moles = kilogram-mole.

===Ramskill's equation for non-choked mass flow===

P.K. Ramskill's equation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.utexas.edu/cache/newsletters/Spr_99.pdf CACHE Newsletter No.48, Spring 1999] Gierer, C. and Hyatt, N.,''Using Source Term Analysis Software for Calculating Fluid Flow Release Rates'' Dyadem International Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramskill, P.K. (1986), ''Discharge Rate Calculation Methods for Use In Plant Safety Assessments'', Safety and Reliability Directory, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority&lt;/ref&gt;  for the non-choked flow of an ideal gas is shown below as equation (1):

: (1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Q = C \;\rho_A\;A\;\sqrt{\frac{\;\,2\;P}{\rho} \cdot \frac{k}{k-1} \cdot \left[\; 1 - {\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k - 1}{k}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

The gas density, '''''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''', in Ramskill's equation is the ideal gas density at the downstream  conditions of temperature and pressure and it is defined in equation (2) using the [[ideal gas law]]: 

: (2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \frac{M\;P_A}{R \;T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the downstream temperature '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is not known, the isentropic expansion equation below &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/compexp.html Isentropic Compression or Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt; is used to determine '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' in terms of the known upstream temperature '''''T''''': 

: (3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_A}{T} = \left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k - 1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining equations (2) and (3) results in equation (4) which defines '''''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' in terms of the known upstream temperature '''''T''''':

: (4) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \frac{M \;P^\frac{k - 1}{k}}{R \;T \;P_A^{-\frac{1}{k}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using equation (4) with Ramskill's equation (1) to determine non-choked mass flow rates for ideal gases gives identical results to the results obtained using the non-choked flow equation presented in the previous section above.

==Evaporation of non-boiling liquid pool==
Three different methods of calculating the rate of evaporation from a non-boiling liquid pool are presented in this section. The results obtained by the three methods are somewhat different.

===The U.S. Air Force method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were derived from field tests performed by the U.S. Air Force with pools of liquid hydrazine. &lt;ref name=Hazards/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = \left(4.161 \times 10^{-5}\right) \cdot u^{0.75} \cdot T_F \cdot M \cdot \frac{P_S}{P_H}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right |where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''E''
| align=left  | = evaporation flux, kg/m²·min of pool surface
|-
! align=right | ''u''
| align=left  | = windspeed just above the liquid surface, m/s
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = absolute ambient temperature, K
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid temperature correction factor, dimensionless
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''
| align=left  | = pool liquid temperature, °C
|-
! align=right | ''M'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless
|-
! align=right | ''P&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid vapor pressure at ambient temperature, [[mmHg]]
|-
! align=right | ''P&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = hydrazine vapor pressure at ambient temperature, mmHg (see equation below)
|}

'''If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = 0{{nbsp}}°C or less, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.0'''

'''If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0{{nbsp}}°C, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.0&amp;nbsp;+ 0.0043 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

: &lt;math&gt;P_H = 760 \cdot e^{65.3319 - \frac{7245.2}{T_A} - 8.22\;\ln\left(T_a\right) + 0.0061557\;T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"

| align=right | &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
| align=left  | = 2.7183, the base of the natural logarithm system
|-
| align=right | &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt;
| align=left  | = natural logarithm
|}

===The U.S. EPA method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were developed by the United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] using units which were a mixture of metric usage and United States usage.&lt;ref name=Risk/&gt; The non-metric units have been converted to metric units for this presentation.

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{0.1288 \cdot A \cdot P \cdot M^{0.667} \cdot u^{0.78}}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

NB, the constant used here is 0.284 from the mixed unit formula/2.205{{nbsp}}lb/kg.  The 82.05 become 1.0 = (ft/m)² × mmHg/kPa.

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right | where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''E''
| align=left  | = evaporation rate, kg/min
|-
! align=right | ''u''
| align=left  | = windspeed just above the pool liquid surface, m/s
|-
! align=right | ''M'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless 
|-
! align=right | ''A''
| align=left  | = surface area of the pool liquid, m²
|-
! align=right | ''P'' 
| align=left  | = vapor pressure of the pool liquid at the pool temperature, kPa
|-
! align=right | ''T'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid absolute temperature, K
|}

The U.S. EPA also defined the pool depth as 0.01{{nbsp}}m (i.e., 1{{nbsp}}cm) so that the surface area of the pool liquid could be calculated as:

:'''''A''''' = (pool volume, in m³)/(0.01)

Notes:
* 1{{nbsp}}kPa = 0.0102{{nbsp}}[[kgf]]/cm² = 0.01{{nbsp}}bar
* mol = [[mole (unit)|mole]]
* atm = atmosphere

===Stiver and Mackay's method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were developed by Warren Stiver and Dennis Mackay of the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Toronto. &lt;ref name=Stiver&gt;Stiver, W. and Mackay, D., ''A Spill Hazard Ranking System For Chemicals'', Environment Canada First Technical Spills Seminar, Toronto, Canada, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{k \cdot P \cdot M}{R \cdot T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"

| align=right|where:
| &amp;nbsp;

|-
! align=right | ''k''

| align=left  | = the universal gas law constant =  8314.5 Pa·m³/(kmol·K)
|-
! align=right | ''u'' 
| align=left  | = windspeed just above the liquid surface, m/s
|}

==Evaporation of boiling cold liquid pool==
The following equation is for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of cold liquid (i.e., at a liquid temperature of about 0{{nbsp}}°C or less).&lt;ref name=Hazards/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = 0.0001\;M (7.7026 - 0.0288\;B)\; e^{-(0.0077\;B) - 0.1376}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right | where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''E''
| align=left  | = evaporation flux, (kg/min)/m² of pool surface
|-
! align=right | ''B''
| align=left  | = pool liquid [[atmospheric boiling point]], °C
|-
! align=right | ''M'' 
| align=left  | = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless
|-
! align=right | ''e''
| align=left  | = the base of the natural logarithm system = 2.7183
|}

==Adiabatic flash of liquefied gas release==
Liquefied gases such as ammonia or chlorine are often stored in cylinders or vessels at ambient temperatures and pressures well above atmospheric pressure. When such a liquefied gas is released into the ambient atmosphere, the resultant reduction of pressure causes some of the liquefied gas to vaporize immediately. This is known as [[flash evaporation|"adiabatic flashing"]] and the following equation, derived from a simple heat balance, is used to predict how much of the liquefied gas is vaporized. 

: &lt;math&gt;X = 100\;\frac{H_s^L - H_a^L}{H_a^V - H_a^L}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right | where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''X''
| align=left  | = weight percent vaporized
|-
! align=right | ''H&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;''
| align=left  | = source liquid [[enthalpy]] at source temperature and pressure, J/kg
|-
! align=right | ''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = flashed vapor enthalpy at atmospheric boiling point and pressure, J/kg
|-
! align=right | ''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;''
| align=left  | = residual liquid enthalpy at atmospheric boiling point and pressure, J/kg
|}

If the enthalpy data required for the above equation is unavailable, then the following equation may be used.

: &lt;math&gt;X = 100 \cdot c_p \cdot \frac{T_s - T_b}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right | where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''X''
| align=left  | = weight percent vaporized
|-
! align=right | ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''
| align=left  | = source liquid [[specific heat]], J/(kg&amp;nbsp;°C)
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''
| align=left  | = source liquid absolute temperature, K
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = source liquid absolute atmospheric boiling point, K
|-
! align=right | ''H''
| align=left  | = source liquid [[heat of vaporization]] at atmospheric boiling point, J/kg
|}

'''Adoptive cell transfer''' (ACT) is the transfer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] into a patient.&lt;ref name="pmid18779745"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tran KQ, Zhou J, Durflinger KH, Langhan MM, Shelton TE, Wunderlich JR, Robbins PF, Rosenberg SA, Dudley ME | title = Minimally cultured tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes display optimal characteristics for adoptive cell therapy | journal = Journal of Immunotherapy | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 742–51 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18779745 | pmc = 2614999 | doi = 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31818403d5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells may have originated from the patient or from another individual. The cells are most commonly derived from the immune system with the goal of improving immune functionality and characteristics. In autologous [[cancer immunotherapy]], [[T cell]]s are extracted from the patient, genetically modified and cultured ''in vitro'' and returned to the same patient. Comparatively, allogeneic therapies involve cells isolated and expanded from a donor separate from the patient receiving the cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21719916"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marcus A, Eshhar Z | title = Allogeneic adoptive cell transfer therapy as a potent universal treatment for cancer | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = 525–6 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21719916 | pmc = 3248176 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[lymphocytes]] were discovered to be the mediators of [[allograft]] rejection in animals. Attempts to use T cells to treat transplanted [[murine]] tumors required cultivating and manipulating T cells in culture. [[Syngeneic]] lymphocytes were transferred from rodents heavily immunized against the tumor to inhibit growth of small established tumors, becoming the first example of ACT.&lt;ref name=rr15/&gt;

Description of T cell growth factor [[interleukin-2]] (IL-2) in 1976 allowed T lymphocytes to be grown ''in vitro'', often without loss of effector functions. High doses of IL-2 could inhibit tumor growth in mice. 1982, studies demonstrated that intravenous immune lymphocytes could treat bulky subcutaneous FBL3 lymphomas. Administration of IL-2 after cell transfer enhanced therapeutic potential.&lt;ref name=rr15/&gt;

In 1985 IL-2 administration produced durable tumor regressions in some patients with [[metastatic melanoma]]. Lymphocytes infiltrating the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] of growing, transplantable tumors provided a concentrated source of [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes]] (TIL) and could stimulate regression of established lung and liver tumors. In 1986, human TILs from resected melanomas were found to contain cells that could recognize autologous tumors. In 1988 autologous TILs were shown to reduce metastatic melanoma tumors.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt; Tumor-derived TILs are generally mixtures of [[CD8]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and [[CD4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;T cells with few major contaminating cells.&lt;ref name=rr15/&gt;

In 1989 [[Zelig Eshhar]] published the first study in which a T cell’s targeting receptor was replaced, and noted that this could be used to direct T cells to attack any kind of cell; this is the essential biotechnology underlying [[Chimeric antigen receptor|CAR-T]] therapy.&lt;ref name="ar15"&gt;{{cite news |title = Biotech’s Coming Cancer Cure|first = Antonio|last = Regalado | name-list-format = vanc |date = June 18, 2015|accessdate = 16 October 2016|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538441/biotechs-coming-cancer-cure|work = Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses were often of short duration and faded days after administration. In 2002, lymphodepletion using a nonmyeloablative [[chemotherapy]] regimen administered immediately before TIL transfer increased cancer regression, as well as the persistent oligoclonal repopulation of the host with the transferred lymphocytes. In some patients, the administered antitumor cells represented up to 80% of the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;T cells months after the infusion.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Initially, melanoma was the only cancer that reproducibly yielded useful TIL cultures. In 2006 administration of normal circulating lymphocytes transduced with a [[retrovirus]] encoding a [[T-cell receptor]] (TCR) that recognized the [[MART-1]] melanoma-melanocyte antigen, mediated tumor regression. In 2010 administration of lymphocytes genetically engineered to express a [[chimeric antigen receptor|chimeric antibody receptor]] (CAR) against B cell antigen [[CD19]] was shown to mediate regression of an advanced [[B cell lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

In 2009, a woman given T cells engineered to recognize [[colon cancer]] went into respiratory distress and died.

By 2010, doctors had begun experimental treatments for leukemia patients using CD19-targeted T cells with added DNA to stimulate cell division. As of 2015 trials had treated about 350 leukemia and lymphoma patients. Antigen CD19 appears only on [[B cells]], which go awry in lymphoma and leukemia. Loss of B cells can be countered with [[immunoglobulin]].&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

Startups including [[Juno Therapeutics]] exploit the combination of aggressive tumors and [[FDA]] willingness to approve potential therapies for such ailments to accelerate approvals for new therapies.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

In checkpoint therapy, antibodies bind to molecules involved in [[T-cell]] regulation to remove inhibitory pathways that block T-cell responses, known as immune checkpoint therapy.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

As of 2015 the technique had expanded to treat [[cervical cancer]], [[lymphoma]], [[leukemia]], [[bile duct cancer]] and [[neuroblastoma]]&lt;ref name="rr15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP | title = Adoptive cell transfer as personalized immunotherapy for human cancer | journal = Science | volume = 348 | issue = 6230 | pages = 62–8 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25838374 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaa4967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 2016, [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[sarcoma]] and [[melanoma]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/dramatic-remissions-in-blood-cancer-in-immunotherapy-treatment-trial|title = Dramatic remissions in blood cancer in immunotherapy treatment trial|date = March 10, 2016|website = www.kurzweilai.net|access-date = 2016-03-13}}{{MEDRS|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, CD19-specific [[chimeric antigen receptor]] (CAR)-modified T cells were used to treat patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ [[B cell]] malignancies, including B cell [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (B-ALL) harboring rearrangement of the [[KMT2A|mixed lineage leukemia]] (MLL) gene with CD19 CAR-T cells.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner R, Wu D, Cherian S, Fang M, Hanafi LA, Finney O, Smithers H, Jensen MC, Riddell SR, Maloney DG, Turtle CJ | title = Acquisition of a CD19-negative myeloid phenotype allows immune escape of MLL-rearranged B-ALL from CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy | journal = Blood | volume = 127 | issue = 20 | pages = 2406–10 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26907630 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2015-08-665547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers developed a technique that used cancer cells' RNA to produce T cells and an immune response. They encased the RNA in a negatively charged fatty membrane. ''In vivo'', this electrical charge guided the particles towards the patient's [[Dendritic cell|dendritic immune cells]] that specify immune system targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kranz LM, Diken M, Haas H, Kreiter S, Loquai C, Reuter KC, Meng M, Fritz D, Vascotto F, Hefesha H, Grunwitz C, Vormehr M, Hüsemann Y, Selmi A, Kuhn AN, Buck J, Derhovanessian E, Rae R, Attig S, Diekmann J, Jabulowsky RA, Heesch S, Hassel J, Langguth P, Grabbe S, Huber C, Türeci Ö, Sahin U | title = Systemic RNA delivery to dendritic cells exploits antiviral defence for cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature | volume = 534 | issue = 7607 | pages = 396–401 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27281205 | doi = 10.1038/nature18300 | laysummary = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cancer-vaccine-immunotherapy-universal-immune-system-rna-nature-journal-a7060181.html | laydate = June 1, 2016 | laysource = The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, researchers announced the first use of donor cells (rather than the patients' own cells) to defeat leukemia in two infants for whom other treatments had failed. The cells had four genetic modifications. Two were made using [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]]. One changed the cells so that they did not attack all the cells of another person. Another modification made tumor cells their target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603502/two-infants-treated-with-universal-immune-cells-have-their-cancer-vanish/ | title=Two infants treated with universal immune cells have their cancer vanish|last=Regalado|first=Antonio | name-list-format = vanc |newspaper=MIT Technology Review|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
In melanoma, a resected melanoma specimen is digested into a single-cell suspension or divided into multiple tumor fragments. The result is individually grown in IL-2. Lymphocytes overgrow. They destroy the tumors in the sample within 2 to 3 weeks. They then produce pure cultures of lymphocytes that can be tested for reactivity against other tumors, in coculture assays. Individual cultures are then expanded in the presence of IL-2 and excess irradiated [[Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody|anti-CD3 antibodies]]. The latter targets the epsilon subunit within the human [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] complex of the TCR. 5–6 weeks after resecting the tumor, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes can be obtained.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Prior to infusion, a lymphodepleting preparative regimen is undergone, typically 60&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[cyclophosphamide]] for 2 days and 25&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[fludarabine]] administered for 5 days. This substantially increases infused cell persistence and the incidence and duration of clinical responses. Then cells and IL-2 at 720,000 IU/kg to tolerance are infused.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

[[Interleukin-21]] may play an important role in enhancing the efficacy of T cell based ''in vitro'' therapies.

In early trials, preparing engineered T cells cost $75,000 to manufacture cells for each patient.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

[[Interleukin-2]] is normally added to the extracted T cells to boost their effectiveness, but in high doses it can have a toxic effect. The reduced number of injected T cells is accompanied by reduced Il-2, thereby reducing side effects. ''In vitro'' tests on melanoma and kidney cancer models met expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monette A, Ceccaldi C, Assaad E, Lerouge S, Lapointe R | title = Chitosan thermogels for local expansion and delivery of tumor-specific T lymphocytes towards enhanced cancer immunotherapies | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 75 | issue =  | pages = 237–249 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26513416 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.021 | laysummary = http://crchum.chumontreal.qc.ca/en/news-briefs/intelligent-gel-attacks-cancer | laydate = November 19, 2015 | laysource = University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 ''[[Strep-tag|Strep]]''[[Strep-tag|-tag II]] sequences were introduced into synthetic CAR or natural T-cell receptors to serve as a marker for identification, rapid purification, tailoring spacer length for optimal function and selective, antibody-coated, microbead-driven, large-scale expansion. This facilitates [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] manufacturing of pure populations of engineered T cells and enables ''in vivo'' tracking and retrieval of transferred cells for downstream research applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu L, Sommermeyer D, Cabanov A, Kosasih P, Hill T, Riddell SR | title = Inclusion of Strep-tag II in design of antigen receptors for T-cell immunotherapy | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 430–4 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26900664 | pmc = 4940167 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic engineering ==
Antitumor receptors genetically engineered into normal T cells can be used for therapy. T cells can be redirected by the integration of genes encoding either conventional alpha-beta TCRs or CARs. CARs ([[chimeric antigen receptor|Chimeric Antibody Receptor]]s) were pioneered in the late 1980s and can be constructed by linking the variable regions of the antibody heavy and light chains to intracellular signaling chains such as CD3-zeta, potentially including costimulatory domains encoding [[CD28]] or [[CD137]]. CARs can provide recognition of cell surface components not restricted to [[major histocompatibility complex]]es (MHC). They can be introduced into T cells with high efficiency using [[viral vectors]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26735408/&gt;

==Correlations between T cell differentiation status, cellular persistence, and treatment outcomes==
Improved antitumor responses have been seen in mouse and monkey models using T cells in early differentiation stages (such as naïve or central memory cells). CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells follow a progressive pathway of differentiation from naïve T cells into stem cell memory, central memory, effector memory, and ultimately terminally differentiated effector T cell populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crompton JG, Narayanan M, Cuddapah S, Roychoudhuri R, Ji Y, Yang W, Patel SJ, Sukumar M, Palmer DC, Peng W, Wang E, Marincola FM, Klebanoff CA, Zhao K, Tsang JS, Gattinoni L, Restifo NP | title = Lineage relationship of CD8(+) T cell subsets is revealed by progressive changes in the epigenetic landscape | journal = Cellular &amp; Molecular Immunology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 25914936 | pmc = 4947817 | doi = 10.1038/cmi.2015.32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells paradoxically lose antitumor power as they acquire the ability to lyse target cells and to produce the [[cytokine]] [[interferon-γ]], qualities otherwise thought to be important for antitumor efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gattinoni L, Lugli E, Ji Y, Pos Z, Paulos CM, Quigley MF, Almeida JR, Gostick E, Yu Z, Carpenito C, Wang E, Douek DC, Price DA, June CH, Marincola FM, Roederer M, Restifo NP | title = A human memory T cell subset with stem cell-like properties | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1290–7 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21926977 | pmc = 3192229 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gattinoni L, Klebanoff CA, Palmer DC, Wrzesinski C, Kerstann K, Yu Z, Finkelstein SE, Theoret MR, Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP | title = Acquisition of full effector function in vitro paradoxically impairs the in vivo antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 115 | issue = 6 | pages = 1616–26 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15931392 | pmc = 1137001 | doi = 10.1172/JCI24480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiation state is inversely related to proliferation and persistence. Age is negatively correlated with clinical effectiveness. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells can exist in a stem cell–like state, capable of clonal proliferation. Human T memory stem cells express a gene program that enables them to proliferate extensively and differentiate into other T cell populations.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells can also promote tumor rejection. CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells enhance CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell function and can directly destroy tumor cells. Evidence suggests that T helper 17 cells can promote sustained antitumor immunity.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muranski P, Borman ZA, Kerkar SP, Klebanoff CA, Ji Y, Sanchez-Perez L, Sukumar M, Reger RN, Yu Z, Kern SJ, Roychoudhuri R, Ferreyra GA, Shen W, Durum SK, Feigenbaum L, Palmer DC, Antony PA, Chan CC, Laurence A, Danner RL, Gattinoni L, Restifo NP | title = Th17 cells are long lived and retain a stem cell-like molecular signature | journal = Immunity | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 972–85 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22177921 | pmc = 3246082 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2011.09.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muranski P, Boni A, Antony PA, Cassard L, Irvine KR, Kaiser A, Paulos CM, Palmer DC, Touloukian CE, Ptak K, Gattinoni L, Wrzesinski C, Hinrichs CS, Kerstann KW, Feigenbaum L, Chan CC, Restifo NP | title = Tumor-specific Th17-polarized cells eradicate large established melanoma | journal = Blood | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–73 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18354038 | pmc = 2442746 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-11-120998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrinsic checkpoint blockade==
Other modes of enhancing immuno-therapy include targeting so-called intrinsic immune checkpoint blockades. Many of these intrinsic regulators include molecules with ubiquitin ligase activity, including [[CBLB (gene)|CBLB]]. More recently, [[CISH]], another molecule with ubiquitin ligase activity, was found to be induced by T cell receptor ligation (TCR) and negatively regulate it by targeting the critical signaling intermediate PLC-gamma-1 for degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer DC, Guittard GC, Franco Z, Crompton JG, Eil RL, Patel SJ, Ji Y, Van Panhuys N, Klebanoff CA, Sukumar M, Clever D, Chichura A, Roychoudhuri R, Varma R, Wang E, Gattinoni L, Marincola FM, Balagopalan L, Samelson LE, Restifo NP | title = Cish actively silences TCR signaling in CD8+ T cells to maintain tumor tolerance | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 212 | issue = 12 | pages = 2095–113 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26527801 | pmc = 4647263 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20150304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deletion of CISH in effector T cells has been shown to dramatically augment TCR signaling and subsequent effector cytokine release, proliferation and survival. The adoptive transfer of tumor-specific effector T cells knocked out or knocked down for CISH resulted in a significant increase in functional avidity and long-term tumor immunity. Surprisingly there was no changes in activity of Cish's purported target, STAT5. Thus Cish represents a new class of T-cell intrinsic immunologic checkpoints with the potential to radically enhance adoptive immunotherapies for cancer.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Context ==
Neither tumor bulk nor metastasis site affect the likelihood of achieving a complete cancer regression. Of 34 complete responders in two trials, one recurred. Only one patient with complete regression received more than one treatment. Prior treatment with targeted therapy using [[Braf inhibitor]] [[vemurafenib]] ([[Zelboraf]]) did not affect the likelihood that melanoma patients would experience an objective response. Prior failed immunotherapies did not reduce the odds of objective response.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Solid tumors ==
Several ongoing clinical trials of adoptive cell therapies are ongoing in solid tumors, but challenges in the development of such therapies for this type of malignancy include the lack of surface antigens that are not found on essential normal tissues,&lt;ref name=pmid26735408&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klebanoff CA, Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP | title = Prospects for gene-engineered T cell immunotherapy for solid cancers | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–36 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26735408 | doi = 10.1038/nm.4015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; difficult-to-penetrate tumor stroma, and factors in the tumor microenvironment that impede the activity of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kakarla S, Gottschalk S | title = CAR T cells for solid tumors: armed and ready to go? | journal = Cancer Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–5 | date = 2014-01-01 | pmid = 24667962 | pmc = 4050065 | doi = 10.1097/PPO.0000000000000032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

=== Toxicity ===
Targeting normal, nonmutated antigenic targets that are expressed on normal tissues, but overexpressed on tumors has led to severe on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Toxicity was encountered in patients who received high-avidity TCRs that recognized either the MART-1 or gp100 melanoma-melanocyte antigens, in mice when targeting melanocyte antigens, in patients with renal cancer using a CAR targeting [[carbonic anhydrase 9]] and in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Toxicities can also result when previously unknown cross-reactivities are seen that target normal self-proteins expressed in vital organs. Cancer-testes antigen MAGE-A3 is not known to be expressed in any normal tissues. However, targeting an HLA-A*0201–restricted peptide in MAGE-A3 caused severe damage to gray matter in the brain, because this TCR also recognized a different but related epitope that is expressed at low levels in the brain. That CARs are potentially toxic to self-antigens was observed after infusion of CAR T cells specific for ERBB2. Two patients died when treated with an HLA-A1–restricted MAGE-A3–specific TCR whose affinity was enhanced by a site-specific mutagenesis.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Cancer-testis antigens are a family of intracellular proteins that are expressed during fetal development, but with little expression in normal adult tissues. More than 100 such molecules are epigenetically up-regulated in from 10 to 80% of cancer types. However, they lack high levels of protein expression. Approximately 10% of common cancers appear to express enough protein to be of interest for antitumor T cells. Low levels of some cancer-testes antigens are expressed in normal tissues, with associated toxicities. The NYESO-1 cancer-testes antigen has been targeted via a human TCR transduced into autologous cells. ORs were seen in 5 of 11 patients with metastatic melanoma and 4 of 6 patients with highly refractory [[synovial cell sarcoma]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

“Suicide switches” let doctors kill engineered T cells in emergencies which threaten patient survival.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

=== Cytokine release syndrome ===
[[Cytokine release syndrome]] is another side effect and can be a function of therapeutic effectiveness. As the tumor is destroyed, it releases large quantities of cell signaling protein molecules. This effect killed at least seven patients.&lt;ref name="ar15" /&gt;

=== B cells ===
Molecules shared among tumors and nonessential normal organs represent potential ACT targets, despite the related toxicity. For example, the CD19 molecule is expressed on more than 90% of B cell malignancies and on non-plasma B cells at all differentiation stages and has been successfully used to treat patients with [[follicular lymphoma]], [[large-cell lymphoma]]s, [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Toxicity against CD19 results in B cell loss in circulation and in bone marrow that can be overcome by periodic [[immunoglobulin]] infusions.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Multiple other B cell antigens are being studied as targets, including [[CD22]], [[CD23]], ROR-1 and the immunoglobulin light-chain [[idiotype]] expressed by the individual cancer. CARs targeting either [[CD33]] or [[CD123]] have been studied as a therapy for patients with [[acute myeloid leukemia]], though the expression of these molecules on normal precursors can lead to prolonged [[myeloablation]]. [[B-cell maturation antigen|BCMA]] is a [[tumor necrosis factor]] receptor family protein expressed on mature B cells and plasma cells and can be targeted on [[multiple myeloma]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10906">The '''American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence''', often referred to as the '''American Board''', was launched with a $5 million federal grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Archibald, George, "Paige backs reform in certification of teachers, Washington Times (March 19, 2003) http://www.udel.edu/educ/whitson/897s05/files/Paige%20backs%20reform%20in%20certification%20of%20teachers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The non-partisan, [[non-profit organization]]'s mission is to certify subject experts, experienced professionals, career changers, and military veterans as teachers and was endorsed by U.S. Education Secretary [[Rod Paige]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Shawn Arévalo McCollough]] serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shawn Arévalo McCollough - President &amp; CEO|url = http://abcte.org/about-us/president/|website = ABCTE {{!}} American Board|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online, [[alternative certification|alternative teaching certification]] program is approved in [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Become a Teacher, Teach, Become Certified to Teach|url = http://abcte.org/teach/|website = ABCTE {{!}} American Board|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was launched in [[Arizona]] as the Arizona Center for Teacher Preparation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;AZ TV7, http://www.aztv.com/story/22526262/arizona-center-for-teacher-preparation-to-address-teacher-shortages {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130710190426/http://www.aztv.com/story/22526262/arizona-center-for-teacher-preparation-to-address-teacher-shortages |date=2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] endorsed the program,&lt;ref name="AZ3"&gt;http://azctp.org/testimonials-2/&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses the shortage of math and science teachers in the state.&lt;ref name="AZ"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/25/ariz-teachers-recruit-idUSnPNDC38485+1e0+PRN20130625&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The American Board is dedicated to preparing, certifying, and supporting individuals who want to improve their communities by becoming a teacher. The training and certification program is designed to inspire career changers to become a teacher and give them a rigorous and efficient process to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
The program is entirely online and self-paced. Candidates have 12 months to complete the program, though the average amount of time it takes most candidates is between 7 and 10 months. A bachelor's degree is required for acceptance into the American Board teaching certification program, and participants must pass a background check. Candidates enrolled in the program study for and take two certification exams- one that covers Professional Teaching Knowledge (PTK) and one that covers subject area knowledge. The program is online,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-what-is-nctq-and-why-you-should-know/2012/05/23/gJQAg7CrlU_blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; giving candidates the flexibility to work towards earning their certification on their own time.

==Acceptance of Certifications==
American Board certification is recognized in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. Many [[charter school|charter]] and [[private school]]s nationwide also recognize the certification. Certification areas are [[Primary education|elementary education]], English, mathematics, general science, biology, physics, chemistry, U.S. history, world history and [[special education]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://abcte.org/teach/&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of certification areas and requirements vary by state.

==History==
The American Board was founded in 2001 with a grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Developed on the foundation that highly trained and skilled professionals should have the opportunity to pursue a career in teaching, the American Board was created with a mission to give enable qualified individuals a flexible and affordable path to teacher certification in their state.

The first state to accept the American Board certification for its public schools was Pennsylvania, when the State Board of Education adopted it in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pateach.org/documents/teacherEdBg.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202113008/http://www.pateach.org/documents/teacherEdBg.htm |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early study of the American Board teacher certification by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found the program to be enrolling and screening increasing numbers of candidates with the average age of nearly 40, suggesting candidates are primarily career changers with more work experience than other entry-level teachers. Most candidates were able to find teaching positions soon after finishing the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/ABCTE.pdf “An Evaluation of American Board Teacher Certification: Progress and Plans”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217141845/http://mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/ABCTE.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }} Mathematica Policy Research (May 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, U.S. Education Secretary [[Rod Paige]] announced the American Board would receive a $35 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] for its continued development of a fast-track route into the teaching profession.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Julie. [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11062254/ed-dept-gives-35-million-teacher-credential-board “Ed. Dept. Gives $35 Million To Teacher-Credential Board”] Education Week (October 1, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idaho State Board of Education approved the American Board program as a route to a full teacher license in November 2003. Idaho Governor [[Dirk Kempthorne]] said should he decide to become a teacher after politics, he would use the American Board program to become a certified teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130713023419/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=030304&amp;ID=s1494819 “Teacher Test Draws Praise and Complaints] The Spokesman Review (March 3, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida State Board of Education approved the American Board program in June 2004. Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] was a supporter,&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Beth. [http://www.minnpost.com/learning-curve/2011/04/jeb-bush-touts-florida-school-reforms-capitols-supportive-gop-skeptical-dfl “Jeb Bush touts Florida school reforms to Capitol's supportive GOP, skeptical DFL”] Minn Post (April 26, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  and President [[George H.W. Bush]] received his teacher certification through an alternative program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://educationviews.org/test-3/ “George Bush Sr. Received an Alternative Teaching Certificate”] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130713023452/http://educationviews.org/test-3/ |date=2013-07-13 }} Education News (July 23, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Utah House Standing Committee introduced HB0110 and, although it did not pass, the American Board program was approved in November 2004 by the Utah State Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/utah-adopts-american-board-certification-helping-state/&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, the New Hampshire Commissioner of Education approved the American Board program.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/teach/new-hampshire/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mississippi Professional Standards Board approved the program in July 2006. Governor [[Haley Barbour]] said, "In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Mississippi faces years of recovery and rebuilding. To ensure that we accomplish our goals, Mississippi communities are working together to improve our schools so that every child in Mississippi has an opportunity to succeed. First and foremost, we must recruit the very best teachers for our students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://neshobademocrat.com/print.asp?ArticleID=13084&amp;SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=297 “Barbour Celebrates Launch of Teacher Certification Program”] The Neshoba Democrat (August 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]] adopted alternative certification as a pathway to teaching and cited the American Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://usmayors.org/workforce/documents/2006RECRUITINGResolution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina House Bill 3476 was signed into law on June 13, 2007, accepting American Board certification. Governor [[Mark Sanford]] said the program would "make a real impact in getting more qualified teachers in our classrooms, and we're pleased to welcome this program to our state."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-option-for-south-carolina-teacher-certification-58092782.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Missouri Governor [[Matt Blunt]] signed Senate Bill 1066 on May 1, 2008 allowing American Board certificate holders to practice there. The Governor said, "Under the old system, Bill Gates couldn’t teach a class in computer software in a Missouri high school. This bill allows experienced professionals to become certified teachers.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showmedaily.org/2008/05/a-victory-for-a.html “A Victory for Certification”] Show Me Daily (May 5, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oklahoma House passed Senate Bill 582 with a unanimous vote of 99 to zero in April 2009, and it was soon signed into law, making Oklahoma the ninth American Board state.

In July 2009, the American Board announced that the organization's initial grant had drawn to a close and it had reached a financial position that will allow the organization to continue to operate without requesting an extension of these government funds.

The Arizona Center for Teacher Preparation was launched in 2013.&lt;ref name="AZ" /&gt; Then Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] endorsed the program,&lt;ref name="AZ3" /&gt; which addresses the shortage of math and science teachers in the state.&lt;ref name="AZ2"&gt;Gonzales, Angela “[http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/06/27/center-for-teacher-preparation.html "Center for teacher preparation offering $1000 scholarships for wannabe teachers"]” Phoenix Business Journal (June 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Aid==
The American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence provides reduced enrollment pricing for those who fall within the parameters of the Federal Reduced Lunch Rate Act, which is based on household size, and combined income.

[[File:Arching action in laterally restrained slab.svg|thumb|Idealisation of arching action forces in laterally restrained slab]]
'''Arching or compressive membrane action (CMA) in reinforced concrete slabs''' occurs as a result of the great difference between the [[tensile]] and [[compressive strength]] of concrete.  Cracking of the concrete causes a migration of the neutral axis which is accompanied by in-plane expansion of the slab at its boundaries.  If this natural tendency to expand is restrained, the development of arching action enhances the strength of the slab. 
The term arching action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in one-way spanning slabs and compressive membrane action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in two-way spanning slabs.

== Background ==
[[File:Arching action in bridge deck slab.png|thumb|Arching action forces in beam and slab bridge deck]]
The strength enhancing effects of arching action in [[reinforced concrete]] floors were first recognised near the beginning of last century.&lt;ref&gt;Westergaard, H.M. and Slater, W.A., ' Moments and stresses in slabs', Proceedings of the American Concrete Institute, 1921, Vol. 17, pp 415–538.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the full scale destructive load tests by Ockleston&lt;ref&gt;Ockleston, A.J., 'Load tests on a three-storey building in Johannesburg', The Structural Engineer, 1955, Vol. 33, October, pp 304–322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ockleston, A.J., 'Arching action in reinforced concrete slabs', The Structural Engineer, 1958, Vol. 36, No.6, pp 197–201.&lt;/ref&gt; on the Old Dental Hospital in [[Johannesburg]] that the extent of strength enhancement caused by arching action was really appreciated.  In these tests, collapse loads of between 3 and 4 times those predicted by yield-line theory&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, K.W., 'Brudlinieteorier', Jul. Gjellerups Forlag, Copenhagen, 1943, 191pp (Yieldline theory', translated by Cement &amp; Concrete Association, London, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; were obtained.
[[File:Arching action strength enhancement.png|thumb|Arching action (CMA) strength enhancement in laterally restrained slab strip]]

== Approaches to treatment of arching action (CMA) ==
Since the 1950s there have been several attempts to develop theories for arching action in both one and two-way slabs.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, R.H., 'Plastic and elastic design of slabs and plates', Thames and Hudson, London, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, K.P., 'The effect of membrane stresses on the ultimate strength of an interior panel in a reinforced concrete slab', The Structural Engineer, 1963, Vol. 41, No. 8, pp 261–265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibenberg, A.C., 'Arch action in concrete slabs', National Building Research Institute Bulletin, 1966, No. 40. CSIR Research Report No. 234, Pretoria, S. Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal approaches to membrane action was that due to Park&lt;ref&gt;Park, R., 'Ultimate strength of rectangular concrete slabs under short-term uniform loading with edges restrained against lateral movement', Proceedings Instn. Civ. Engrs, Vol.28, June 1964, pp. 125–150.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been used as a basis for many studies into arching action in slabs.  Park's approach was based on rigid plastic slab strip theory, and required the assumption of a critical deflection of one half of the slab depth at failure.  Park's approach was later extended by Park and Gamble&lt;ref&gt;Park, R. and Gamble, W.L., 'Reinforced concrete slabs', Wiley Interscience, New York, 1980, pp 562–612.&lt;/ref&gt; in their method for predicting the plastic load-deformation response of laterally restrained slabs.

In 1971, the [[American Concrete Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;American Concrete Institute, 'Cracking, deflection and ultimate load of concrete slab systems', SP-30, Detroit, 1971, 382 pp.
&lt;/ref&gt; produced a special publication which presented the most recent research, to that time, on arching and compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs.

A comprehensive review of the literature and studies of both rigid-plastic and elastic-plastic approaches to arching have been compiled by Braestrup&lt;ref&gt;Braestrup, M.W., 'Dome effect in reinforced concrete slabs: rigid-plastic analysis’, J. Struct. Div., Proc Am. Soc. Civ. Engrs, 1980, Vol 106, No. ST6, pp 1237–1253.&lt;/ref&gt; and Braestrup and Morley.&lt;ref&gt;Braestrup, M.W. and Morley, C.T., ‘Dome effect in reinforced concrete slabs: elastic-plastic analysis’, J. Struct. Div., Proc Am. Soc. Civ. Engrs, 1980, Vol 106, No. ST6, pp 1255–1262.&lt;/ref&gt; Lahlouh and Waldron&lt;ref&gt;Lahlouh, E.H. and Waldron, P., ‘Membrane action in one-way slab strips’, Proc. Instn. Civ. Engrs, Structs &amp; Bldgs, 1992, Vol 94, Nov., pp 419–428.&lt;/ref&gt; were some of the earliest researchers to achieve a degree of success in finite element modelling of the phenomenon.  In 1993, Kuang and Morley&lt;ref&gt;Kuang, J. S. and Morley, C. T., ‘A plasticity model for the punching shear of laterally restrained concrete slabs with compressive membrane action’, International Journal of Science, Vol. 35, No. 5, 1993, pp 371–385.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a plasticity approach which included the effect of compressive membrane action on the punching shear strength of laterally restrained concrete slabs.

== United Kingdom approach to CMA in bridge deck design==
In the United Kingdom, the method developed by Kirkpatrick, Rankin &amp; Long&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Rankin Long"&gt;Kirkpatrick, J., Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E.,  'Strength evaluation of M-beam bridge deck slabs',  The Structural Engineer, Vol. 62B, No 3, Sept 1984, pp 60–68.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984 and substantiated by testing a full-scale bridge in 1986&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, J., Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E.,  'The influence of compressive membrane action on the serviceability of beam and slab bridge decks', The Structural Engineer, Vol. 64B, No 1, March 1986, pp 6–9 and 12.&lt;/ref&gt; first led to the introduction of new rules for the economic design of reinforced concrete beam and slab bridge decks in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, 'Design of M-beam bridge decks', Amendment No. 3 to the Bridge Design Code, Northern Ireland Roads Service Headquarters, March 1986, 11.1–11.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and method were later incorporated, by the United Kingdom [[Highways Agency]], into the UK design manual for roads and bridges, BD 81/02, 'Use of Compressive Membrane Action in Bridge Decks'.&lt;ref name = "BD81/02"&gt;United Kingdom Highways Agency, 'Use of compressive membrane action in bridge decks', Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, Vol. 3, Section 4, Part 20, BD 81/02, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of this CMA methodology normally results in substantial savings in reinforcement in the slab of a beam and slab bridge deck, provided certain limitations and boundary conditions are satisfied.

Kirkpatrick, Rankin &amp; Long's&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Rankin Long" /&gt; approach to the prediction of the enhanced punching strength of bridge deck slabs was based on the punching shear prediction equation derived by Long&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.E., 'A two-phase approach to the prediction of the punching strength of slabs', Journal of the American Concrete Institute, Proceedings, Vol.72, No.2, February 1975, pp 37–45.&lt;/ref&gt; for the shear mode of punching failure, combined with an effective reinforcement ratio, which represented the arching action strength enhancement. The effective reinforcement ratio was determined from the maximum arching moment of resistance in a rigidly restrained concrete slab, which Rankin&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;Rankin, G.I.B.,  'Punching failure and compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs', PhD Thesis, Dept of Civil Engineering, Queen's University of Belfast, 1982, 334 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; had derived for laterally restrained concrete slabs from McDowell, McKee and Sevin's&lt;ref&gt;McDowell. E.L., McKee, K.E. and Sevin. E. 'Arching action theory of masonry walls', Journal of the Structural Division, Proceedings, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1956, 82, No. ST2, 915-1–915-18.&lt;/ref&gt; arching action deformation theory for masonry walls.  The derivation of the maximum arching moment of resistance of laterally restrained concrete bridge deck slabs utilised Rankin's&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt; idealised elastic-plastic stress-strain criterion for concrete, valid for concrete cylinder strengths up to at least 70N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which he had derived on the basis of Hognestad, Hanson and McHenry's&lt;ref&gt;Hognestad, E, Hanson, N.W. and McHenry, D., 'Concrete stress distribution in ultimate strength design', Journal of the American Concrete Institute, Proceedings, Vol.52, No.6, December 1955, pp 455–479.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimate parabolic stress block coefficients for concrete.
The adaptation of Kirkpatrick, Rankin &amp; Long's&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Rankin Long" /&gt; punching strength prediction method for laterally restrained bridge deck slabs, given in BD 81/02,&lt;ref name="BD81/02" /&gt; is summarised as follows:

The concrete equivalent cylinder strength, &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{c}} &lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f_{\text{c}} = \frac{  0.8f_{\text{cu}}  } {\gamma_{\text{m}} }&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 1}}}}

The plastic strain value, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\text{c}} &lt;/math&gt;, of an idealised elastic-plastic concrete is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\text{c}} = { \left( -400+60f_{\text{c}}-0.33f_{\text{c}} ^2\right) x 10^{-6}} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 2}}}}

The non-dimensional parameter, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, for the arching moment of resistance is given by:
  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{  \varepsilon_{\text{c}} L_{\text{r}} ^2 } {h^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 3}}}}

In order to treat the slab as restrained, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; must be less than 0.26.  If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 0.26, the deck slab shall be treated as if it were unrestrained.

The non-dimensional arching moment coefficient, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;k = { 0.0525\left( 4.3-16.1\sqrt{3.3 x 10^{-4} +0.1243R}\right) } &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 4}}}}

The effective reinforcement ratio, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\text{e}} = k\left [ \frac{f_{\text{c}}  }{240} \right ] \left [ \frac{h}{d} \right ]^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 5}}}}

The predicted ultimate punching load for a single wheel, &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{ps}}&lt;/math&gt; (N), is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{ps}}  = { 1.52\left( \phi+d\right)d\sqrt{f_{\text{c}} }\left(100\rho_{\text{e}} \right)^{0.25} } &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Equation 6}}}}

where:

* &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = average effective depth to tensile reinforcement (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{cu}}&lt;/math&gt; = characteristic concrete cube strength (N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; = overall slab depth (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;L_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt; = half span of slab strip with boundary restraint (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; = diameter of loaded area (mm)
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\text{m}} &lt;/math&gt; = partial safety factor for strength

Further details on the derivation of the method and how to deal with situations of less than rigid lateral restraint are given by Rankin&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt; and Rankin &amp; Long.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, G.I.B. and Long, A.E. (1997), ‘Arching action strength enhancement in laterally restrained slab strips’, Proc. Instn. Civ. Engrs Structs &amp; Bldgs, 122, Nov., pp 461–467.&lt;/ref&gt; Long and Rankin&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.E. and Rankin, G.I.B., ‘Real strength and robustness of reinforced concrete structures’, Proceedings of conference on Conservation of Engineering Structures, Institution of Civil Engineers/Royal Institute of British Architects, 1989, pp 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the concepts of arching or compressive membrane action in beam and slab bridge decks are also applicable to flat slab and cellular reinforced concrete structures where considerable strength enhancements over design code predictions can also be achieved.

Research into arching or compressive membrane action has continued over the years at [[Queen’s University Belfast]], with the work of Niblock,&lt;ref&gt;Niblock, R., 'Compressive membrane action and the ultimate capacity of uniformly loaded reinforced concrete slabs, PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, G.I.B., Niblock, R.A., Skates, A.S. and Long, A.E.,  'Compressive membrane action strength enhancement in uniformly loaded, laterally restrained slabs', The Structural Engineer, Vol 69, No. 16, 20 August 1991, pp 287–295.&lt;/ref&gt; who investigated the effects of CMA in uniformly loaded laterally restrained slabs; Skates,&lt;ref&gt;Skates, A.S., Development of a design method for restrained concrete slab systems subject to concentrated and uniform loading, PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA in cellular concrete structures; Ruddle,&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle, M.E., 'Arching action and the ultimate capacity of reinforced concrete beams', PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, February 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle M.E., Rankin G.I.B. and Long A.E., 'Arching action–flexural and shear strength enhancements in rectangular and Tee beams', Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Structures and Buildings Journal, 156, Issue 1, February 2003, pp 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched arching action in laterally restrained rectangular and [[T-beam|Tee-beams]]; Peel-Cross,&lt;ref&gt;Peel-Cross, R.J., Rankin, G.I.B., Gilbert, S.G. and Long, A.E., ' Compressive membrane action in composite floor slabs in the Cardington LBTF', Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Structures and Buildings Journal, 146, Issue 2, May 2001, pp 217–226.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA in composite floor slab construction; Taylor&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., 'Compressive membrane action in high strength concrete bridge deck slabs', PhD thesis, The Queen's University of Belfast, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., Rankin, G.I.B. and Cleland, D.J., (2001) 'Arching action in high strength concrete slabs', Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Structures and Buildings, Vol.146, Issue 4, Nov.2001 pp 353–362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., Rankin, B., Cleland, D.J, and Kirkpatrick, J., 'Serviceability of bridge deck slabs with arching action', American Concrete Institute Structural Journal, Vol. 104, No.1 January–February 2007, pp 39–48.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA in high strength concrete bridge deck slabs, and Shaat&lt;ref&gt;Shaat, A.J.S., 'The real strength of laterally restrained reinforced concrete slabs, PhD thesis, Queen's University of Belfast, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; who researched CMA using [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) techniques. A comprehensive guide to compressive membrane action in concrete bridge decks, was compiled by Taylor, Rankin and Cleland in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., Rankin, G.I.B. and Cleland, D.J., 'Guide to compressive membrane action in concrete bridge decks', Technical Paper 3, Concrete Bridge Development Group, Camberley, Surrey, 2002, 46 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American approach to CMA in bridge-deck design==
In North America, a more pragmatic approach has been adopted and research into compressive membrane action has primarily stemmed from the work of Hewitt and Batchelor&lt;ref name ="Hewitt and Batchelor"&gt;Hewitt , B.E. and Batchelor, B. de V., 'Punching shear strength of restrained slabs', J. Struct. Div., Proc. ASCE, Vol. 101, No. ST9, September 1975, pp 1837–1853.&lt;/ref&gt; and Batchelor and Tissington&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, B. de V. and Tissington, I.R., 'Shear strength of two-way bridge slabs', J. Struct. Div., Proc. ASCE, Vol. 102, No. ST12, December 1976, pp 2315–2331.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s.  They carried out an extensive series of field tests, which led to the introduction of an empirical method of design into the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Communication, 'The Ontario highway bridge design code', 1979, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; This required minimum isotropic reinforcement (0.3%) in bridge deck slabs, provided certain boundary conditions were satisfied.  In the 1990s Mufti et al.&lt;ref&gt;Mufti, A. A., Jaeger, L. G., Bakht, B. and Wegner, L.D., 'Experimental investigation of fibre reinforced concrete deck slabs without internal steel reinforcement,' Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 1993, Vol. 20, No.3, pp 398–406.&lt;/ref&gt; extended this research and showed that significant enhancements in the durability of laterally restrained slabs can be achieved by utilising fibre reinforced deck slabs without steel reinforcement.  Later, Mufti and Newhook&lt;ref&gt;Mufti, A. A. and Newhook, J.P., 'Punching shear strength of restrained bridge deck slabs', ACI Structures Journal, 1998, 8(3), pp 375–381.&lt;/ref&gt; adapted Hewitt and Batchelor's&lt;ref name="Hewitt and Batchelor" /&gt; model to develop a method for evaluating the ultimate capacity of fibre reinforced deck slabs using external steel straps for the provision of lateral restraint.

== Transformation ==
In electrical and electronic engineering, transformation from time domain to another domain such as frequency domain is used to focus more on details of the waveform. Many of the details can be analyzed much easier when this transformation is done to waveform, when it goes to another domain. Different methods are present to do transformation from time domain to frequency domain; one of them is the '''Blackman–Tukey transformation''' method that also uses [[Fast Fourier transform]]. To meet the filter specification according to requirements, several methods are used, including windowing effect.

==Statistical estimation==
Statically estimation is to determine the expected value(s) of statistical expected values of statistical quantities. Statistical estimation also tries to find the [[expected values]]. The expected values are those values that we expect among the random values, derived from samples of population in probability (group of subset). Because we have problem here, and in time series analysis, discrete data obtained as a function of time is usually available rather than samples of population or group of subsets taken simultaneously. The difficulty is commonly avoided by the process which is named [[ergodic]] process, that changes with time and probability gets involved with it, and it's not always [[Frequencies|periodic]] at all portions of time.

== Blackman–Tukey transformation methods ==
This method has some procedures such as:
# Calculation of the [[autocorrelation]] function of the data
# Applying a suitable [[window function]], and finally
# Computing a FFT of the data for obtaining the power density spectrum.

Autocorrelation function makes the wave smoothed rather than the averaging several waveforms. This function is set to window, the corresponding waveform toward its extremes.
Computation gets faster if more data is correlated and if memory capacity of the system increases then overlap save sectioning technique would be applied. If the autocorrelation function in Blackman–Tukey is computed using FFT then it will name fast correlation method for spectral estimation.

==History==
The British Society for Developmental Biology was founded in 1948 as the London Embryologists’
Club. In 1964 it was expanded from a club into a scientific society named the Society for Developmental Biology. However in 1964 the [[Society for Developmental Biology|Society for the Study of Growth and Development]] in the United States had also voted to change to the same name, and in 1966 took over sponsorship of the journal [[Developmental Biology]]. In 1969 the smaller British society changed to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slack |first=Jonathan M. W. |title=A short history of the British Society for Developmental Biology |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/10761851 |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |year=2003 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=79-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
{{further|Waddington Medal}}

The society administers four annual awards and a studentship. The [[Waddington Medal]], dating from 1998, is awarded tor "an outstanding individual who has made major contributions to any aspect of Developmental Biology in the UK".&lt;ref name=Awards&gt;{{cite web |title=Awards |url=http://bsdb.org/category/awards/ |publisher=British Society for Developmental Biology |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the society added the Cheryll Tickle Medal to be awarded to a mid-career female scientist. It is named for the embryologist [[Cheryll Tickle]], the first winner of the Waddington Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cheryll Tickle Medal |url=http://bsdb.org/awards/the-cheryll-tickle-medal/ |publisher=British Society for Developmental Biology |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 2016 Abigail Saffron Tucker 
* 2017 Jenny Nichols

The society also has awards for early career scientists. The Beddington Medal is awarded for the "best PhD thesis in developmental biology", the Dennis Summerhill Lecture Award for a junior researcher, and summer studentships for undergraduate studentships.&lt;ref name=Awards /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5037">{{short description|Theorized range of orbits around a star on which brown dwarfs cannot exist as a companion object}}
The '''brown-dwarf desert''' is a theorized range of orbits around a star on which [[brown dwarf]]s cannot exist as a companion object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Planet Formation: Theory, Observations, and Experiments | author = Hubert Klahr and Wolfgang Brandner | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-521-86015-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CukAzsJHQaQC&amp;pg=RA5-PA241&amp;dq=brown-dwarf-desert&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=d5a9R_-kBYmoiQHU9sXnCA&amp;sig=w0aaVbMkwbPZ_28dUfKmOrt2nyQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually up to 5 [[astronomical unit|AU]] around [[solar mass]] stars. The paucity of brown dwarfs in close orbits was first noted between 1998–2000 when a sufficient number of [[extrasolar planets]] had been found to perform statistical studies. [[Astronomers]] discovered there is a distinct shortage of brown dwarfs within 5&amp;nbsp;AU of the [[Binary star|stars with companions]], while there was an abundance of free-floating brown dwarfs being discovered.&lt;ref name=pasp112_768_2000/&gt; Subsequent studies have shown that brown dwarfs [[orbit]]ing within 3–5&amp;nbsp;AU are found around less than 1% of stars with a mass similar to the Sun ({{Solar mass|link=y}}).&lt;ref name=apj679_1_762/&gt;

One of the many possible reasons for the existence of the desert relates to [[Planetary migration|planetary (and brown dwarf) migration]]. If a brown dwarf were to form within 5 AU of its companion star, it could plausibly begin migrating inwards towards the central star and eventually fall into the star itself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} That being said, the exact details of migration within a [[proto-planetary disk]] are not completely understood, and it is equally plausible that brown dwarf companions to FGK dwarfs would not undergo appreciable migration after their formation. A second possible reason is, depending on which formation paradigm is invoked, that a formation by [[Nebular hypothesis|core accretion]] should make the formation of higher mass brown dwarfs unlikely, as the gas accretion rate during runaway accretion onto high mass forming objects is reduced due to gap formation in the disk. The limited disk life time then truncates the mass range, limiting the maximum masses to approximately 10 Jupiter masses ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubow|first1=S. H.|last2=Seibert|first2=M.|last3=Artymowicz|first3=P.|title=Disk Accretion onto High‐Mass Planets|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1999|volume=526|issue=2|pages=1001–1012|doi=10.1086/308045|arxiv = astro-ph/9910404 |bibcode = 1999ApJ...526.1001L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This effect might be somewhat mitigated by the fact that objects of {{Jupiter mass|3–5}} and above might excite eccentric perturbations in the disk, allowing for non-negligible mass accretion even in the presence of a gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kley|first1=W.|last2=Dirksen|first2=G.|title=Disk eccentricity and embedded planets|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=447|issue=1|pages=369–377|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053914|arxiv = astro-ph/0510393 |bibcode = 2006A&amp;A...447..369K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Objects that form further outside (a&gt;80 AU), where the disk is prone to gravitational instabilities, might be able to reach the masses required to cross the planet–brown dwarf threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=authors|first1=edited by S. Seager ; with the assistance of Renée Dotson ; with 34 collaborating|title=Exoplanets|date=2010|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|location=Tucson|isbn=978-0-8165-2945-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these objects it might be unlikely to migrate into the inner regions of the disk, however, due to the long type-II migration timescale for massive objects in the brown dwarf mass regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Udry|first1=Stéphane|last2=Santos|first2=Nuno C.|title=Statistical Properties of Exoplanets|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=397–439|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.45.051806.110529|bibcode = 2007ARA&amp;A..45..397U |arxiv=astro-ph/0306049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calligraffiti''' is an art form that combines [[calligraphy]], [[typography]], and [[graffiti]]. It can be classified as either [[abstract expressionism]] or abstract vandalism. It is defined as a visual art that integrates letters into compositions that attempt to communicate a broader message through writing that has been aesthetically altered to move beyond the literal meaning. Simply put, it is the conscious effort of making a word or group of words into a visual composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcritical.com/2013/09/16/calligraffiti-at-leila-heller/|title=Calligraphy, Meet Graffiti: Calligraffiti at Leila Heller Gallery - artcritical|date=16 September 2013|website=Artcriticial.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is meant to be both an aesthetic experience and provocative art—mixing tradition and precision with modern unbridled self-expression.

==Definition and brief history==

[[File:Calligrafiti-assilah-morocco-2013.jpg|thumb|Wall mural, composed of Arabic letters, in a public street, Assilah, Morocco, 2013]]

The origins of the term, "calligraffiti" are unclear. The Dutch artist [[Niels Shoe Meulman]] is often incorrectly credited with coining the term in 2007, when he used it as the title of his solo exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, Sinno, N., ''War of Colors: Beirut Street Art and the Reclamation of Public Space,'' ''ASAP/Journal,'' Vol. 2, No. 1, 2017, pp. 71-104 as an example of an art historian who credits Muelman, with coining the term and locates it as a form of street art.&lt;/ref&gt; Muelman describes calligraffiti as "traditional handwriting with a metropolitan attitude" and a "way of translating the art of the street to the interior of museums, galleries and apartments." In an interview he explains the technique itself as "directness in the whole, finesse in the details. An even balance between seeing and reading word and image. … letters, writing and language itself becomes an image or abstraction. On the other hand, basic shapes and splats become language."'&lt;ref&gt;Meulman, N. S., ''Calligraffiti: The Graphic Art of Niels Shoe Meulman,'' Urheberrechtlich geschutztes Material, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   

Use of the term, however, predates the contributions of Niels Shoe Meulman by at least thirty years. The Canadian painter, [[Brion Gysin]] used the term in his final exhibition, ''Calligraffiti of Fire'' held at the Galerie Samy Kinge in Paris between 19 April and 19 May in 1986 and the term was also used as the title of the book which accompanied Gysin's exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hoptman, L.J. (ed.), ''Brion Gysin: Dream Machine,'' Merrell, 2010, p. 131; Ballantyne, E., Dvořák, M. and Irvine, D. (eds). ''Translocated Modernisms: Paris and Other Lost Generations,'' University of Ottawa Press, 2016 [e-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used in a book about post-modernism, ''Spirits Hovering Over the Ashes: Legacies of Postmodern Theory'' by [[H.L. Hix]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Hix, H.L., ''Spirits Hovering over the Ashes: Legacies of Postmodern Theory,'' State University of New York Press 1995, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordanian artist and art historian [[Wijdan Ali]] also used the term, "calligraffiti" in her book, ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' (1997) to describe a style of art that had been flourishing across the Middle East and North Africa from the mid-20th century. She defined calligraffiti as the use of  "script of ordinary writing where the work is composed of the artist's personalised handwriting within a modern composition." &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67 and also cited in Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Ali wanted to use the term because she saw this type of art as being inspired by calligraphy yet, also close to the scribbling of graffiti artists. Pioneer artists in this style include: [[Hassan Massoudy]], [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] and [[Parviz Tanavoli]]. &lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Ali locates calligraffiti art as a distinct style within the School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the [[Hurufiyya movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-172&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calligraffiti is distinguished from other styles of calligraphic art (such as ''Pure Calligraphy, Neoclassical, Modern Classical, Freeform, Abstract calligraphy, Calligraphic Combinations and Unconscious Calligraphy)'' in that it has no rules and artists require no formal training.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas, traditional calligraphy in the Islamic world is bound by very strict rules, not the least a prohibition on using representations of the human form in manuscripts, calligraffiti artists break free from such rules and allow themselves to reshape and deconstruct letters as well as to combine them with other symbols and figures in creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti artists are not confined to the use of actual letters. Instead, they go beyond a simple transformation of Arabic or English-language words into visual compositions, and invent new languages. &lt;ref&gt;Carrier, D., "Calligraphy, Meet Graffiti: Calligraffiti at Leila Heller Gallery," ''Artcritical,'' [Online art magazine], 16 December, 2013 [http://www.artcritical.com/2013/09/16/calligraffiti-at-leila-heller/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ali also makes a distinction between ''calligraffiti'' and ''pseudo-calligraffiti.''  Straight calligraffiti refers to the use of calligraphy without the rules of proportion while pseudo-calligraffiti is a total abstraction in which the letters may or may not be legible. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., "The Status of Islamic Art in the Twentieth Century," ''Muqarnas,'' vol. 9, 1992, pp 186-188 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523143 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of calligraffiti appears to have begun in the Middle East and North Africa in around the 1950s, when local artists, searching for a visual language that expressed their national identity and heritage, began incorporating Arabic letters, as a graphic form, into their artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611074834/https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/# |date=2018-06-11 }}, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists such as the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] (b. 1925); the Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi painter-sculptor and philosopher, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] (b.1925) all searched for ways to use Arabic letters in abstract compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 167-169; it should be noted that not all art historians classify Shakir Hassan Al-Said in the list of calligraffiti artists. Nadia Shabout, for example, argues that he does not fit the definition of a calligraffiti artist because he aimed for a total deconstruction of the letter. Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of calligraffiti gathered momentum during the early 21st-century when Middle Eastern street artists co-opted urban spaces for calligraffiti art designed to convey political or provocative statements. This street art practice was especially conspicuous during the wave of uprisings between 2010 and 2013, that became known as the ''Arab Spring'' thereby bringing the art form to the attention of international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Naguib, S.A., "Engaged Ephemeral Art: Street Art and the Egyptian Arab Spring," ''Transcultural Studies,'' Vol. 2, 2016, pp 53-86&lt;/ref&gt; Certain calligraffiti artists have credited the Middle Eastern calligraphy artists as an important influence on their work. For instance, the Tunisian calligraffiti artist, [[el Seed]] points to the work of Iraqi painter, [[Hassan Massoudy]] as a major source of inspiration, noting that "The work of Hassan Massoudy was totally out of anything I’ve seen from the way he shapes the letters to the colors he uses. He completely revolutionized the art of calligraphy.” &lt;ref&gt;Saldaña, S., "Reviving Arabic Calligraphy: An Encounter with Iraqi-French artist Hassan Massoudy," ''Mosaic Stories,'' 10 March, 2017, [http://www.mosaicstories.org/2017/03/10/reviving-arabic-calligraphy-encounter-iraqi-french-artist-hassan-massoudy/ Online:}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Characteristics===
Calligraffiti is a complex process. Its specificity is in its paradoxical nature, as it is characterised by and composed of many elements that appear contradictory: 
* blending of tradition and modernity
* sharing of culture and political subversion
* beauty and provocation 
* precision and spontaneity 
* philosophical and reactionary
* literal and metaphorical
It requires an overall vision from the artist- from the message he is trying to convey, to the shape of the letters, to the larger picture he is creating. Calligraffiti artist, Tubs, explains that the art form’s graffiti component forces the artist to reflect upon and consciously create a piece that will arouse a specific feeling or reaction in the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.threadless.com/art-to-the-letter-meet-artist-tubs/|title=Art To The Letter: Meet Artist Tubs - Threadless Blog|date=17 February 2015|website=Blog.threadless.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the alphabet as an artistic medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artistsofutah.org/15bytes/11oct/page6.html|title=Jerry Hardesty - Toni Youngblood|first=Artists of|last=Utah|website=artistsofutah.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; demands practice, accuracy, and foresight.

===Tools===
Part of what differentiates calligraffiti from calligraphy is its freedom from rules. Calligraphy is a meticulous and specific art that takes years to master. Most calligraffiti artists, like El Seed, do not consider themselves calligraphers because they do not know, nor do they follow the many rules of calligraphy.&lt;ref name="qatartodayonline.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qatartodayonline.com/i-am-not-a-revolutionary-artist/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509101803/http://www.qatartodayonline.com/i-am-not-a-revolutionary-artist/# |archive-date=2016-05-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti on the other hand is characterized by its diversity of mediums, methods, and instruments. Each individual artist uses and sometimes designs his or her own tools.

==Calligraffiti in the Middle East and North Africa==
Arabic calligraphy is incredibly rich; it is an art form that has been perfected for well over a millennium. Islamic tradition greatly encouraged the development of calligraphy as an art form in order to assist religion began to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/02/arabic-calligraphy/|title=Arabic Calligraphy – eL Seed's Writing Is On the Wall|website=Greenprophet.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic writing represents the word of God revealed to Mohammed, which gives Arabic letters a special meaning. &lt;ref&gt; Bloom J. and Blair, S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, Vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread and evolution of calligraphy can be traced very specifically throughout Islamic history as it is inherently tied to the spread of Islam itself. Calligraphy was how scribes transcribed and created Qur'ans—allowing Mohammad's message to extend beyond the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakariya.net/history/index.html|title=Arabic Calligraphy History - Tools, Techniques, Ahar Paper|website=Zakariya.net|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy has always had a central role in Middle Eastern art because of Islamic restrictions concerning the portrayal of human beings. As a result, calligraphy became not only a mechanism for the expansion of Islam, but a way to create religious art.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajammc.com/2013/09/17/word-as-image-contextualizing-calligraffiti-1984-2013-with-french-tunisian-street-artist-el-seed/|title=Word As Image: Contextualizing "Calligraffiti: 1984-2013" with French-Tunisian Street Artist eL Seed - Ajam Media Collective|date=17 September 2013|website=Ajammc.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calligraffiti: calligraphy of the 21st century===
Calligraffiti has emerged quite forcefully in the Middle East in recent years, particularly in the wake of the Arab uprisings. While graffiti has never been widespread in the region, it has spread with the rising dissidence against Middle Eastern dictatorships and authoritarian regimes. Calligraphy artist [[Hassan Massoudy]] called Arabic calligraphy and graffiti "two daughters of the same parents" because of their interrelationship. He notes thtat "Obviously [calligraphy and graffiti] both are about the use of letter and their alphabets, and their center of gravity is the beauty of writing. For both, a letter is more than just a letter and they fill them with emotions. The use of empty space and composition within this space is something else they have in common.&lt;ref&gt;Massoudy, H., "Two Daughers of the Same Parents," in: Don Stone Karl and Pascal Zoghbi, ''Arabic Calligraphy,'' From Here to Fame Publishing, 2011, pp 31-35&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti is a logical evolution of the two art forms coexisting in the same space.

The first step towards calligraffiti was the emergence of the abstract movement in the Middle East during the 20th century. Calligraphy was impacted by the abstract movement in the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of the [[Hurufiyya movement]] in the Arab world and the Saqqa Khaneh movement in Iran. [[Hassan Massoudy]], [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] and [[Parviz Tanavoli]] were some of the pioneers of this new era of calligraphy. The next two decades saw an initial explosion of graffiti in the context of the first Intifada and the Lebanese Civil War.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"/&gt; Today, much calligraffiti is influenced by early Islamic script styles like siah [[mashq]] and [[Kufic]]. Artist and activist, Janet Kozak, characterizes calligraffiti artists in the Middle East as being "not bound by the shackles of tradition, yet still indebted to it" who use "a unique blend of traditional scripts and design mixed with modern materials and techniques".

==Beyond the aesthetic==
Calligraffiti has been a way for artists in the Middle East to reclaim the region while still staying grounded in their culture and tradition. From the civil war in Beirut, to the Palestinian intifadas, to the Arab uprisings, calligraffiti has become a mechanism for social and political protest—where letters become symbols.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printingmuseum.org/eventdetail.php?id=162|title=The Exhibitions at the Museum of Printing History|website=Printingmuseum.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most salient characteristics of the Arab Spring has been the reappropriation of the public sphere and calligraffiti does just that. Calligraffiti is an urban art as much as it is a gallery art, and as such it has served as a tool to reclaim public spaces and impose the will and opinion of the people. Once an infrequent sight, graffiti and calligraffiti now adorn the walls of most major cities in the Middle East, representing the rising political and social tensions in the region. Despite most artists' claims that they are neither political or social actors, their art has inevitable impact—as Saudi artist Rana Jarbou said "words are weapons".

===Political uses===
Many calligraffiti artists contest the idea that their art is political. Askar insists his calligraffiti pieces in Palestine do not make him a political activist, he says "I protest in colors, my activism consists of bringing art to the streets and allowing the public to express themselves"; similarly, El Seed has said "I don’t have any political agenda. I don’t believe in politics".&lt;ref name="qatartodayonline.com"/&gt; But by nature, calligraffiti is meant to express a message, and so it has unavoidable social and political consequences.

Protesting political affairs has been the subject of much of the graffiti in the region, and calligraffiti has not escaped this. Much of the anonymous calligraffiti that emerged from the Arab Spring is deeply embedded in a political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muftah.org/telling-story-arab-spring-interactive-graffiti-map/#.VuwuBJMrLVo|title=Telling the Story of the Arab Spring: an Interactive Graffiti Map|website=muftah.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed’s 2011 mural in Kairouan Tunisia, a poem by Abu al-Qasim al-Husayafi about tyranny and injustice, cannot be separated from the political context it was created in. Similarly, Askar’s piece entitled "Palestine" cannot be separated from the political weight the word "Palestine" holds; nor can his piece that says "salaam" (meaning peace), that is shaped like a key, escape the symbolism of the key in the Palestinian occupation. Anonymous calligraffiti on the Israeli wall in Bethlehem is inherently political because of its location.

The exhibit "Contemporary Arabic Graffiti and Lettering" explores how Calligraffiti creates a dialogue between the social and political sphere, by questioning dominant beliefs and ideologies. It does this by imposing itself on the religious and political debates by commandeering public spaces.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt; Khadiga El Ghawas is one calligraffiti artist that does not shy away from the political messages of her art. She says "My compositions touch upon issues that we currently face in Egypt whether that’s related to politics, religion or society". Her work very explicitly deals with the political realities of Egypt, whether it is political Islam, democracy, or women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social uses===
Calligraffiti, as art, has the power to influence society and the people who are exposed to it. For example, it can be used to bring awareness to lost memories or forgotten moments in history. Inkman's USINA project decorates the forgotten limestone factory walls in Boukornine Tunisia to remind the world of those who struggled there and pay them respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isupportstreetart.com/usina-story-of-brave-men/|title="USINA" Story of brave men - I Support Street Art|date=22 January 2015|website=Isupportstreetart.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed's Lost Walls project attempts to redirect the world and Tunisia's attention to the beauty of the country. His purpose was to create hope in Tunisia; that the people of the country could rediscover something positive and be proud of their culture in the midst of political turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alartemag.be/en/en-culture/el-seeds-graffiti-road-trip-through-tunisia/|title=eL Seed's graffiti road trip through Tunisia - al.arte.magazine|date=11 June 2014|website=Alartmag.be|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese artist Yazan Halwani says his art is means to "write the stories of the city, on its own walls—creating a memory for the city". The civil war created a deep fragmentation within the Lebanese society and a sense of amnesia that Halwani sought to fight against. His calligraffiti is meant to portray the city in a positive light, repair social ties and breathe life into a broken society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/22/beirut-graffiti-artist-yazan-halwani-lebanese|title=How a Beirut graffiti artist is using his murals to try to unite a fragmented city|first=Ellie Violet|last=Bramley|date=22 September 2015|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GhalamDAR, an Iranian artist, tries to reconnect Iranians to their country and culture. He often questions contemporary identity, philosophy, and history in Iran, which can be seen in his piece on the Iranian diaspora that features a headless deer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/focus-points/muslimlifestyle/ghalamdar-persian-calligraffiti-sensation/101500/|title=GhalamDAR: Persian calligraffiti sensation|website=Aquila-style.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti has been a way for all of these artists to try and better the communities they live in.

Another way in which calligraffiti has impacted the social sphere is by engaging a discuss about contemporary issues and bringing people together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theculturetrip.com/africa/tunisia/articles/tunisia-s-first-calligraffiti-artist-el-seed-politics-power-and-paint/|title=Tunisia's Pioneering 'Calligraffiti' Artist eL Seed|first=Isabella|last=Bengoechea|website=Theculturestrip.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed's calligraffiti on the Gabes mosque is a quotation from the Qur'an meant to address intolerance, specifically in regards to religion, art, and the growing Islamist movement in the world. The quote reads "Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female and made people and tribes so you may know each other"; it attempts to break stereotypes and opens a discussion around the place of art in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/arab-graffiti-vandalism-art-spring|title=Arab graffiti: vandalism or art? - Mohamed El Hebeishy|first=Mohamed El|last=Hebeishy|date=9 September 2012|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing his project "Perception" in Cairo, El Seed explained that he is "questioning the level of judgment and misconception society can unconsciously have upon a community based on their differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/calligraffiti-master-astonishes-with-remake-of-marginalized-cairo-neighborhood_39640|title="Calligraffiti" master astonishes with remake of marginalized Cairo neighborhood|website=Yourmiddleeast.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed has referred to himself as an "artivist", or an artist and an activist at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/where-art-blends-with-activism/|title=Where art blends with activism|date=5 April 2012|website=News.harvard.edu=|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calligraffiti: between Middle East and West==
Many calligrafitti artists use Arabic script or are heavily inspired by it. There has been a rise in Arabic calligraffiti outside the Middle East and by non Middle Eastern artists. Arabic calligraffiti has become a cosmopolitan art form. This can partially be attributed to the richness of Arabic calligraphy compared to other scripts. The use of Arabic calligraphy has been a typographic decision by many artists who seek to reinvent the aesthetic.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"/&gt;

===A search for identity===
The widespread use of Arabic calligraphy outside the Middle East is often a result of political and social dynamics.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt; Colonization and immigration has led to an identity crisis in many people, one the artist El Seed often talks about. He says his style developed from his struggle to fit in; the feeling that while he was not French, he was not fully Tunisian either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoya.com/artist-explains-calligraffiti/|title=Artist Explains 'Calligraffiti'|date=27 September 2013|website=Thehoya.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of colonization has created hybrid identities, especially in Europe, but has also allowed other cultures to be exposed to Middle Eastern cultures. As a result, artists like Julien Breton and L'atlas have adopted the Arabic script style. Artists like Aerosol Arabic or Haji Noor Deen turned to Arabic calligraffiti after they converted to Islam. Many artists use calligraffiti to reconnect with cultural and historical identities that they lost, or as a way to find a new identity.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt;

==Artists==
Calligraffiti is a relatively new term and graffiti is still taboo in  parts of the Middle East and Asia, and as a result many calligraffiti artists are anonymous or rely on pseudonyms. Additionally, many calligraphers have created calligraffiti pieces, even though it is not their primary focus. In 2015, Niels Shoe Meulman created the Calligraffiti Ambassadors with the aim of expanding the movement and creating a community of calligraffiti artists. The group has already grown since its inception and includes artists from all over the world. They exhibited some of their work at the Affenfaust Gallery in Hamburg, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calligraffitiambassadors.com/|title=Calligraffiti Ambassadors|website=Calligraffitiambassadors.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cancer immunotherapy''' (sometimes called '''immuno-oncology''') is the artificial stimulation of the [[immune system]] to treat [[cancer]], improving on the system's natural ability to fight cancer. It is an application of the [[basic research|fundamental research]] of [[cancer immunology]] and a growing subspecialty of [[oncology]]. It exploits the fact that [[cancer cells]] often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as [[tumor antigen]]s; they are often [[protein]]s or other macromolecules (e.g. [[carbohydrate]]s). [[Immunotherapy|Immunotherapies]] can be categorized as active, passive or hybrid (active and passive). Active immunotherapy directs the immune system to attack [[tumor]] cells by targeting tumor antigens. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include [[Monoclonal antibody|the use of monoclonal antibodies]], [[lymphocyte]]s and [[cytokine]]s.

Among these, multiple antibody therapies are approved in various jurisdictions to treat a wide range of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korneev KV, Atretkhany KN, Drutskaya MS, Grivennikov SI, Kuprash DV, Nedospasov SA | title = TLR-signaling and proinflammatory cytokines as drivers of tumorigenesis | journal = Cytokine | volume = 89 | pages = 127–35 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 26854213 | doi = 10.1016/j.cyto.2016.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that bind to a target [[antigen]] on the cell surface. The immune system normally uses them to fight [[pathogen]]s. Each antibody is specific to one or a few proteins. Those that bind to tumor antigens treat cancer. [[Cell surface receptor]]s are common targets for antibody therapies and include [[CD20]], [[CD274]] and [[CD279]]. Once bound to a cancer antigen, antibodies can induce [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]], activate the [[complement system]], or prevent a receptor from interacting with its [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], all of which can lead to cell death. Approved antibodies include [[alemtuzumab]], [[ipilimumab]], [[nivolumab]], [[ofatumumab]] and [[rituximab]].

Active cellular therapies usually involve the removal of immune cells from the blood or from a tumor. Those specific for the tumor are grown in culture and returned to the patient where they attack the tumor; alternatively, immune cells can be [[genetically engineer]]ed to express a tumor-specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], cultured and returned to the patient. Cell types that can be used in this way are [[natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]]s, [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]]s, [[cytotoxic T cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. 

Role of DC-NK Cell Interplay in Immunobiology and Immunotherapy

==Cellular immunotherapy==
===Dendritic cell therapy===
[[File:Dendritic_cell_therapy.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Blood cells are removed from the body, incubated with tumour antigen(s) and activated.  Mature dendritic cells are then returned to the original cancer-bearing donor to induce an immune response.]]
Dendritic cell therapy provokes anti-tumor responses by causing dendritic cells to present tumor antigens to lymphocytes, which activates them, priming them to kill other cells that present the antigen. Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the mammalian immune system.&lt;ref name="pmid11481463"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riddell SR | title = Progress in cancer vaccines by enhanced self-presentation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 16 | pages = 8933–35 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11481463 | pmc = 55350 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.171326398 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.8933R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cancer treatment they aid cancer antigen targeting.&lt;ref name="pmid23890062"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palucka K, Banchereau J | title = Dendritic-cell-based therapeutic cancer vaccines | journal = Immunity | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–48 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23890062 | pmc = 3788678 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2013.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only approved cellular cancer therapy based on dendritic cells is [[sipuleucel-T]].

One method of inducing dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates&lt;ref name="pmid27235694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirayama M, Nishimura Y | title = The present status and future prospects of peptide-based cancer vaccines | journal = [[International Immunology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 319–28 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27235694 | doi = 10.1093/intimm/dxw027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or short peptides (small parts of protein that correspond to the protein antigens on cancer cells). These peptides are often given in combination with [[adjuvants]] (highly [[immunogenic]] substances) to increase the immune and anti-tumor responses. Other adjuvants include proteins or other chemicals that attract and/or activate dendritic cells, such as [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF).

Dendritic cells can also be activated ''[[in vivo]]'' by making tumor cells express GM-CSF. This can be achieved by either genetically engineering tumor cells to produce GM-CSF or by infecting tumor cells with an [[oncolytic virus]] that expresses GM-CSF.

Another strategy is to remove dendritic cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated in the presence of tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor [[cell lysate]] (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.

Dendritic cell therapies include the use of antibodies that bind to receptors on the surface of dendritic cells. Antigens can be added to the antibody and can induce the dendritic cells to mature and provide immunity to the tumor. Dendritic cell receptors such as [[TLR3]], [[TLR7]], [[TLR8]] or [[CD40]] have been used as antibody targets.&lt;ref name="pmid23890062" /&gt; Dendritic cell-NK cell interface also has an important role in immunotherapy. The design of new dendritic cell-based vaccination strategies should also encompass NK cell-stimulating potency. It is critical to systematically incorporate NK cells monitoring as an outcome in antitumor DC-based clinical trials &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calmeiro J, Carrascal M , Gomes C, Falcão A, Cruz MT, Neves BM | title = Highlighting the Role of DC-NK Cell Interplay in Immunobiology and Immunotherapy | journal = Dendritic Cells, Intech | date = November 2018 | doi = 10.5772/intechopen.78804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Approved drugs ====
Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) was approved for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant [[prostate cancer]] in 2010. The treatment consists of removal of [[antigen presenting cell]]s from blood by [[leukapheresis]] and growing them with the [[fusion protein]] PA2024 made from GM-CSF and prostate-specific [[prostatic acid phosphatase]] (PAP) and reinfused. This process is repeated three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner TA, Elzey BD, Hahn NM | title = Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) autologous vaccine approved for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer | journal = Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 534–39 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22832254 | doi = 10.4161/hv.19795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oudard S | title = Progress in emerging therapies for advanced prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–89 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23107383 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims RB | title = Development of sipuleucel-T: autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer | journal = Vaccine | volume = 30 | issue = 29 | pages = 4394–97 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22122856 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shore ND, Mantz CA, Dosoretz DE, Fernandez E, Myslicki FA, McCoy C, Finkelstein SE, Fishman MN | title = Building on sipuleucel-T for immunologic treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–16 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23302902 | doi = 10.1177/107327481302000103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAR-T cell therapy ===
{{main|Chimeric antigen receptor}}
The premise of CAR-T immunotherapy is to modify T cells to recognize cancer cells in order to more effectively target and destroy them. Scientists harvest T cells from people, genetically alter them to add a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that specifically recognizes cancer cells, then infuse the resulting CAR-T cells into patients to attack their tumors.

==== Approved drugs ====
[[Tisagenlecleucel]] (Kymriah), a [[chimeric antigen receptor]] (CAR-T) therapy, was approved by FDA in 2017 to treat [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm|title=Press Announcements - FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment removes [[CD19]] positive cells (B-cells) from the body (including the diseased cells, but also normal antibody producing cells).

[[Axicabtagene ciloleucel]] (Yescarta) is another CAR-T therapeutic, approved in 2017 for treatment of [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] (DLBCL).&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm581216.htm|title=FDA approves CAR-T cell therapy to treat adults with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma|publisher=fda.gov|date=2017-10-18|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antibody therapy==
[[File:Engineered_monoclonal_antibodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Many forms of antibodies can be engineered.]]
{{main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}
[[Antibody|Antibodies]] are a key component of the [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]], playing a central role in both recognizing foreign antigens and stimulating an immune response. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins produced by some [[B cells]] and are composed of two regions: an [[Fragment antigen-binding|antigen-binding fragment (Fab)]], which binds to antigens, and a [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fragment crystallizable (Fc)]] region, which interacts with so-called [[Fc receptors]] that are expressed on the surface of different immune cell types including [[macrophages]], [[neutrophils]] and NK cells. Many immunotherapeutic regimens involve antibodies. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology engineers and generates antibodies against specific antigens, such as those present on tumor surfaces. These antibodies that are specific to the antigens of the tumor, can then be injected into a tumor

===Antibody types ===

==== Conjugation ====

Two types are used in cancer treatments:&lt;ref name="pmid22437872" /&gt;

* Naked monoclonal antibodies are antibodies without added elements. Most antibody therapies use this antibody type.
* Conjugated monoclonal antibodies are joined to another molecule, which is either cytotoxic or [[radioactive]]. The toxic chemicals are those typically used as [[chemotherapy]] drugs, but other toxins can be used. The antibody binds to specific antigens on cancer cell surfaces, directing the therapy to the tumor. Radioactive compound-linked antibodies are referred to as radiolabelled. Chemolabelled or immunotoxins antibodies are tagged with chemotherapeutic molecules or toxins, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Fc regions ====
Fc’s ability to bind [[Fc receptors]] is important because it allows antibodies to activate the immune system. Fc regions are varied: they exist in numerous subtypes and can be further modified, for example with the addition of sugars in a process called [[glycosylation]]. Changes in the [[Fc region]] can alter an antibody’s ability to engage Fc receptors and, by extension, will determine the type of immune response that the antibody triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pincetic A, Bournazos S, DiLillo DJ, Maamary J, Wang TT, Dahan R, Fiebiger BM, Ravetch JV | title = Type I and type II Fc receptors regulate innate and adaptive immunity | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 707–16 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25045879 | doi = 10.1038/ni.2939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cancer immunotherapy drugs, including [[PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors]], are antibodies. For example, [[immune checkpoint]] blockers targeting PD-1 are antibodies designed to bind PD-1 expressed by T cells and reactivate these cells to eliminate [[tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Topalian SL, Hodi FS, Brahmer JR, Gettinger SN, Smith DC, McDermott DF, Powderly JD, Carvajal RD, Sosman JA, Atkins MB, Leming PD, Spigel DR, Antonia SJ, Horn L, Drake CG, Pardoll DM, Chen L, Sharfman WH, Anders RA, Taube JM, McMiller TL, Xu H, Korman AJ, Jure-Kunkel M, Agrawal S, McDonald D, Kollia GD, Gupta A, Wigginton JM, Sznol M | title = Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 26 | pages = 2443–54 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22658127 | pmc = 3544539 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1200690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programmed cell death protein 1|Anti-PD-1 drugs]] contain not only an Fab region that binds PD-1 but also an Fc region. Experimental work indicates that the Fc portion of cancer immunotherapy drugs can affect the outcome of treatment. For example, anti-PD-1 drugs with Fc regions that bind inhibitory Fc receptors can have decreased therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahan R, Sega E, Engelhardt J, Selby M, Korman AJ, Ravetch JV | title = FcγRs Modulate the Anti-tumor Activity of Antibodies Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 Axis | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 543 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 28854351 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccell.2015.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging studies have further shown that the Fc region of anti-PD-1 drugs can bind Fc receptors expressed by tumor-associated macrophages. This process removes the drugs from their intended targets (i.e. PD-1 molecules expressed on the surface of T cells) and limits therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arlauckas SP, Garris CS, Kohler RH, Kitaoka M, Cuccarese MF, Yang KS, Miller MA, Carlson JC, Freeman GJ, Anthony RM, Weissleder R, Pittet MJ | title = In vivo imaging reveals a tumor-associated macrophage-mediated resistance pathway in anti-PD-1 therapy | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 389 | pages = eaal3604 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28490665 | pmc = 5734617 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, antibodies targeting the co-stimulatory protein [[CD40]] require engagement with selective Fc receptors for optimal therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahan R, Barnhart BC, Li F, Yamniuk AP, Korman AJ, Ravetch JV | title = Therapeutic Activity of Agonistic, Human Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibodies Requires Selective FcγR Engagement | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 820–31 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27265505 | pmc = 4975533 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccell.2016.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these studies underscore the importance of Fc status in antibody-based [[immune checkpoint]] targeting strategies.

==== Human/non-human balance ====
Antibodies are also referred to as murine, chimeric, humanized and human. Murine antibodies are from a different species  and carry a risk of immune reaction. Chimeric antibodies attempt to reduce murine antibodies' [[immunogenicity]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by replacing part of the antibody with the corresponding human counterpart, known as the constant region. Humanized antibodies are almost completely human; only the [[complementarity determining regions]] of the [[variable region]]s are derived from murine sources. Human antibodies have been produced using unmodified human DNA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harding FA, Stickler MM, Razo J, DuBridge RB | title = The immunogenicity of humanized and fully human antibodies: residual immunogenicity resides in the CDR regions | journal = MAbs | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–65 | date = May–Jun 2010 | pmid = 20400861 | pmc = 2881252 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.2.3.11641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antibody-dependent_cell-mediated_cytotoxicity.png|left|thumb|Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. When the Fc receptors on natural killer (NK) cells interact with Fc regions of antibodies bound to cancer cells, the NK cell releases perforin and granzyme, leading to cancer cell apoptosis.]]

===Cell death mechanisms===

====Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)====
[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) requires antibodies to bind to target cell surfaces. Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region that can be detected by immune system cells via their [[Fc receptor|Fc surface receptors]]. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including NK cells. When NK cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing [[perforin]] and [[granzyme B]] to kill the tumor cell. Examples include [[Rituximab]], [[Ofatumumab]] and Alemtuzumab. Antibodies under development have altered Fc regions that have higher affinity for a specific type of Fc receptor, FcγRIIIA, which can dramatically increase effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner LM, Surana R, Wang S | title = Monoclonal antibodies: versatile platforms for cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 317–27 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20414205 | pmc = 3508064 | doi = 10.1038/nri2744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seidel UJ, Schlegel P, Lang P | title = Natural killer cell mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in tumor immunotherapy with therapeutic antibodies | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 4 | pages = 76 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23543707 | pmc = 3608903 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complement====
The [[complement system]] includes blood proteins that can cause cell death after an antibody binds to the cell surface (the [[classical complement pathway]], among the ways of complement activation). Generally the system deals with foreign pathogens, but can be activated with therapeutic antibodies in cancer. The system can be triggered if the antibody is chimeric, humanized or human; as long as it contains the [[IgG1]] [[Fc region]]. Complement can lead to cell death by activation of the [[membrane attack complex]], known as complement-dependent [[cytotoxicity]]; enhancement of [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]; and CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity occurs when antibodies bind to the cancer cell surface, the C1 complex binds to these antibodies and subsequently protein pores are formed in the cancer [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelderman KA, Tomlinson S, Ross GD, Gorter A | title = Complement function in mAb-mediated cancer immunotherapy | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 158–64 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15036044 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2004.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alemtuzumab====
[[Alemtuzumab]] (Campath-1H) is an anti-[[CD52]] humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of [[fludarabine]]-refractory [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL), [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]], [[peripheral T-cell lymphoma]] and [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]]. CD52 is found on &gt;95% of peripheral blood [[lymphocyte]]s (both T-cells and B-cells) and [[monocyte]]s, but its function in lymphocytes is unknown. It binds to CD52 and initiates its cytotoxic effect by complement fixation and ADCC mechanisms. Due to the antibody target (cells of the immune system) common complications of alemtuzumab therapy are infection, toxicity and [[myelosuppression]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrd JC, Stilgenbauer S, Flinn IW. [http://www.asheducationbook.org/cgi/content/full/2004/1/163 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.] Hematology (Am Soc Hematol Educ Program) 2004: 163–83. Date retrieved: 26/01/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Domagała A, Kurpisz M | title = CD52 antigen – a review | journal = Medical Science Monitor | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–31 | date = Mar–Apr 2001 | pmid = 11257744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dearden C | title = How I treat prolymphocytic leukemia | journal = Blood | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | pages = 538–51 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22649104 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2012-01-380139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atezolizumab====
{{Main|Atezolizumab}}&lt;!--What is Duralumab? A type of Atezolizumab?--&gt;

[[Durvalumab]] (Imfinzi) is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1) molecules. Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:
* have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy.
* have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

====Ipilimumab====
[[Ipilimumab]] (Yervoy) is a human [[IgG1]] antibody that binds the surface protein [[CTLA4]]. In normal physiology T-cells are activated by two signals: the [[T-cell receptor]] binding to an [[antigen]]-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC complex]] and T-cell surface receptor CD28 binding to [[CD80]] or [[CD86]] proteins. CTLA4 binds to CD80 or CD86, preventing the binding of CD28 to these surface proteins and therefore negatively regulates the activation of T-cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21629286"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sondak VK, Smalley KS, Kudchadkar R, Grippon S, Kirkpatrick P | title = Ipilimumab | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 411–12 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21629286 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21900389"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipson EJ, Drake CG | title = Ipilimumab: an anti-CTLA-4 antibody for metastatic melanoma | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 17 | issue = 22 | pages = 6958–62 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21900389 | pmc = 3575079 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21294471"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thumar JR, Kluger HM | title = Ipilimumab: a promising immunotherapy for melanoma | journal = Oncology | volume = 24 | issue = 14 | pages = 1280–88 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21294471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11244047"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambers CA, Kuhns MS, Egen JG, Allison JP | title = CTLA-4-mediated inhibition in regulation of T cell responses: mechanisms and manipulation in tumor immunotherapy | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 19 | pages = 565–94 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11244047 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active [[cytotoxic T-cell]]s are required for the immune system to attack melanoma cells. Normally inhibited active melanoma-specific cytotoxic T-cells can produce an effective anti-tumor response. Ipilumumab can cause a shift in the ratio of [[Regulatory T cell|regulatory T-cells]] to cytotoxic T-cells to increase the anti-tumor response. Regulatory T-cells inhibit other T-cells, which may benefit the tumor.&lt;ref name="pmid21629286" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21900389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21294471" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11244047" /&gt;

==== Nivolumab ====
{{Main|Nivolumab}}

==== Ofatumumab ====
[[Ofatumumab]] is a second generation human [[IgG1]] antibody that binds to [[CD20]]. It is used in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike [[rituximab]], which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less [[immunogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castillo J, Perez K | title = The role of ofatumumab in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia resistant to previous therapies | journal = Journal of Blood Medicine | volume = 1 | pages = 1–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 22282677 | pmc = 3262337 | doi = 10.2147/jbm.s7284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang B | title = Ofatumumab | journal = MAbs | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–31 | date = Jul–Aug 2009 | pmid = 20068404 | pmc = 2726602 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.1.4.8895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pembrolizumab ====
As of 2017, [[pembrolizumab]], which blocks [[PD-1|PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1]], has been used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic [[melanoma]], metastatic [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a second-line treatment for [[head and neck squamous cell carcinoma]] (HNSCC), after [[Platinum-based antineoplastic|platinum-based chemotherapy]], and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (cHL).&lt;ref name=USlabel2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pembrolizumab label |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/125514s014lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 2017}} linked from [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&amp;varApplNo=125514 Index page at FDA website] November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pembrolizumab label at eMC |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/30602|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rituximab ====
[[Rituximab]] is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, developed from its parent antibody [[Ibritumomab]]. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] and follicular lymphoma and [[leukemia]]s such as B-cell [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]. Although the function of CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a [[calcium channel]] involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and [[Complement system|complement-mediated cytotoxicity.]] Other mechanisms include apoptosis{{Clarify|reason=Vague|date=April 2016}} and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keating GM | title = Rituximab: a review of its use in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, low-grade or follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | journal = Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 11 | pages = 1445–76 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20614951 | doi = 10.2165/11201110-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plosker 2003 803–43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plosker GL, Figgitt DP | title = Rituximab: a review of its use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia | journal = Drugs | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 803–43 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12662126 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200363080-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plosker 2003 803–43" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cerny T, Borisch B, Introna M, Johnson P, Rose AL | title = Mechanism of action of rituximab | journal = Anti-Cancer Drugs | volume = 13 Suppl 2 | pages = S3–10 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12710585 | doi = 10.1097/00001813-200211002-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janeway"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janeway |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Janeway |first2=Paul |last2=Travers |first3=Mark |last3=Walport |first4=Mark |last4=Shlomchik |name-list-format=vanc |title=Immunobiology | edition = Fifth |publisher=Garland Science |year=2001 |location=New York and London |pages= |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 |isbn=978-0-8153-4101-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner GJ | title = Rituximab: mechanism of action | journal = Seminars in Hematology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–23 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20350658 | pmc = 2848172 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cytokine therapy==
[[Cytokine]]s are proteins produced by many types of cells present within a tumor. They can modulate immune responses. The tumor often employs them to allow it to grow and reduce the immune response. These immune-modulating effects allow them to be used as drugs to provoke an immune response. Two commonly used cytokines are interferons and interleukins.&lt;ref name="pmid14708024"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dranoff G | title = Cytokines in cancer pathogenesis and cancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–22 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14708024 | doi = 10.1038/nrc1252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interleukin-2]] and [[interferon]]-α are cytokines, proteins that regulate and coordinate the behavior of the immune system. They have the ability to enhance anti-tumor activity and thus can be used as passive cancer treatments. Interferon-α is used in the treatment of [[hairy-cell leukaemia]], [[AIDS]]-related [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[follicular lymphoma]], [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]] and [[malignant melanoma]]. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of [[malignant melanoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]].

===Interferon===
[[Interferon]]s are produced by the immune system. They are usually involved in anti-viral response, but also have use for cancer. They fall in three groups: [[Interferon type I|type I]] (IFNα and IFNβ), [[Interferon type II|type II]] (IFNγ) and [[Type III interferon|type III]] (IFNλ). IFNα has been approved for use in [[hairy-cell leukaemia]], AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, follicular lymphoma, [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]] and melanoma. Type I and II IFNs have been researched extensively and although both types promote anti-tumor immune system effects, only type I IFNs have been shown to be clinically effective. IFNλ shows promise for its anti-tumor effects in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn GP, Koebel CM, Schreiber RD | title = Interferons, immunity and cancer immunoediting | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 836–48 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17063185 | doi = 10.1038/nri1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasfar A, Abushahba W, Balan M, Cohen-Solal KA | title = Interferon lambda: a new sword in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Clinical &amp; Developmental Immunology | volume = 2011 | pages = 349575 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22190970 | pmc = 3235441 | doi = 10.1155/2011/349575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike type I IFNs, [[Interferon gamma]] is not approved yet for the treatment of any cancer.However, improved survival was observed when [[Interferon gamma]] was administrated to patients with [[bladder carcinoma]] and [[melanoma]] cancers. The most promising result was achieved in patients with stage 2 and 3 of [[ovarian carcinoma]].The ''[[in vitro]]'' study of IFN-gamma in cancer cells is more extensive and results indicate anti-proliferative activity of IFN-gamma leading to the growth inhibition or cell death, generally induced by [[apoptosis]] but sometimes by [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Owens L, Heimann K | title = Review of the recombinant human interferon gamma as an immunotherapeutic: Impacts of production platforms and glycosylation | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 240 | pages = 48–60 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27794496 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.10.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interleukin===
[[Interleukin]]s have an array of immune system effects. [[Interleukin-2]] is used in the treatment of [[malignant melanoma]] and [[renal cell carcinoma]]. In normal physiology it promotes both effector T cells and T-regulatory cells, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid14708024" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coventry BJ, Ashdown ML | title = The 20th anniversary of interleukin-2 therapy: bimodal role explaining longstanding random induction of complete clinical responses | journal = Cancer Management and Research | volume = 4 | pages = 215–21 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22904643 | pmc = 3421468 | doi = 10.2147/cmar.s33979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combination immunotherapy==

Combining various immunotherapies such as PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors can enhance anti-tumor response leading to durable responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ott PA, Hodi FS, Kaufman HL, Wigginton JM, Wolchok JD | title = Combination immunotherapy: a road map | journal = Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer | volume = 5 | pages = 16 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28239469 | pmc = 5319100 | doi = 10.1186/s40425-017-0218-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahoney KM, Rennert PD, Freeman GJ | title = Combination cancer immunotherapy and new immunomodulatory targets | journal = Nature Reviews.

Combining checkpoint immunotherapies with pharmaceutical agents has the potential to improve response, and such combination therapies are a highly investigated area of clinical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang J, Shalabi A, Hubbard-Lucey VM | title = Comprehensive analysis of the clinical immuno-oncology landscape | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–91 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29228097 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdx755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunostimulatory drugs such as [[Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor|CSF-1R]] inhibitors and [[Toll-like receptor|TLR]] agonists have been particularly effective in this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perry CJ, Muñoz-Rojas AR, Meeth KM, Kellman LN, Amezquita RA, Thakral D, Du VY, Wang JX, Damsky W, Kuhlmann AL, Sher JW, Bosenberg M, Miller-Jensen K, Kaech SM | title = Myeloid-targeted immunotherapies act in synergy to induce inflammation and antitumor immunity | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 215 | issue = 3 | pages = 877–93 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29436395 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20171435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Rodell CB, Arlauckas SP, Cuccarese MF, Garris CS, Li R, Ahmed MS, Kohler RH, Pittet MJ, Weissleder R |date=2018-05-21|title=TLR7/8-agonist-loaded nanoparticles promote the polarization of tumour-associated macrophages to enhance cancer immunotherapy |journal=Nature Biomedical Engineering |doi=10.1038/s41551-018-0236-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polysaccharide-K==
Japan's [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] approved the use of [[polysaccharide-K]] extracted from the mushroom, ''[[Coriolus versicolor]]'', in the 1980s, to stimulate the immune systems of patients undergoing chemotherapy.

==Research==

===Adoptive T-cell therapy===
[[File:Adoptive_T-cell_therapy.png|thumb|Cancer specific T-cells can be obtained by fragmentation and isolation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or by genetically engineering cells from peripheral blood. The cells are activated and grown prior to transfusion into the recipient (tumour bearer).]]

Adoptive T cell therapy is a form of [[passive immunization]] by the transfusion of T-cells ([[adoptive cell transfer]]). They are found in [[blood]] and tissue and usually activate when they find foreign [[pathogen]]s. Specifically they activate when the T-cell's surface receptors encounter cells that display parts of foreign proteins on their surface antigens. These can be either infected cells, or [[antigen presenting cell]]s (APCs). They are found in normal tissue and in tumor tissue, where they are known as [[tumor infiltrating lymphocyte]]s (TILs). They are activated by the presence of APCs such as dendritic cells that present [[tumor antigen]]s. Although these cells can attack the tumor, the environment within the tumor is highly immunosuppressive, preventing immune-mediated tumour death.&lt;ref name="NatureRev2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Restifo NP, Dudley ME, Rosenberg SA | title = Adoptive immunotherapy for cancer: harnessing the T cell response | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 269–81 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22437939 | doi = 10.1038/nri3191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple ways of producing and obtaining tumour targeted T-cells have been developed. T-cells specific to a tumor antigen can be removed from a tumor sample (TILs) or filtered from blood. Subsequent activation and culturing is performed ''ex vivo,'' with the results reinfused. Activation can take place through gene therapy, or by exposing the T cells to tumor antigens.

As of 2014, multiple ACT clinical trials were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John|last=Carroll|name-list-format=vanc|work=Fierce Biotech|date=December 2013|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/novartispenns-customized-t-cell-wows-ash-stellar-leukemia-data/2013-12-09|title=Novartis/Penn's customized T cell wows ASH with stellar leukemia data}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John|last=Carroll|work=FierceBiotech|date=February 2014|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/servier-stages-entry-high-stakes-car-t-showdown-novartis/2014-02-18|title=Servier stages an entry into high-stakes CAR-T showdown with Novartis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biotech’s Coming Cancer Cure: Supercharge your immune cells to defeat cancer?

The first 2 adoptive T-cell therapies, [[tisagenlecleucel]] and [[axicabtagene ciloleucel]], were approved by the FDA in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm|title=FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States|publisher=fda.gov|date=2017-08-30|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;

Another approach is adoptive transfer of haploidentical [[γδ T cells]] or  [[NK cells]] from a healthy donor. The major advantage of this approach is that these cells do not cause [[GVHD]]. The disadvantage  is frequently impaired function of the transferred cells.&lt;ref name="pmid = 24528541"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm M, Smetak M, Schaefer-Eckart K, Kimmel B, Birkmann J, Einsele H, Kunzmann V | title = Successful adoptive transfer and in vivo expansion of haploidentical γδ T cells | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 45 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24528541 | pmc = 3926263 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-12-45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-CD47 therapy===

Many tumor cells overexpress [[CD47]] to escape [[Immunosurveillance|immunosurveilance]] of host immune system. CD47 binds to its receptor [[Signal-regulatory protein alpha|signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)]] and downregulate [[phagocytosis]] of tumor cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaiswal S, Chao MP, Majeti R, Weissman IL | title = Macrophages as mediators of tumor immunosurveillance | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 212–19 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20452821 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2010.04.001 | pmc = 3646798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, anti-CD47 therapy aims to restore clearance of tumor cells. Additionally, growing evidence supports the employment of tumor antigen-specific [[Cell-mediated immunity|T cell response]] in response to anti-CD47 therapy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiskopf K | title = Cancer immunotherapy targeting the CD47/SIRPα axis | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 76 | pages = 100–09 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28286286 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2017.02.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matlung HL, Szilagyi K, Barclay NA, van den Berg TK | title = The CD47-SIRPα signaling axis as an innate immune checkpoint in cancer | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 276 | issue = 1 | pages = 145–64 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28258703 | doi = 10.1111/imr.12527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of therapeutics is being developed, including anti-CD47 [[antibodies]], engineered [[decoy receptors]], anti-SIRPα [[Antibody|antibodies]] and bispecific agents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of 2017, wide range of solid and hematologic malignancies were being clinically tested.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veillette A, Chen J | title = SIRPα-CD47 Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Anticancer Therapy | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 173–84 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29336991 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2017.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-GD2 antibodies===
[[File:GD2_ganglioside.png|thumb|The GD2 ganglioside]]
[[Carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s on the surface of cells can be used as targets for immunotherapy. [[GD2]] is a [[ganglioside]] found on the surface of many types of cancer cell including [[neuroblastoma]], [[retinoblastoma]], [[melanoma]], [[small cell lung cancer]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[osteosarcoma]], [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[Ewing’s sarcoma]], [[liposarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[leiomyosarcoma]] and other [[soft tissue sarcoma]]s. It is not usually expressed on the surface of normal tissues, making it a good target for immunotherapy. As of 2014, clinical trials were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmed M, Cheung NK | title = Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 588 | issue = 2 | pages = 288–97 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24295643 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2013.11.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Immune checkpoint blockade}} Immune checkpoints === &lt;!--"Checkpoint inhibitor" redirects here--&gt;
{{Main|Immune checkpoint|Immunotherapy}}
[[File:11 Hegasy CTLA4 PD1 Immunotherapy.png|left|thumb|440x440px|Cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation (CTLA4, PD1)]]
[[Immune checkpoint]]s affect immune system function. Immune checkpoints can be stimulatory or inhibitory. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks. Currently approved checkpoint therapies block inhibitory checkpoint receptors. Blockade of negative feedback signaling to immune cells thus results in an enhanced immune response against tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid22437870"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pardoll DM | title = The blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 252–64 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22437870 | pmc = 4856023 | doi = 10.1038/nrc3239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One ligand-receptor interaction under investigation is the interaction between the transmembrane [[programmed cell death 1]] protein (PDCD1, PD-1; also known as CD279) and its ligand, [[Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1|PD-1 ligand 1]] (PD-L1, CD274). PD-L1 on the cell surface binds to PD1 on an immune cell surface, which inhibits immune cell activity. Among PD-L1 functions is a key regulatory role on T cell activities. It appears that (cancer-mediated) upregulation of PD-L1 on the cell surface may inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack. PD-L1 on cancer cells also inhibits FAS- and interferon-dependent apoptosis, protecting cells from cytotoxic molecules produced by T cells. Antibodies that bind to either PD-1 or PD-L1 and therefore block the interaction may allow the T-cells to attack the tumor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Granier C, De Guillebon E, Blanc C, Roussel H, Badoual C, Colin E, Saldmann A, Gey A, Oudard S, Tartour E | title = Mechanisms of action and rationale for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer | journal = ESMO Open | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = e000213 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28761757 | pmc = 5518304 | doi = 10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CTLA-4 blockade ====
The first checkpoint antibody approved by the FDA was ipilimumab, approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron F, Whiteside G, Perry C | title = Ipilimumab: first global approval | journal = Drugs | volume = 71 | issue = 8 | pages = 1093–104 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21668044 | doi = 10.2165/11594010-000000000-00000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It blocks the immune checkpoint molecule [[CTLA-4]]. Clinical trials have also shown some benefits of anti-CTLA-4 therapy on lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, specifically in combination with other drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch TJ, Bondarenko I, Luft A, Serwatowski P, Barlesi F, Chacko R, Sebastian M, Neal J, Lu H, Cuillerot JM, Reck M | title = Ipilimumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment in stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer: results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase II study | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 17 | pages = 2046–54 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22547592 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.4032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le DT, Lutz E, Uram JN, Sugar EA, Onners B, Solt S, Zheng L, Diaz LA, Donehower RC, Jaffee EM, Laheru DA | title = Evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene in previously treated pancreatic cancer | journal = Journal of Immunotherapy | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 382–89 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23924790 | pmc = 3779664 | doi = 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31829fb7a2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In on-going trials the combination of CTLA-4 blockade with PD-1 or [[PD-L1 inhibitor]]s is tested on different types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01928394|A Study of Nivolumab by Itself or Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, patients treated with check-point blockade (specifically CTLA-4 blocking antibodies), or a combination of check-point blocking antibodies, are at high risk of suffering from immune-related adverse events such as dermatologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or hepatic [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Postow MA, Callahan MK, Wolchok JD | title = Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Cancer Therapy | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 17 | pages = 1974–82 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25605845 | pmc = 4980573 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2014.59.4358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are most likely due to the breadth of the induced T-cell activation when anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are administered by injection in the blood stream.

Using a mouse model of bladder cancer, researchers have found that a local injection of a low dose anti-CTLA-4 in the tumour area had the same tumour inhibiting capacity as when the antibody was delivered in the blood.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Hooren L, Sandin LC, Moskalev I, Ellmark P, Dimberg A, Black P, Tötterman TH, Mangsbo SM | title = Local checkpoint inhibition of CTLA-4 as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1 prevents the growth of murine bladder cancer | journal = European Journal of Immunology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 385–93 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27873300 | doi = 10.1002/eji.201646583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the levels of circulating antibodies were lower, suggesting that local administration of the anti-CTLA-4 therapy might result in fewer adverse events.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====PD-1 inhibitors====
Initial clinical trial results with IgG4 PD1 antibody [[Nivolumab]] were published in 2010.&lt;ref name="pmid22437870" /&gt; It was approved in 2014. Nivolumab is approved to treat melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/food-and-drug-administration-immunotherapy-bladder-cancer.html|title=F.D.A.

[[Pembrolizumab]] is another PD1 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2014. 
Keytruda ([[Pembrolizumab]]) is approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Antibody [[BGB-A317]] is a PD-1 inhibitor (designed to not bind Fc gamma receptor I) in early clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/06/05/846118/0/en/BeiGene-Presents-Initial-Clinical-Data-on-PD-1-Antibody-BGB-A317-at-the-2016-American-Society-of-Clinical-Oncology-Annual-Meeting.html|title=BeiGene Presents Initial Clinical Data on PD-1 Antibody BGB-A317 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting|author=BeiGene, Ltd.|publisher=Globe Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PD-L1 inhibitors====
{{main|PD-L1 inhibitor}}In May 2016, PD-L1 inhibitor [[atezolizumab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2016-04-11.htm|title=FDA grants priority review for Roche's cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in specific type of lung cancer|last1=Roche}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved  for treating bladder cancer.

====Other====

Other modes of enhancing [adoptive] immuno-therapy include targeting so-called [[intrinsic checkpoint blockade]]s e.g. [[CISH]]. A number of cancer patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Response rate may be improved by combining immune checkpoint blockade with additional rationally selected anticancer therapies (out of which some may stimulate T cell infiltration into tumors). For example, targeted therapies such, radiotherapy, vasculature targeting agents, and immunogenic chemotherapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfirschke C, Engblom C, Rickelt S, Cortez-Retamozo V, Garris C, Pucci F, Yamazaki T, Poirier-Colame V, Newton A, Redouane Y, Lin YJ, Wojtkiewicz G, Iwamoto Y, Mino-Kenudson M, Huynh TG, Hynes RO, Freeman GJ, Kroemer G, Zitvogel L, Weissleder R, Pittet MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Immunogenic Chemotherapy Sensitizes Tumors to Checkpoint Blockade Therapy | journal = Immunity | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–54 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26872698 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.11.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can improve immune checkpoint blockade response in animal models of cancer.

===Oncolytic virus===
An [[oncolytic virus]] is a virus that preferentially infects and kills cancer cells. As the infected cancer cells are destroyed by [[oncolysis]], they release new infectious virus particles or virions to help destroy the remaining tumour. Oncolytic viruses are thought not only to cause direct destruction of the tumour cells, but also to stimulate host anti-tumour immune responses for long-term immunotherapy.&lt;ref name=pmid27486853&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fukuhara H, Ino Y, Todo T | title = Oncolytic virus therapy: A new era of cancer treatment at dawn | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 107 | issue = 10 | pages = 1373–79 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27486853 | pmc = 5084676 | doi = 10.1111/cas.13027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid28589082&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haddad D | title = Genetically Engineered Vaccinia Viruses As Agents for Cancer Treatment, Imaging, and Transgene Delivery | journal = Frontiers in Oncology | volume = 7 | pages = 96 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28589082 | pmc = 5440573 | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2017.00096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29329556&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marin-Acevedo JA, Soyano AE, Dholaria B, Knutson KL, Lou Y | title = Cancer immunotherapy beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors | journal = Journal of Hematology &amp; Oncology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29329556 | pmc = 5767051 | doi = 10.1186/s13045-017-0552-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential of viruses as anti-cancer agents was first realized in the early twentieth century, although coordinated research efforts did not begin until the 1960s. A number of viruses including adenovirus, reovirus, measles, herpes simplex, Newcastle disease virus and vaccinia have now been clinically tested as oncolytic agents. T-Vec is the first FDA-approved [[oncolytic virus]] for the treatment of melanoma.  A number of other oncolytic viruses are in Phase II-III development.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Polysaccharides===

Certain compounds found in [[Medicinal mushrooms|mushrooms]], primarily [[polysaccharide]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, can up-regulate the immune system and may have anti-cancer properties. For example, [[Beta-glucans|beta-glucan]]s such as [[lentinan]] have been shown in laboratory studies to stimulate [[macrophage]], [[NK cells]], [[T cells]] and immune system [[cytokines]] and have been investigated in clinical trials as [[immunologic adjuvant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aleem E | title = β-Glucans and their applications in cancer therapy: focus on human studies | journal = Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 709–19 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23140353 | doi = 10.2174/1871520611313050007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoantigens ===
{{Main|Neoantigen}}Many tumors express mutations. These mutations potentially create new targetable antigens (neoantigens) for use in T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high [[Tumor Mutational Burden|mutational burden]]. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched for a series of [[tetrapeptide]] motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit.&lt;ref name="SnyderMakarov2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyder A, Makarov V, Merghoub T, Yuan J, Zaretsky JM, Desrichard A, Walsh LA, Postow MA, Wong P, Ho TS, Hollmann TJ, Bruggeman C, Kannan K, Li Y, Elipenahli C, Liu C, Harbison CT, Wang L, Ribas A, Wolchok JD, Chan TA | title = Genetic basis for clinical response to CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 23 | pages = 2189–99 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25409260 | pmc = 4315319 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1406498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.&lt;ref name="ss15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schumacher TN, Schreiber RD | title = Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy | journal = Science | volume = 348 | issue = 6230 | pages = 69–74 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25838375 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaa4971 | bibcode = 2015Sci...348...69S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaotic rotation''' involves the irregular and unpredictable [[rotation]] of an astronomical body. Unlike [[Earth's rotation]], a chaotic rotation may not have a fixed axis or period. Because of the [[conservation of angular momentum]], chaotic rotation is not seen in objects that are [[spherically symmetric]] or well isolated from gravitational interaction, but is the result of the interactions within a system of orbiting bodies, similar to those associated with [[orbital resonance]].

Examples of chaotic rotation include [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]],&lt;ref&gt;

}}
'''Cosmeston Medieval Village''' is a "living history" medieval village near [[Lavernock]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] not far from [[Penarth]] and [[Cardiff]] in south [[Wales]]. Based upon remains discovered during a 1980s [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig in the grounds of [[Cosmeston Lakes Country Park]], it is a re-creation of 14th century peasant life in [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages]].

The reconstructed village regularly plays host to groups of [[historical reenactment|reenactors]], who camp in authentic tents around the outskirts of the village, and perform displays of [[medieval warfare|historical combat]] for the public.

==History==

===Early medieval===
The original Cosmeston village grew around a [[fortified manor house]] constructed sometime around the 12th century by the De Costentin family, who were among the first [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman invasion of Wales|invaders of Wales]] in the early 12th century following [[William the Conqueror]]'s invasion of neighbouring England in 1066. It is unlikely that the manor house at the site was a substantial building and there is documentary evidence that by 1437 the manor house had already fallen into total ruin. Its precise site has just been located. The village would have consisted of a number of small stone round houses, or crofts, with [[thatching|thatched]] roofs, as depicted in the current reconstruction, and the village population would have been between 50 and 100 people at most, including children.

The de Costentin family originated on the Cotentin peninsula in northern [[France]]. They were the first lords of the manor and they called the village Costentinstune, which over time became known as Cosmeston. They built the original manor house and, perhaps, a few dwellings or small farms, but for the next two centuries it appears that little further development occurred.

===Later medieval period===
Around 1316 the manor passed into the hands of the de Caversham family, also of [[Normans|Norman]] descent.

The buildings that have been excavated so far seem to be from the 14th century. It would appear that the de Caversham family brought a more designed approach to the development of the community and a better regulated and more compact settlement began to develop during their stewardship of the village.

There is little sign that the village continued to develop much past the later [[middle ages]]. Unusually, no Norman church was ever established in the immediate area, so by 1824 all that remained of Cosmeston village were four isolated crofts and the Little Cosmeston Farmhouse as shown on the [[Marquis of Bute]]'s detailed maps of the time. It is quite possible that the majority of the villagers were wiped out during the [[Black Death]] plague of the 1340s or the later outbreaks, leaving Cosmeston a [[Deserted medieval village]].

In addition to the plague, the villagers would have had to combat other difficulties. The land is low-lying and at the mercy of the many water sources that now feed the Cosmeston Lake. There is substantial evidence of drainage dykes, but even they would have struggled to keep the arable land free from waterlogging and constant flooding. Additionally the period was one of permanent political upheaval with intermittent resistance and armed conflict between several local Welsh leaders.  In January 1316, for instance, [[Llywelyn Bren]] attacked [[Caerphilly Castle]], and for the next two months there was conflict and devastation throughout the Glamorgan region.

===Modern history===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Cosmeston Medieval Village.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmeston village]] --&gt;
By the 20th century all evidence of the village had vanished and local residents had no idea of its previous existence. When the Snocem Concrete works and the Cosmeston limestone quarry closed in 1970, the land was developed under [[Countryside Commission]] funding as a [[country park]]. During the landscaping of the new country park the [[earthworks (archaeology)|first evidence]] of the medieval village was unearthed and an [[excavation (archaeology)|archeological exploration]] was undertaken.

The resulting heritage reconstruction has been described as the best representation of a medieval village currently available in Britain. In addition to being open to the general public, the village accepts school tours and archeological groups, together with staging of special events and [[medieval reenactment|re-enactment]]s throughout the year.

===The present===
Cosmeston has been used as a film location for many productions, including a 2014 episode of the hit BBC TV drama series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' and ''[[Galavant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/uk-based-abc-series-galavant-to-premiere-on-sunday|title=British Film Commission - Galavant to premiere on Sunday|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|a person's choice to deny reality, as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth}}
In the psychology of [[human behavior]], '''denialism''' is a person's choice to [[denial|deny]] [[reality]], as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable [[truth]].{{sfn|Maslin|2009}} Denialism is an essentially [[irrational]] action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an [[empirical]]ly verifiable reality.{{sfn|O'Shea|2008|p=20}} In the sciences, denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed, well-supported parts of the [[scientific consensus]] on a subject, in favor of radical and controversial ideas.{{sfn|Scudellari|2010}} The terms ''[[Holocaust denialism]]'' and ''[[AIDS denialism]]'' describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters,&lt;ref&gt;Usages of Holocaust and AIDS denialism:
{{harvnb|Kim|2007}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|2007}}; {{harvnb|Smith|Novella|2007|p=e256}}; {{harvnb|Watson|2006|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Nature Medicine's editor|2006|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''[[climate change denial]]'' describes denial of the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that the [[climate change]] of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;Usages of global-warming denialism: {{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|page=425}} {{harvnb|Colquhoun|2009|p=b3658}}; {{harvnb|Connelly|2007}}; {{harvnb|Goodman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus.{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}
The motivations and causes of denialism include religion and self-interest (economic, political, financial) and [[defence mechanisms]] meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas.{{sfn|Hambling|2009}}{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}}

==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
Anthropologist [[Didier Fassin]] distinguishes between ''[[denial]]'', defined as "the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied", and ''denialism'', which he defines as "an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth".&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"&gt;Didier Fassin, ''When bodies remember: experiences and politics of AIDS in South Africa'', Volume 15 of California Series in Public Anthropology, [[University of California Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25027-7}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jn9yoyuEV1YC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and [[scientific consensus]] engage in ''denialism'' when they use [[rhetoric]]al tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate, when there is none.{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}} Rick Stoff quoted [[Chris Hoofnagle]]—a senior staff attorney at the [[Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic]] and a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]]—as follows:
{{quote|Then there are those who engage in denialist tactics because they are protecting some "overvalued idea" which is critical to their identity. Since legitimate dialogue is not a valid option for those who are interested in protecting bigoted or unreasonable ideas from scientific facts, their only recourse is to use these types of rhetorical tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoff |first=Rick |date=June 2007 |title='Denialism' and muddying the waters |journal=St. Louis Journalism Review |volume=37 |issue=296 |pages=21–33, 2p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2003 newspaper article, [[Edwin Cameron]]—a senior South African judge who has [[AIDS]]—described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and by those who deny that the [[AIDS pandemic]] is due to infection with HIV. He states that "For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence".&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic-90503.html The dead hand of denialism] [[Edwin Cameron]]. [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this they employ "distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic."&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt;  Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to "make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics",&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt; as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources.

A 2009 article published in the journal ''[[Globalization and Health]]'' also notes "recourse to data debates and [[pseudo-scientific]] 'evidence{{'"}} as a common feature of several types of denialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chazan M, Brklacich M, Whiteside A |title=Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research |journal=[[Global Health]] |volume=5 |issue= |page=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19807923 |pmc=2764568 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-5-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area which British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] mentioned as part of his analysis of the [[David Irving]]'s work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued  [[Deborah Lipstadt]] for libel:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 6. General Conclusion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140414/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 |date=October 12, 2007 }} Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Mark Hoofnagle]] (brother of [[Chris Hoofnagle]]) has described denialism as "the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none".{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}{{efn|"AIDS denialism is one of several incarnations of denialism. All denialism is defined by rhetorical tactics designed to give the impression of a legitimate debate among experts when in fact there is none. [[Holocaust deniers]] claim that historians disagree about the evidence for Nazi mass gassings and systematic murder of Jews. Global warming denialists say that climatologists are torn by the evidence about climate change. [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 'Truth Seekers']], as clever a piece of branding as '[[pro-life]]', say the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] resulted from controlled demolition. Vaccine hysterics tell us that the science is split on whether vaccinations cause autism. And AIDS denialists say that scientists are in disagreement about whether HIV causes AIDS" {{harv|Kalichman|2009}}.}} It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics in order to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy:{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/mar/10/climate-change-denier |title= Climate change deniers: failsafe tips on how to spot them |publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]'' |author= Mark Hoofnagle |date= 11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Conspiracy theories]] – Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in "a conspiracy to suppress the truth".
# [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] – Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research.
# [[False attribution|False experts]] – Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility.
# [[Moving the goalpost]] – Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence.
# Other [[logical fallacies]] – Usually one or more of [[false analogy]], [[appeal to consequences]], [[straw man]], or [[red herring]].

Tara Smith of the [[University of Iowa]] also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the "majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory" in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own "unproven ideas will fill the void".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310459&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The fanaticism of denial that must be exposed |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |author=Tara Smith |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 author [[Michael Specter]] defined group denialism as "when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie".&lt;ref name="Specter 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prescriptive and polemic==
If one party to a debate accuses the other of ''denialism'' they are framing the debate. This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and [[polemic]]. Prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim; [[polemic]] since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other's motives.&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"/&gt;

Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known, advocates who use the term "denialist" in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than holocaust deniers. For example, in an essay discussing the general importance of skepticism, [[Clive James]] objected to the use of the word denialist to describe climate change skeptics, stating that it "calls up the spectacle of a fanatic denying the Holocaust";{{sfn|James|2009}} and [[Celia Farber]] has objected to the term ''AIDS denialists'', arguing that it is unjustifiable to place this belief on the same moral level with the Nazi crimes against humanity.{{sfn|Farber|2006}} However, [[Robert Gallo]] ''et al.'' defended this latter comparison, stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of [[pseudoscience]] that "contradicts an immense body of research".{{sfn|Gallo|Geffen|Gonsalves|Jefferys|2006}}

Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at [[Exeter University]], has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of "deny", akin to "disown" (as in the [[Apostle Peter]] [[Denial of Peter|denying Jesus]]), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that "An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness." He suggests that, by the introduction of the word ''denier'' into further areas of historical and scientific debate, "One of the great achievements of [[The Enlightenment]]—the liberation of historical and [[scientific enquiry]] from [[dogma]]—is quietly being reversed", and that this should worry liberal-minded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Edward |last=Skidelsky |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/words-that-think-for-us-3/ |title=Words that think for us: The tyranny of denial |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]| accessdate=10 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use: scientific denialism==

===Flat Earth===
{{main|Flat Earth|Modern flat Earth societies}}

The [[superseded scientific theories|superseded belief]] that the [[Earth]] is [[flat Earth|flat]], and [[denial]] of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately [[spheroid]] [[globe]] that rotates around its axis and revolves around the [[Sun]], persists into the [[21st century]]. Modern proponents of flat-Earth [[cosmology]] (or [[flat-earther]]s) refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence, dismissing all [[spaceflight]]s and images from space as [[hoax]]es and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of [[conspiracy theory|conspiring]] to "hide the truth". They also claim that no actual [[satellite]]s are [[orbit]]ing the Earth, that the [[International Space Station]] is fake, and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand [[cover-up]].

[[belief perseverance|Adherents]] of the modern flat-Earth model propose that a dome-shaped [[firmament]] encloses a disk-shaped Earth. They commonly claim that the Sun is only [[Samuel Rowbotham|3,000 miles]] above the Earth and that the [[Moon]] and the Sun orbit above, but not around, a flat Earth. Modern flat-earthers believe that [[Antarctica]] is not a continent but a massive [[ice flow]], with a wall 150 feet or higher, which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything (including all the oceans' water) from falling off the edge.

Flat-earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore [[Antarctica]], despite contrary evidence. According to them, all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city [[skyline]]s and clouds below the horizon, revealing the [[curvature of the Earth]], have been [[photo manipulation|manipulated]], [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or somehow faked. Therefore, regardless of any scientific or [[empirical evidence]] provided, flat-earthers will [[delusion|stubbornly conclude]] it is fabricated or altered in some way.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listverse.com/2016/02/01/10-absurd-claims-of-modern-flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists/ |title=10 Absurd Claims of Modern Flat Earth Conspiracy Theorists |last=Nixon |first=Eli |publisher=Listverse |date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity, sunsets, tides, eclipses, distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model, claimants replace commonly-accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort how perspective, mass, boyancy, light or other physical systems work.  These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other, finally leaving many flat-Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain "mysteries" and more investigation is to be done.  In this conclusion, adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model, shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism.

[[AIDS denialism]] is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Essex M |title=AIDS denialism and public health practice |journal=AIDS Behav |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=237–47 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20058063 |doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS denialism has been described as being "among the most vocal anti-science denial movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalichman SC, Eaton L, Cherry C |title="There is no Proof that HIV Causes AIDS": AIDS Denialism Beliefs among People Living with HIV/AIDS |journal=J Behav Med |volume= 33|issue= 6|pages= 432–40|date=June 2010 |pmid=20571892 |doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7 |pmc=3015095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless [[passenger virus]] and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of [[recreational drug use]], malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral medication]], rather than infection with HIV. However, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive&lt;ref name=iomreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&amp;page=2 |title=Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 |publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] |year=1988 |quote=…the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=niaid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/howhivcausesaids/pages/hivcausesaids.aspx |title=The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS |accessdate=2010-10-08 |publisher=[[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease]] |date=2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[scientific community]] rejects and ignores AIDS-denialist claims as based on faulty reasoning, [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]], and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data.{{efn|To support their ideas, some AIDS denialists have also misappropriated a scientific review in ''Nature Medicine'' which opens with this reasonable statement: "Despite considerable advances in HIV science in the past 20 years, the reason why HIV-1 infection is pathogenic is still debated" {{harv|Borowski|2006|p=369}}.}} With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, AIDS-denialist material is now spread mainly through the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="NewScientist"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227131.500-aids-denial-a-lethal-delusion.html |title=AIDS denial: A lethal delusion |first=J |last=Steinberg |journal=New Scientist |accessdate=2009-10-14 |date=2009-06-17 |volume=2713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
{{main|Climate change denial}}
{{see also|Politicization of science}}
Some international corporations, such as [[ExxonMobil]], have contributed to "fake citizens' groups and bogus scientific bodies" that claim that the [[scientific opinion on climate change|science]] of [[global warming]] is inconclusive, according to a criticism by [[George Monbiot]].{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}} ExxonMobil did not deny making the financial contributions, but its spokesman stated that the company's financial support for scientific reports did not mean it [[funding bias|influenced the outcome]] of those studies. "The recycling of this type of discredited [[conspiracy theory]] diverts attention from the real challenge at hand: how to provide the energy needed to improve global living standards while also [[mitigation of global warming|reducing]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]: ''[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/08/07/gore-exxon.html Gore takes aim at corporately funded climate research].''

In the context of [[consumer protection]], denialism has been defined as "the use of rhetorical techniques and predictable tactics to erect barriers to debate and consideration of any type of reform, regardless of the facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=962462 |title=Denialists' Deck of Cards: An Illustrated Taxonomy of Rhetoric Used to Frustrate Consumer Protection Efforts |first=Chris Jay |last=Hoofnagle|date=February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]'s replacement of previous science advisers with industry experts or scientists tied to industry, and its refusal to submit the [[Kyoto Protocol]] for ratification due to uncertainties they asserted were present in the climate change issue, have been cited by the press as examples of politically motivated denialism.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070912031936/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20113753/site/newsweek/ Timeline, Climate Change and its Naysayers] [[Newsweek]] August 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tim |last=Dickinson |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/15148655/the_secret_campaign_of_president_george_bushs_administration_to_deny_global |title=The Secret Campaign of President Bush's Administration To Deny Global Warming |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
{{main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution. [[Evolution]] is still considered an undisputed fact within the [[scientific community]] and in [[academia]], where the [[level of support for evolution]] is essentially universal, yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists.{{sfn|Myers|2006}}{{sfn|NSTA|2007}}{{sfn|IAP|2006}}{{sfn|AAAS|2006}}{{sfn|Pinholster|2006}} The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]]'s [[creation myth]]. Many [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christians teach [[creationism]] as if it were fact under the banners of [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]]. Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global [[flood myth]], [[geocentrism]], and the belief that the [[Young Earth creationism|Earth is only 6,000-10,000]]  [[Age of the Earth|years old]].&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

===Animal pain and suffering===
{{quote box
|title = ''Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness'' (2012)
|quote = The absence of a [[neocortex]] does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit [[Intention|intentional behaviors]]. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the [[neurological substrate]]s that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|title=The Cambridge declaration on consciousness|date=July 7, 2012|author=Low, P.|editor1=Jaak Panksepp |editor2=Diana Reiss |editor3=David Edelman |editor4=Bruno Van Swinderen |editor5=Philip Low |editor6=Christof Koch |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite wide scientific consensus that [[pain in animals|some animals can experience pain]] and suffering,&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt; this is often denied when it is convenient for people to do so. Such denial occurs for animals on farms, in laboratories, and those used for entertainment,&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wicks, D.|title=Silence and denial in everyday life - The case of animal suffering|journal=Animals|volume=1|issue=1|year=2011|pages=186–199|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/1/1/186/htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reus, E.  |author2=Olivier, D.|year=2007|title=Mind-matter for animals matters: Science and the denial of animal consciousness|journal=[[Between the Species]]|volume=13|issue=7|pages=6|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2007v13n7.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sollund"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sollund, R.|editor=Sollund, R.|year=2008|chapter=Causes for speciesism: Difference, distance and denial|title=Global Harms: Ecological Crime and Speciesism|publisher=New York: Nova Science Publishers|pages=109–131|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=7439}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animals may come to be viewed as [[Commodity status of animals|commodities]]. A study in 2013 reported that male undergraduates in the US denied animal suffering to justify eating meat.&lt;ref name="Rothgerber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rothgerber, H.|year=2013|title=Real men don’t eat (vegetable) quiche: Masculinity and the justification of meat consumption|journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity|volume=14|issue=4|pages=363–375|doi=10.1037/a0030379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial of animal pain and suffering is often inconsistent between related species. Such beliefs have led to the publication of books such as ''[[Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows]]'' written by social psychologist [[Melanie Joy]] in which she popularised the term ''[[carnism]]''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011"&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Joy, M.|title=Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=1573245054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of animal pain and suffering can also lead to denial of broader concepts, such as denial of moral status&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson, S.D.|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/|accessdate=July 9, 2016|publisher=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|title=Animals and ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the existence of "mind"&lt;ref name="Bastian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bastian, B., Loughnan, S., Haslam, N. and Radke, H.R.|year=2012|title=Don’t mind meat?

The idea that animals might not feel pain goes back to the 17th-century French philosopher, [[René Descartes]], who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack [[Animal consciousness|consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Carbone149"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carbone, L.|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iheg3hkj99AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22What+Animal+Want:+Expertise+and+Advocacy+in+Laboratory+Animal+Welfare+Policy%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=149|isbn=9780195161960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radner"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Radner, D.|author2=Radner, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989|title=Animal Consciousness|publisher=Prometheus Books: Buffalo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harrison, P.|year=1992|title=Descartes on animals|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|pages=219–227|volume=42|issue=167|doi=10.2307/2220217|jstor=2220217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray, M.|year=2008|title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering|publisher=Oxford University Press on Demand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holocaust===
{{main|Holocaust denial}}
The term has been used with "[[Holocaust denial]]ism" as "the refusal to accept an [[empiricism|empirically]] verifiable reality. It is an essentially [[Emotional|irrational]] action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event."&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, ''A Cross Too Heavy: Eugenio Pacelli, Politics and the Jews of Europe 1917-1943'', Rosenberg Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|1-877058-71-8}}.

'''Early Netherlandish painting''' is the work of artists, sometimes known as the '''Flemish Primitives''', active in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] and [[Habsburg Netherlands]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]], especially in the flourishing cities of [[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Mechelen]], [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], [[Tournai]] and [[Brussels]], all in present-day [[Belgium]]. The period begins approximately with [[Robert Campin]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of [[Gerard David]] in 1523,&lt;ref name = "Spronk7"&gt;Spronk (1996), 7&lt;/ref&gt; although many scholars extend it to the start of the [[Dutch Revolt]] in 1566 or 1568 ([[Max J. Friedländer]]'s acclaimed surveys run through [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and [[High Renaissance|High]] [[Italian Renaissance]] but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the [[Renaissance humanism]] that characterised developments in Italy, although beginning in the 1490s as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, [[Renaissance]] ideals and painting styles were incorporated into Netherlandish and other Northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the [[Northern Renaissance]] and the Late or [[International Gothic]].

The major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Dieric Bouts]], [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Hugo van der Goes]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and [[illusionism (art)|illusionism]], and their work typically features complex [[iconography]].  Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of [[diptych]]s, [[triptych]]s or [[polyptych]]s. The period is also noted for its sculpture, [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[stained glass]] and carved [[retable]]s.

The first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the [[Low Countries]] became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of [[iconoclasm]] in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated.

Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th- and 20th-century art history, and a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: [[Max J. Friedländer]] (''From Van Eyck to Breugel'' and ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'') and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'').

==Terminology and scope==
The term "Early Netherlandish art" applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries&lt;ref name = "Spronk7"/&gt; in the northern European areas controlled by the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Dukes of Burgundy]] and later the [[Seventeen Provinces|Habsburg dynasty]]. These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style. In this political and art-historical context, the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name ="Pächt30"&gt;Pächt (1999), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|left|460px|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', completed in 1432 by Jan van Eyck. This polyptych and the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] are generally seen as the first major works of the Early Netherlandish period.]]

The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms. "Late Gothic" is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the [[medieval art|art of the Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="janson"&gt;Janson, H.W. (2006), 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the artists were variously referred to in English as the "[[Ghent-Bruges school]]" or the "Old Netherlandish school". "Flemish Primitives" is a traditional art-historical term borrowed from the French ''primitifs flamands''&lt;ref name="C7"/&gt; that became popular after the [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|famous exhibition in Bruges in 1902]]&lt;ref&gt;Deam (1998), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Flemish and Netherlandish art were only distinguished from each other from the early 17th century. See Spronk (1997), 7}} and remains in use today, especially in Dutch and German.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; In this context, "primitive" does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication, but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting. [[Erwin Panofsky]] preferred the term ''[[ars nova]]'' ("new art"), which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Gilles Binchois]], who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 165&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian dukes]] established centres of power in the Netherlands, they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook.&lt;ref name ="Pächt11"/&gt; According to [[Otto Pächt]] a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a "revolution took place in painting"; a "new beauty" in art emerged, one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world.&lt;ref name ="Pächt12"&gt;Pächt (1999), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality, with [[Jan van Eyck]] identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French.&lt;ref name="Deam"&gt;Deam (1998), 15&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school's genesis was in France or Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 271&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and following the leads of [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Friedländer]], Panofsky, and Pächt, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as "Early Netherlandish painting", although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.&lt;ref name="Deam" /&gt;

In the 14th century, as [[Gothic art]] gave way to the [[International Gothic]] era, a number of schools developed in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of [[illuminated manuscript]]s. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as [[Melchior Broederlam]] and [[Robert Campin]], the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship.&lt;ref name ="Pächt11"&gt;Pächt (1999), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and [[House of Valois-Anjou]] dukes such as [[Philip the Bold]], [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Anjou]] and [[Jean, Duke of Berry]]. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, [[Philip the Good]] and his son [[Charles the Bold]].&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined towards the end of the century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and [[old master print|prints]], both [[engraving]]s and [[woodcut]]s, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as [[Martin Schongauer]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref name="n3"&gt;Nash (2008), 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|480px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1490–1510. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. Art historians are divided as to whether the central panel was intended as a moral warning or as a panorama of paradise lost]]
Following van Eyck's innovations, the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow, elements usually absent from 14th-century illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name ="Pächt12ff"&gt;Pächt (1999), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism, which made their content more accessible to viewers, while individual portraits became more evocative and alive.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 19"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Huizinga]] said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine, to "fill with beauty" the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga (2009 ed.), 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style, not least the rise of Italian art, whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510, and overtook it some ten years later. Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift: the transporting of a marble ''[[Madonna of Bruges|Madonna and Child]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] to Bruges in 1506,&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt; and the arrival of [[Raphael]]'s [[Raphael Cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] to Brussels in 1517, which were widely seen while in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 321&lt;/ref&gt; Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north, it in turn had drawn on the 15th-century northern painters, with Michelangelo's ''Madonna'' based on a type developed by [[Hans Memling]].&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt;

Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of [[Gerard David]] in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists.&lt;ref name="C7"&gt;Campbell (1998), 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions.&lt;ref name="h6061"&gt;Harbison (1995), 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of [[Renaissance humanism]], turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 319–322&lt;/ref&gt; A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of [[Northern Mannerism]] around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.&lt;ref name="h60"&gt;Harbison (1995), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;  This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour,&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 25&lt;/ref&gt; peaking with the [[Limbourg brothers]] and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leaves of the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] are usually attributed.&lt;ref name="Harbison29" /&gt; Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]]. According to [[Georges Hulin de Loo]], Hand G's contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours "constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art".&lt;ref name ="Pächt179"&gt;Pächt (1999), 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan van Eyck's use of oil as a medium was a significant development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated,&lt;ref name="Pächt11"/&gt; indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments,&lt;ref name="Toman 2011 322"&gt;Toman (2011), 322&lt;/ref&gt; and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from [[Bohemia]] and Poland in the east to Austria and [[Swabia]] in the south.&lt;ref name ="K55"/&gt;

A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in [[Tournai]].&lt;ref name ="Pächt16"&gt;Pächt (1999), 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vlieghe"&gt;Vlieghe (1998), 187–200. Highlights recent instances where institutions in the [[Wallonia|French-speaking parts of Belgium]] have refused to loan painters to exhibitions labelled "Flemish".&lt;/ref&gt; The German Hans Memling and the Estonian [[Michael Sittow]] both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. [[Simon Marmion]] is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from [[Amiens]], an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471.&lt;ref name="C7" /&gt; The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent.&lt;ref name="b35"&gt;Borchert (2011), 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="C20" /&gt;{{efn-ua|Van Eyck used elements of the [[Greek alphabet]] in his signature, and a number of [[Ghent]] painters taught members of their workshops to read and write.}} A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe.&lt;ref name="a24"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a [[valet de chambre]] at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good.&lt;ref name="a24" /&gt; Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine "Mettengelde" ("with the money").&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Châtelet (1980), 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vrancke van der Stockt]] invested in land.&lt;ref name="C20"/&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of a Lady - Google Art Project.jpg|200px|thumb|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Portrait of a Lady (van der Weyden)|Portrait of a Lady]]'', 1460. [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington. Van der Weyden moved portraiture away from idealisation and towards more naturalistic representation.&lt;ref name="V76"&gt;Van Der Elst (1944), 76&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as [[Stefan Lochner]] and the painter known as the [[Master of the Life of the Virgin]], both of whom, working in mid-15th-century [[Cologne]], drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts.&lt;ref name="TB247"&gt;Borchert (2011), 247&lt;/ref&gt; New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; [[Ulm]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]] were the most important artistic centres in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for [[printmaking]] (using woodcuts or copperplate [[engraving]]) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy.&lt;ref name ="K55"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 55&lt;/ref&gt; Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as [[Jan Gossaert]] made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's ''[[Madonna in the Church]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 319&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard David linked the styles of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]], often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local [[Guild of Saint Luke|painters' guild]], and the two became friends.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Elst (1944), 96&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision.&lt;ref name="TB101"&gt;Borchert (2011), 101&lt;/ref&gt; Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. [[Hieronymus Bosch]], active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref name="t335"&gt;Toman (2011), 335&lt;/ref&gt; He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]''. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the [[triptych]]s, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period&lt;ref name="t335" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Hand et al. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|350px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565. [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna. The most famous of Bruegel's several winter landscapes, the panel is indicative of how painting in the mid-16th century tended towards the secular and everyday life.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background.&lt;ref name = "A326"&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], one of the few who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his [[genre art|genre scenes]] were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.&lt;ref name = "A326"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1998), 381–84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and material==
Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden established [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] as the dominant style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought to show the world as it actually was,&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 378&lt;/ref&gt; and to depict people in a way that made them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted "gold that looked like gold"),&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 163&lt;/ref&gt; paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]. They moved beyond the flat [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.&lt;ref name="j9"&gt;Jones (2011), 9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dieric Bouts - The Entombment - WGA02961.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Dieric Bouts]]'s ''[[The Entombment (Bouts)|The Entombment]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1440–55 ([[National Gallery]], London), is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief, and one of the few surviving 15th-century glue-size paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although, the use of oil as a [[Binder (material)|binding agent]] can be traced to the 12th century, innovations in its handling and manipulation define the era. [[Tempera|Egg tempera]] was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail&lt;ref name="s61"&gt;Smith (2004), 61&lt;/ref&gt; and enable [[wet-on-wet]] techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams,&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 22&lt;/ref&gt; This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.&lt;ref name="Toman 2011 322"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas.{{efn-ua|From contemporary records, it is estimated that about a third were painted on canvas, but as these were far less durable, most extant works are on wooden panels. See Ridderbos (2005), 297}} The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use.&lt;ref name="C29"&gt;Campbell (1998), 29&lt;/ref&gt; Wood supports allow for [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos (2005), 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] notes that most are "beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins".&lt;ref name="C31"&gt;Campbell (1998), 31&lt;/ref&gt; Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, "done for the artist's amusement".&lt;ref name="C29"/&gt; Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk (1997), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.&lt;ref name="C31" /&gt;

[[Glue-size|Glue]] binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived.&lt;ref name="C29" /&gt; Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' ''[[Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1415–25)&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/quinten-massys-the-virgin-and-child-with-saints-barbara-and-catherine The Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511144111/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/quinten-massys-the-virgin-and-child-with-saints-barbara-and-catherine |date=2012-05-11 }}.

''National Gallery'', London. Retrieved 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]].&lt;ref name="C31"/&gt;

==Guilds and workshops==
The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan [[guild]]s to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1976), 190–192&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.&lt;ref name="A34"/&gt;

Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase.&lt;ref name="A34"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 34&lt;/ref&gt; Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with the production of a "[[masterpiece]]" that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants.&lt;ref name="h95"&gt;Harbison (1995), 64&lt;/ref&gt; Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'', in which Christ's body is given the t-shape of a [[crossbow]] to reflect its commission for a chapel for the [[Leuven]] guild of archers.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 9–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices.&lt;ref name="J28"&gt;Jones (2011), 28&lt;/ref&gt; The masters usually built up inventories of pre-painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale.&lt;ref name="A32"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 32&lt;/ref&gt; With the former, the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure's clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak [[Deesis]] passage in van Eyck's ''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych'' being a better-known example.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2008), 86&lt;/ref&gt; Often a master's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 29&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the master would usually produce the [[underdrawing]] or overall composition to be painted by assistants.  As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patronage==

By the 15th century the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast, the north German and Polish regions, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments.&lt;ref name="J28"/&gt; The mid-century saw the development of [[art dealer]]ship as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.&lt;ref name="J25"/&gt;

[[File:Jacques de Guise, Chroniques de Hainaut, frontispiece, KBR 9242.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good]]'', presentation miniature, 1447–1448. [[Royal Library of Belgium]], Brussels]]
Smaller works were not usually produced on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs,&lt;ref name="A37"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 37&lt;/ref&gt; or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt;

Less expensive cloth paintings (''[[Glue-size|tüchlein]]'') were more common in middle-class households, and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt; Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'', which exists in several variations.&lt;ref name="A31"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Burgundian dukes could afford to be extravagant in their taste.&lt;ref name="J25"/&gt; Philip the Good followed the example set earlier in France by his great-uncles including [[John, Duke of Berry]] by becoming a strong patron of the arts and commissioning a large number of artworks.&lt;ref name="patronage"&gt;Chapuis, Julien. "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/valo_1/hd_valo_1.htm Patronage at the Early Valois Court]". ''[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]''. Retrieved 28 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgundian court was seen as the arbiter of taste and their appreciation in turn drove demand for highly luxurious and expensive illuminated manuscripts, gold-edged tapestries and jewel-bordered cups. Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s. While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals, they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art. A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the "excellent work that he does in his craft".&lt;ref name="J25"&gt;Jones (2011), 25&lt;/ref&gt; Jan van Eyck painted the ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' while in Philip's employ, and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke's portrait painter in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="patronage"/&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck The Virgin of Chancellor Rolin.jpg|left|thumb|Jan van Eyck, ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'', c. 1435]]
Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries. Some gained enormous power and commissioned paintings to display their wealth and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Civic leaders also commissioned works from major artists, such as Bouts' ''[[:commons:File:Dirk Bouts - Justice of Emperor Otto III- Beheading of the Innocent Count and Ordeal by Fire - Google Art Project.jpg|Justice for Emperor Otto III]]'', van der Weyden's ''[[The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald]]'' and David's ''[[:commons:File:David Diptych The Judgment of Cambyses.jpg|Justice of Cambyses]]''.&lt;ref name ="A30"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 30&lt;/ref&gt; Civic commissions were less common and were not as lucrative, but they brought notice to and increased a painter's reputation, as with Memling, whose ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'' for Bruges' [[Old St. John's Hospital|Sint-Janshospitaal]] brought him additional civic commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 30, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy foreign patronage and the development of international trade afforded the established masters the chance to build up workshops with assistants.&lt;ref name="J28" /&gt;  Although first-rank painters such as [[Petrus Christus]] and Hans Memling found patrons among the local nobility, they catered specifically to the large foreign population in Bruges.&lt;ref name="A34"/&gt; Painters not only exported goods but also themselves; foreign princes and nobility, striving to emulate the opulence of the Burgundian court, hired painters away from Bruges.&lt;ref name="A25"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua| The [[Federico da Montefeltro|Duke of Urbino]] hired [[Justus van Gent|Joos van Gent]] in c.&amp;nbsp;1473, and [[Isabella I of Castile]] – who owned a collection of 300 paintings – hired [[Michael Sittow]] and [[Juan de Flandes]] ("John of Flanders") into her service. See Ainsworth (1998a), 25–26}}

==Iconography==
[[File:The Magdalen Reading - Rogier van der Weyden.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[The Magdalen Reading]]'', before 1438. [[National Gallery]], London. This fragment is unusually rich in iconographical detail, including the Magdalen's averted eyes, her attribute of ointment, and the concept of Christ as the word represented by the book in her hands.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 392–405&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references.&lt;ref name="w11"&gt;Ward (1994), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 601&lt;/ref&gt; Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the ''[[Life of the Virgin|Life of Mary]]'' vastly predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Powell (2006), 708&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps "the most important aspect of early Flemish art".&lt;ref name ="Harbison601"&gt;Harbison (1984), 601&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic.&lt;ref name="Harbison601"/&gt; Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details.&lt;ref name="w11" /&gt; The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and "was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation".&lt;ref name = "Ward9"&gt;Ward (1994), 9&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's religious paintings in particular "always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality".&lt;ref name="Harbison589"/&gt;  To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, "descriptive data were rearranged&amp;nbsp;... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth."&lt;ref name="Harbison589"&gt;Harbison (1984), 589&lt;/ref&gt;  This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck's belief that the "essential truth of Christian doctrine" can be found in "the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol".&lt;ref name = "H590"&gt;Harbison (1984), 590&lt;/ref&gt; He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.&lt;ref name = "H590"/&gt;

Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols. A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the ''[[Lucca Madonna]]''). More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 590–592&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Eyck's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent. The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing,&lt;ref name="w11" /&gt; while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a "promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1994), 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter the sense of the real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 591–593&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed."&lt;ref name="h596"&gt;Harbison (1984), 596&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of architectural details, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]], colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".&lt;ref name="h596" /&gt;

Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="j14"&gt;Jones (2011), 14&lt;/ref&gt; Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the ''[[Cambrai Madonna]]'' is probably the best known.&lt;ref name="h159"&gt;Harbison (1991), 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.&lt;ref name="j14" /&gt;

Marian devotion grew from the 13th century, mostly forming around the concepts of the [[Immaculate Conception]] and her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption into heaven]]. In a culture that venerated the possession of [[relic]]s as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2005), 18&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in [[limbo]] was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2005), 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the [[Man of Sorrows]].&lt;ref name="j14" /&gt;

Those who could afford to commissioned [[donor portrait]]s. Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych, or later as a more affordable diptych. Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half-length [[Madonna (art)|Marian portraits]]. These echoed the "miracle-working" Byzantine icons then popular in Italy. The format became extremely popular across the north, and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych.&lt;ref name="thb206"&gt;Borchert (2011), 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats==
Although the Netherlandish artists are primarily known for their panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved [[retable]]s, [[stained glass]], brass objects and carved [[tomb]]s.&lt;ref name="sn87"&gt;Nash (2008), 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Susie Nash]], by the early 16th century, the region led the field in almost every aspect of portable visual culture, "with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them".&lt;ref name="sn87" /&gt; The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and [[metalwork]], which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"&gt;Campbell (1976) 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's [[commons:File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of Charles the Bold - WGA25709.jpg|portrait]] of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck's lost ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|Portrait of Isabella of Portugal]]''.&lt;ref name ="Ainsworth24"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt; Artists often worked in more than one medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo (1993), 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleland (2002), i–ix&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, the conventions of [[donor portrait]]s, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'' and van der Weyden's ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of [[landscape art|landscape painting]] as a separate genre.&lt;ref name="Jones 2011 30"&gt;Jones (2011), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminated manuscript===
[[File:Girart de Roussillon (full page).jpg|thumb|320|Master of Girart de Roussillon, c.&amp;nbsp;1450, Burgundian wedding (Philip the Good and Isabella of Portugal). [[Austrian National Library]], Vienna]]
Before the mid-15th century, illuminated books were considered a higher form of art than panel painting, and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth, status and taste of their owners.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Harbison (1995), 47&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts were ideally suited as [[diplomatic gift]]s or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 27&lt;/ref&gt; From the 12th century, specialist monastery-based workshops (in French ''libraires'') produced [[books of hours]] (collections of prayers to be said at [[canonical hours]]), [[psalter]]s, prayer books and histories, as well as romance and poetry books. At the start of the 15th century, Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to "include as many pictures as they could afford", which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of [[indulgence]]. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer,&lt;ref name="w233"&gt;Wieck (1996), 233&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in Christus' 1450–60 panel ''Portrait of a Young Man'', now in the [[National Gallery]], which shows a small leaf with text to the ''[[Veil of Veronica|Vera icon]]'' illustrated with the head of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/petrus-christus-portrait-of-a-young-man Portrait of a Young Man]". ''[[National Gallery]]'', London. Retrieved 4 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and [[Utrecht]]. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists.&lt;ref name="w233" /&gt;

The [[Limbourg brothers]]'s ornate ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' perhaps marks both the beginning and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the [[Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy]] explored the same mix of illusionism and realism.&lt;ref name="Harbison29"/&gt; The Limbourgs' career ended just as van Eyck's began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry were dead, most likely from [[Black death|plague]].&lt;ref name="Harbison29" /&gt; Van Eyck is thought to have contributed several of the more acclaimed [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G.&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 83&lt;/ref&gt; A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David, though it is unclear whether they are from his hands or those of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of [[Liturgical book|liturgical texts]].&lt;ref name="w233"&gt;Wieck (1996), 233&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death.&lt;ref name="Metmanuscripts"&gt;Jones, Susan. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/manu/hd_manu.htm "Manuscript Illumination in Northern Europe"]. ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art''. Retrieved 11 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Kren, Philip's "library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety".&lt;ref name="k8"/&gt; Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and [[Margaret of York]]; his granddaughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]; and to his son-in-law, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] and the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|English Royal Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 20–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, [[James IV of Scotland]] and [[Eleanor of Viseu]].&lt;ref name="sn93"&gt;Nash (2008), 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Folio 153r - The Death of Christ.jpg|thumb|140|Limbourg brothers, ''The Death of Christ'', folio 153r, [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].]]
There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination; van Eyck, van der Weyden, Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures. In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin's work was often used as a source in this way, for example in the "Hours of Raoul d'Ailly".&lt;ref name="nash428"&gt;Nash (1995), 428&lt;/ref&gt; Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women.&lt;ref name="w233" /&gt; The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost.&lt;ref name="k8"&gt;Kren (2010), 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt;

Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text.&lt;ref name="sn923"&gt;Nash (2008), 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Hours of Mary of Burgundy|Nassau book of hours]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1467–80) by the [[Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy]], in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] (possibly [[Gerard Horenbout]]),&lt;ref name="sn94"&gt;Nash (2008), 94&lt;/ref&gt; known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.&lt;ref name="Harbison29"&gt;Harbison (1995), 29&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 19th century, the collection of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as [[William Young Ottley]], leading to the destruction of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Wieck (1996), 234–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapestry===
[[File:The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn, fragment (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|"The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn", fragment from ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'', 1495–1505. [[The Cloisters]], New York]]

During the mid-15th century, [[tapestry]] was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of [[Arras]], Bruges and [[Tournai]]. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, [[Pope Julius II]] sent [[Raphael]]'s [[Raphael Cartoons|cartoons]] to Brussels to be woven into hangings.&lt;ref name="n88"&gt;Nash (2008), 88&lt;/ref&gt; Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the [[Congress of Arras]] in 1435,&lt;ref name="sn87" /&gt; where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (''tout autour'') with tapestries showing scenes of the "Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege".&lt;ref name = "Freeman1"/&gt; At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room "was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from ''[[Roman de la Rose|The Romance of the Rose]]''.&lt;ref name = "Freeman1"&gt;Freeman (1973), 1&lt;/ref&gt; For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced "innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen".&lt;ref&gt;Phillip (1947), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies.&lt;ref name="n264"&gt;Nash (2008), 264&lt;/ref&gt; Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories, in which they are typically found at the top of the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. [[Charles V of France]] had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean de Berry]] owned 19, while [[Mary of Burgundy]], [[Isabella of Valois]], [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.&lt;ref name="n266"&gt;Nash (2008), 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapestry production began with design.&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"&gt;Cavallo (1973), 21&lt;/ref&gt; The designs, or [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoons]] were typically executed on paper or parchment, put together by qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive.&lt;ref name="n209"&gt;Nash (2008), 209&lt;/ref&gt; Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, in most of the towns and in many of the villages.&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"/&gt;

[[File:Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ.jpg|thumb|513px|Unknown Flemish weaver, ''Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ'', c.&amp;nbsp;1470–90. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam]]
Looms were not controlled by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo (1973), 12&lt;/ref&gt; The entrepreneur was in direct contact with the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by [[Colart de Laon]]&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"/&gt; having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.&lt;ref name="n209" /&gt;

Because tapestries were designed largely by painters, their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting. This is especially true with the later generations of 16th-century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell. Harbison describes how the intricate, dense and overlaid detail of Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' resembles, "in its precise symbolism&amp;nbsp;... a medieval tapestry".&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triptychs and altarpieces===
Northern [[triptych]]s{{efn-ua|The word ''triptych'' did not exist during the era; the works were known as "paintings with doors". See Jacobs (2011), 8}} and [[polyptych]]s were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for [[liturgy|liturgical]] settings.&lt;ref name="j1009"&gt;Jacobs (2000), 1009&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.{{efn-ua|In 14th-century altarpieces the "nature of the subject" was most important; generally the more sacred the subject the more decorative and elaborate its treatment. See Huizinga (2009), 22}}&lt;ref name="b35" /&gt;

[[File:The Braque Triptych interior.jpg|thumb|560px|left|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Braque Triptych]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1452. Oil on oak panels. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris. This triptych is noted for the floating "speech" inscriptions, and for the landscape uniting the panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 89&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels.&lt;ref name="t319"&gt;Toman (2011), 319&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.{{efn-ua|The work comprises 12 exterior and 14 interior painted panels, and the different possible combinations of panels produced different intended meanings. See Toman (2011), 319}}&lt;ref name="t319" /&gt;

The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2011), 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated by members of the [[Holy Family]]; early works, especially from the [[Siena|Sienese]] or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures.&lt;ref name="b116"&gt;Blum (1972), 116&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and c.&amp;nbsp;1452 ''[[Braque Triptych]]''. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels.&lt;ref&gt;Acres (2000), 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs,{{efn-ua|Of which three are documented but lost, eight survive fully intact, and five exist in fragments. See Jacobs (2000), 1010}} the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.&lt;ref name="j1009" /&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - Hermit Saints Triptych.jpg|thumb|480px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Hermit Saints]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1493. [[Doge's Palace, Venice]]]]

Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400.&lt;ref name="b35" /&gt; Few of these very early examples survive,&lt;ref name="Borchert 2011, 35"&gt;Borchert (2011), 35&lt;/ref&gt; but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. [[Till-Holger Borchert]] describes how they bestowed a "prestige which, in the first half of the 15th century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving".&lt;ref name="B52"&gt;Borchert (2011), 52&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels' altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of [[division of labour]].&lt;ref name="B52"/&gt;

Multi-panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid-16th century. Later the [[iconoclasm]] of the Reformation deemed them offensive,&lt;ref name="c405"/&gt; and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name="b35"/&gt; As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings".&lt;ref name="c405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diptychs===
[[Diptych]]s were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame);&lt;ref name="p100"&gt;Pearson (2000), 100&lt;/ref&gt; the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; Originating from conventions in [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]], diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces.&lt;ref name="s144"&gt;Smith (2004), 144&lt;/ref&gt; Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side.&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"&gt;Smith (2004), 134&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval "treasury art" -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The [[tracery]] seen in works such as van der Weyden's ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child]]'' reflects ivory carving of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2006), 175&lt;/ref&gt; The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]],&lt;ref name="p99"&gt;Pearson (2000), 99&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by [[Hugo van der Goes]], Hans Memling and later [[Jan van Scorel]].&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"/&gt;

[[File:Seguace di dirck bouts, dittico con mater dolorosa e cristo coronato di spine, 1450-1500 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Dieric Bouts]], ''[[Mater Dolorosa]]/[[Ecce Homo]]'', after 1450, a rare surviving diptych with intact frame and hinges]]
Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child,&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 178&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion.&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt; The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"/&gt; – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the "place of honour" alongside the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Hulin de Loo (1923), 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the [[Devotio Moderna]] movement – grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany.&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt; Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a "matter of small scale and meticulous detail". The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the "experience of miraculous visions".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998c), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 20th-century technical examination has shown significant differences in technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies may be the result of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.&lt;ref name="H16"&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Few intact diptychs survive. As with altarpieces, the majority were later separated and sold as single "genre" pictures.&lt;ref name="c405"/&gt; In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many diptychs were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.&lt;ref name="Borchert182ff"&gt;Borchert (2006), 182–185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraiture===
[[File:Hugo van der Goes 007.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Hugo van der Goes]], ''Portrait of a Man'', c.&amp;nbsp;1480. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]

Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga (2009 ed.), 225&lt;/ref&gt; While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed.&lt;ref name ="Ainsworth24"/&gt; Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer;&lt;ref&gt;Bauman (1986), 4&lt;/ref&gt; his seminal 1432 ''[[Léal Souvenir]]'' is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance.&lt;ref name = "Kemperdick19"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 19&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' is filled with symbolism,&lt;ref name ="Dhanens198"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 198&lt;/ref&gt; as is the ''Madonna of Chancelor Rolin'', commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.&lt;ref name ="Dhanens269"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Petrus Christus - Portrait of a Young Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Petrus Christus]], ''[[Portrait of a Young Girl (Christus)|Portrait of a Young Girl]]'', after 1460, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. One of the first portraits to present its sitter in a three-dimensional room. Many sources mention her enigmatic and complex expression, and petulant, reserved gaze.&lt;ref name="VDE69"&gt;Van der Elst (1944), 69&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 104–107&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1462 ''[[:commons:File:Bouts Portrait of a Man 1462.jpg|Portrait of a Man]]'', Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 23&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in [[fresco]] and illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="k26"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 26&lt;/ref&gt; Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power.&lt;ref name="k28" /&gt; Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]'s positioning of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' in front of a landscape view.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist [[Jean Fouquet]] and the Germans [[Hans Pleydenwurff]]&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 25&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Schongauer among others.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 277–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian [[Quattrocento]] – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer.&lt;ref name ="Smith96"/&gt; The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's 1433 ''[[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|Portrait of a Man]]'' is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer.&lt;ref name ="Smith96"&gt;Smith (2004), 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential [[betrothal]]s, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer described the function of portraiture as "preserving a person's appearance after his death".&lt;ref&gt;''Awch behelt daz gemell dy gestalt der menschen nach jrem sterben'' See Rupprich, Hans (ed). "Dürer". ''Schriftlicher Nachlass'', Volume 3. Berlin, 1966. 9&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Dürer's father, a goldsmith, spent time as a journeyman in the Netherlands and met with, according to his son, "the great artists". Dürer himself travelled there between 1520 and 1521 and visited Bruges, Ghent and Brussels among other places. See Borchert (2011), 83}} Portraits were objects of status, and served to ensure that the individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 95&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people than at any time since the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being [[:commons:File:Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati - Google Art Project.jpg|van Eyck's study]] for his ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]''.&lt;ref name="k28"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape===

Christ and thief before a view of Jerusalem, c.&amp;nbsp;1430. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. The Crucifixion panel in this diptych is framed within an azure sky against a distant view of [[Jerusalem]].]]
Landscape was a secondary concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]]. They were rarely based on actual locations;{{efn-ua|[[Konrad Witz]]'s ''[[The Miraculous Draft of Fishes (Witz)|Miraculous Draft of Fishes]]'' of 1444 is credited as the earliest extant faithful portrayal in European art history of a landscape based on observation of real topographical features. See Borchert (2011), 58}} the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes.&lt;ref name="h134"&gt;Harbison (1995), 134&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.&amp;nbsp;1430 ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]'' and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]''.&lt;ref name="Jones 2011 30"/&gt;

Van Eyck was almost certainly influenced by the [[Labours of the Months]] landscapes the Limbourg brothers painted for the ''Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry''. The influence can be seen in the illuminations painted in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]], which show rich landscapes in the tiny ''bas de page'' scenes.&lt;ref name ="Pächt29"&gt;Pächt (1999), 29&lt;/ref&gt; These, according to Pächt, should be defined as early examples of Netherlandish landscape painting.&lt;ref name ="Pächt187"&gt;Pächt (1999), 187&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape tradition in illuminated manuscripts would continue for at least the next century. [[Simon Bening]] "explored new territory in the genre of landscape", seen in several of the leaves he painted for the c. 1520 ''[[Grimani|Grimani Breviary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 392&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 15th century, a number of painters emphasised landscape in their works, a development led in part by the shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects.&lt;ref name="h60" /&gt; Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably [[Konrad Witz]] in the mid-15th century, and later [[Joachim Patinir]].&lt;ref name="h61"&gt;Harbison (1995), 61&lt;/ref&gt; Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from [[Haarlem]], [[Leiden]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.&lt;ref name="h134" /&gt;

Patinir developed what is now called the [[world landscape]] genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1993), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt; The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the [[Danube school]]. Patinir's works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1993), 47&lt;/ref&gt; World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a [[long shot|long]] rather than a [[medium shot]]. The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere [[staffage]]. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1986), 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular subjects of this type include the [[Flight into Egypt]] and the plight of hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]]. As well as connecting the style to the later [[Age of Discovery]], the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1986), 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Italian Renaissance==
[[File:Hugo van der Goes - Triptyque Portinari, détail 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hugo van der Goes]], detail from the ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1475. [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
The progressions in northern art developed almost simultaneously with the early [[Italian Renaissance]]. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, to the extent that many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north.&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"&gt;Toman (2011), 317&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, as can be seen in the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks.&lt;ref name="H3"&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 3&lt;/ref&gt; The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition,&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"/&gt; and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 40&lt;/ref&gt;

While devotional paintings – especially altarpieces – remained dominant in Early Netherlandish art,&lt;ref name="Toman, 317" /&gt; secular portraiture became increasingly common in both northern and southern Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Toman (2011), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian influences on Netherlandish art are first apparent in the late 15th century, when some of the painters began to travel south. This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, "picturesque gables, bloated, barrel-shaped columns, droll cartouches, 'twisted' figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours – actually employ[ing] the visual language of Mannerism".&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"/&gt; Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result, painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.&lt;ref name="C20"&gt;Campbell (1998), 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Memling 061.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Hans Memling, ''Virgin and Child with Two Angels'', c. 1480. [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
The northern masters were greatly admired in Italy. According to Friedländer they exercised a strong influence over 15th-century Italian artists, a view Panofsky agrees with.&lt;ref&gt;Deam (1998), 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; However, Italian painters began to move beyond Netherlandish influences by the 1460s, as they concentrated on composition with a greater emphasis on harmony of parts belonging together – "that elegant harmony and grace&amp;nbsp;... which is called beauty", evident, for example, in [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[:File:Andrea Mantegna - The Dead Christ.jpg|Entombment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 53&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 16th century, the reputation of the northern masters was such that there was an established north-south trade in their works, although many of the paintings or objects sent south were by lesser artists and of lower quality.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 35&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations introduced in the north and adopted in Italy included the setting of figures in domestic interiors and the viewing of interiors from multiple vantage points, through openings such as doors or windows.{{efn-ua|Described by Panofsky as "the interior viewed through a triple arcade".  See Panofsky (1969), 142}}&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 142–3&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', in Florence's [[Uffizi]], played an important role in introducing Florentine painters to trends from the north, and artists like [[Giovanni Bellini]] came under the influence of northern painters working in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Memling successfully merged the two styles, exemplified in his ''Virgin and Child with Two Angels''. By the mid-16th-century, however, Netherlandish art was seen as crude; [[Michelangelo]] claimed it was appealing only to "monks and friars".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 58&lt;/ref&gt; At this point northern art began to fall almost completely out of favour in Italy. By the 17th century, when Bruges had lost its prestige and position as the pre-eminent European trading city (the rivers silted and ports were forced to close), the Italians dominated European art.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 53–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction and dispersal==

===Iconoclasm===
[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|330px|Print of the destruction in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], the "signature event" of the [[Beeldenstorm]], August 20, 1566, by [[Frans Hogenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;analysed in Arnade, 146 (quoted); see also [http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/155/index.html Art through time]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Religious images came under close scrutiny as actually or potentially [[idolatrous]] from the start of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. [[Martin Luther]] accepted some imagery, but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria. [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] were wholly opposed to public religious images, above all in churches, and [[Calvinism]] soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism. From 1520, outbursts of reformist [[iconoclasm]] broke out across much of Northern Europe.&lt;ref name="sn15"&gt;Nash (2008), 15&lt;/ref&gt; These might be official and peaceable, as in England under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]] and the [[English Commonwealth]], or unofficial and often violent, as in the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' or "Iconoclastic Fury" in 1566 in the Netherlands.  On 19 August 1566, this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent, where [[Marcus van Vaernewijck]]  chronicled the events. He wrote of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' being "taken to pieces and lifted, panel by panel, into the tower to preserve it from the rioters".&lt;ref&gt;Van Vaernewijck (1905–6), 132&lt;/ref&gt;  Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566,&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 133–148&lt;/ref&gt; followed by more losses in the Spanish [[Sack of Antwerp]] in 1576, and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581, which now included city and guild buildings, when Calvinists controlled the city council.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thousands of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes,&lt;ref name="sn14"&gt;Nash (2008), 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the survival rate of works by the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, but there are still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the period's artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches,&lt;ref name="Borchert 2011, 35"/&gt; with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck's ''Madonna in the Church'' and van der Weyden's ''[[commons:File:Rogier van der Weyden and workshop - Exhumation of St Hubert NG 783.jpg|Exhumation of St Hubert]]''.  According to Nash, van der Weyden's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches, and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, "any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes". Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time.&lt;ref name="sn14" /&gt; Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden's ''[[The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald]]'' polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the ''Ghent Altarpiece''. It was destroyed by French artillery during the [[bombardment of Brussels]] in 1695, and is today known only from a tapestry copy.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===
There have been significant challenges for art historians in establishing the names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only as a result of decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "n21"&gt;Nash (2008), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Some painters, such as [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]] and [[Ambrosius Benson]] of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.&lt;ref name="A36"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The avenues for research have been limited by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and a great number of works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed.&lt;ref name = "n21"/&gt; The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded.&lt;ref name="n22"&gt;Nash (2008), 22&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s,&lt;ref name="n123"&gt;Nash (2008), 123&lt;/ref&gt; and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them.&lt;ref name="n44"&gt;Nash (2008), 44&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.&lt;ref name="n39"&gt;Nash (2008), 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Jan van Eyck's life is well documented in comparison to his contemporary painters, and because he was so clearly the period's innovator, a great number of works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Today Jan is credited with about 26–28 extant works. This reduced number in part follows from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling,&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 8&lt;/ref&gt; while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by "names of convenience", usually of the "Master of&amp;nbsp;..." format. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the "notname" term is often used, a derivative of a German term.{{efn-ua|Typically pseudonyms are applied after common elements are established among a group of works. Art historians consider similarities of theme, style, iconography, biblical source and physical location before attributing work to an individual or workshop, then assign a generic name.}} Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences.&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt; Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, as in the case of Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Flémalle.&lt;ref name="Pächt9716"&gt;Pächt (1997), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Many unidentified late-14th- and early-15th-century northern artists were of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect because they have not been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, "much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied".&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt; Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities of a number of well-known artists have been founded on the basis of a single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called [[Master of the Legend of the Magdalen]], who may have been [[Pieter van Coninxloo]], is one of the more notable examples;&lt;ref name="Campbell114"/&gt; others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of surviving theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion from any of the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by [[Lucas de Heere]] in 1565 and [[Karel van Mander]] in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriacus Ancona]] in 1449, [[Bartolomeo Facio]] in 1456, and [[Giovanni Santi]] in 1482.&lt;ref name="sn24"&gt;Nash (2008), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
The dominance of Northern [[Mannerism]] in the mid-16th century was built on a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of repute was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended to be on the Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht Dürer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c.&amp;nbsp;1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region's painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 411–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlandish painters were largely forgotten in the 18th century. When [[The Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] was converted to an art gallery during the [[French Revolution]], Gerard David's ''Marriage at Cana'' – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels were added to the collection after the French [[Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars|conquered the Low Countries]].{{efn-ua|The central panels of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', van Eyck's ''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'', and Memling's ''Morel Triptych''}} These works had a profound effect on German literary critic and philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Karl Schlegel]], who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to [[Ludwig Tieck]], who had the piece published in 1805.&lt;ref name="chapuis 4ff"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The marriage at cana1 wga.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Gerard David, ''Marriage at Cana'', c.&amp;nbsp;1500. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris. This work was first publicly displayed in 1802, attributed to van Eyck. Art historians in the 19th century were preoccupied with the difficulties of attribution.]]

In 1821 [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] became interested in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings in the collection of the brothers [[Sulpiz Boisserée|Sulpiz]] and [[Melchior Boisserée]] in Heidelberg.{{efn-ua|The Boisserée collection was acquired in 1827, on the advice of [[Johann Georg von Dillis]], to form part of the nucleus of the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich. See Ridderbos (2005), 86}} Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), viii&lt;/ref&gt; She published ''Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger'' in 1822, the same year [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, ''Ueber Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck'';&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 219–224&lt;/ref&gt; Waagen's work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer's earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the ''Ghent'' panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.&lt;ref name="chapuis 4ff"/&gt;

In 1830 the [[Belgian Revolution]] split Belgium from the Netherlands of today; as the newly created state sought to establish a cultural identity, Memling's reputation came to equal that of van Eyck in the 19th century. Memling was seen as the older master's match technically, and as possessing a deeper emotional resonance.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 413–416&lt;/ref&gt;  When in 1848 the collection of Prince Ludwig of [[House of Oettingen-Wallerstein|Oettingen-Wallerstein]] at Schloss Wallerstein was forced onto the market, his cousin [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] arranged a viewing at [[Kensington Palace]]; though a catalogue of works attributed to the School of Cologne, Jan van Eyck and van der Weyden was compiled by Waagen, there were no other buyers so Albert purchased them himself.&lt;ref&gt;Steegman, John (1950). ''Consort of Taste'', excerpted in Frank Herrmann, ''The English as Collectors'', 240; Queen Victoria donated the best of them to the National Gallery after the Prince Consort's death.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collectors/prince-albert-and-the-gallery Prince Albert and the Gallery]". ''National Gallery'', London. Retrieved 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At a period when London's [[National Gallery]] sought to increase its prestige,&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] purchased Rogier van der Weyden's ''[[The Magdalen Reading]]'' panel in 1860 from Edmond Beaucousin's "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlandish art became popular with museum-goers in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, van Eyck and Memling were the most highly regarded, with van der Weyden and Christus little more than footnotes. Later many of the works then attributed to Memling were found to be from van der Weyden or his workshop. In 1902, Bruges hosted the first [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|exhibition of Netherlandish art]] with 35,000 visitors, an event that was a "turning point in the appreciation of early Netherlandish art".&lt;ref name="Ridderbos et al. (2005), 275"&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 5&lt;/ref&gt;  For a number of reasons, the chief of which was the difficulty of securing paintings for the exhibition, only a few of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's panels were displayed, while almost 40 of Memling's pieces were shown. Nevertheless, van Eyck and van der Weyden, to an extent, were then considered the first rank of Netherlandish artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruges exhibition renewed interest in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. [[Johan Huizinga]] was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 284&lt;/ref&gt; Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship and conservation==
[[File:Ghent altarpiece at Altaussee.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' during recovery from the [[Altaussee]] salt mine at the end of World War II. The pioneering [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] work on these panels in the 1950s led to advances in methodology and technical application&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13" /&gt;]]
The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]]'s pioneering ''Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts''. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian renaissance]].&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gent-CatedralStBavon-Poliptic-vanEyck-1765sh.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''Ghent Altarpiece'' during technical analysis in [[Saint Bavo's Cathedral]]]]
Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon [[Formalism (art)|formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Holly (1985), 9&lt;/ref&gt; He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography.&lt;ref name="r248" /&gt; Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="k177"&gt;Kren (2010), 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Pächt and [[Friedrich Winkler]] continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience.&lt;ref name="k177" /&gt; The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and [[Meyer Schapiro]], that the attributions generally accepted today were established.&lt;ref name="Campbell114"&gt;Campbell (1998), 114&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In the 1960s and 1970s [[Lotte Brand Philip]] and [[Elisabeth Dhanens]] built on Panofsky's work, and resolved many of the issues that Panofsky had struggled with, especially in relation to identifying the sources of iconography, and attributing works of the early to mid-15th century.}}

More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters.&lt;ref name="Umass"/&gt; The conservation of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13"/&gt;

Scholarship since the 1970s has tended to move away from a pure study of iconography, instead emphasizing the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time.&lt;ref name="Umass"&gt;"[http://www.umass.edu/arthist/harbison.htm Craig Harbison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605061635/http://www.umass.edu/arthist/harbison.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}".

"[http://www.umass.edu/chronicle/archives/00/04-14/harbison28.html A Picture Worth Many Thousand Words]". ''Chronicle'', University of Massachusetts, 14 April 2000. Retrieved 15 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a "prayer book mentality" available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27829">{{short description|The hypothesis that, in the course of evolution, some entirely new properties, such as mind and consciousness, appear at certain critical points}}
'''Emergent evolution''' was the [[hypothesis]] that, in the course of [[evolution]], some entirely new properties, such as mind and [[consciousness]], appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The term was originated by the psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 140-142, pp. 376-384. {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis was widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in [[teleology]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Brian P. (1992). ''The Rise and Fall of British Emergentism''. In A. Beckerman, H. Flohr, and J. Kim, eds., ''Emergence or Reduction? Essays on the Prospects of Nonreductive Physicalism''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. pp. 49–93. {{ISBN|3-11-012880-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Charles A. (1929). ''The Philosophic Functions of Emergence''. ''[[The Philosophical Review]]''. Vol. 38, No. 4. pp. 372-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The term ''[[emergence|emergent]]'' was first used to describe the concept by [[George Lewes]] in volume two of his 1875 book ''Problems of Life and Mind'' (p.&amp;nbsp;412).  [[Henri Bergson]] covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' on the [[Élan vital]].  Emergence was further developed by [[Samuel Alexander]] in his [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] during 1916–18 and published as ''Space, Time, and Deity'' (1920).  The related term ''emergent evolution'' was coined by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and published as ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of [[Roy Wood Sellars]]'s ''Evolutionary Naturalism'' (1922).

== Origins ==

=== Response to Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' ===

[[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s presentation of [[natural selection]], coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert G.B.|title=Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262182572|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism of [[natural selection]] described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time.

{{quote|Darwin knew that nature had to produce variations before natural selection could act …The problem had been caught by other evolutionists almost as soon as ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was first published. [[Sir Charles Lyell]] saw it clearly in 1860 before he even became an evolutionist…(Reid, p.3)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

[[St. George Jackson Mivart|St. George Jackson Mivart's]] ''On the Genesis of Species'' (1872) and [[Edward Drinker Cope|Edward Cope]]'s ''Origin of the Fittest'' (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. [[William Bateson]] in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (''Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species'').&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

=== Wallace's further thoughts ===

Wallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, ''Darwinism'', was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it.

{{quote|the most prominent feature is that I enter into popular yet critical examination of those underlying fundamental problems which Darwin purposely excluded from his works as being beyond the scope of his enquiry. Such are the nature and cause of Life itself, and more especially of its most fundamental and mysterious powers - growth and reproduction ...

Darwin always ... adduced the "laws of Growth with Reproduction," and of "Inheritance with Variability," as being fundamental facts of nature, without which Natural Selection would be powerless or even non-existent ...

... even if it were proved to be an exact representation of the facts, it would not be an explanation... because it would not account for the forces, the directive agency, and the organising power which are essential features of growth …&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Theory of Life|year=1911|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_of_life.html?id=M6UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In examining this aspect, excluded ''ab initio'' by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that ''Life'' itself cannot be understood except by means of a theory that includes "an organising and directive Life-Principle." These necessarily involve a "Creative Power", a "directive Mind" and finally "an ultimate Purpose" (the development of Man). It supports the view of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] that "life is the cause, not the consequence" of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and when it infuses matter, forms living matter (protoplasm).

{{quote|a very well-founded doctrine, and one which was often advocated by John Hunter, that life is the cause and not the consequence of organisation ... if so, life must be antecedent to organisation, and can only be conceived as indissolubly connected with spirit and with thought, and with the cause of the directive energy everywhere manifested in the growth of living things ... endowed with the mysterious organising power we term life ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}
Wallace then refers to the operation of another power called "mind" that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter:

{{quote|evidence of a foreseeing mind which...so directed and organised that life, in all its myriad forms, as, in the far-off future, to provide all that was most essential for the growth and development of man's spiritual nature ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

Proceeding from Hunter's view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of [[consciousness]], which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.

{{quote|If, as John Hunter, T.H. Huxley, and other eminent thinkers have declared, "life is the cause, not the consequence, of organisation," so we may believe that mind is the cause, not the consequence, of brain development.

... So there are undoubtedly different degrees and probably also different kinds of mind in various grades of animal life&amp;nbsp;... And&amp;nbsp;... so the mind-giver&amp;nbsp;... enables each class or order of animals to obtain the amount of mind requisite for its place in nature&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

== Emergent evolution ==

=== Early roots ===
The issue of how change in nature 'emerged' can be found in classical Greek thought -  order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity. [[Aristotle]] spoke of wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist [[Galen]] also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Hegel]] spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to [[John Stuart Mill]] (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72]&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

The idea of an emergent quality that was something new in nature was further taken up by [[George Henry Lewes]] (1874–1875), who again noted, as with Galen earlier, that these evolutionary "emergent" qualities are distinguishable from adaptive, additive "resultants." [[Henry Drummond (evangelist)|Henry Drummond]] in ''The Descent of Man'' (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to the inertial inorganic realm.

{{quote|When we pass from the inorganic to the organic we come upon a new set of laws - but the reason why the lower set do not seem to operate in the higher sphere is not that they are annhilated, but that they are overruled. (Drummond 1883, p. 405, quoted in Reid)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

As Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p.&amp;nbsp;73)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Samuel Alexander]] took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):

{{quote|If we turn reductionism on its head we add levels. More carefully, we add new laws that satisfy the constraints imposed by laws already in place. Moreover these new laws apply to complex phenomena that are consequences of the original laws; they are at a new level.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=John|title=Emergence. From Chaos to Order|year=1998|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== C. Lloyd Morgan and emergent evolution ===
Another major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], a zoologist and student of [[T.H. Huxley]], who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of [[Saltation (biology)|saltation]] but was best regarded as "a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point."(quoted in Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;73-74)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the  continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read [[anthropomorphism]] into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon:
 
{{quote|In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.|Morgan, 1894, p. 53}}
However, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his ''An Introduction to Comparative Psychology'' (1903):

{{quote|To this, however, it should be added, lest the range of the principle be misunderstood, that the canon by no means excludes the interpretation of a particular activity in terms of the higher processes, if we already have independent evidence of the occurrence of these higher processes in the animal under observation.|Morgan, 1903, p. 59}}

As Reid observes,

{{quote|While the so-called historiographical "rehabilitation of the canon" has been underway for some time now, Morgan's emergent evolutionist position (which was the highest expression of his attempt to place the study of mind back into such a "wider" natural history) is seldom mentioned in more than passing terms even within contemporary history of psychology textbooks.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

Morgan also fought against the [[Behaviorism|behaviorist school]] and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution:

{{quote|An influential school of 'behaviorists' roundly deny that mental relations, if such there be, are in any sense or in any manner effective... My message is that one may speak of mental relations as effective no less 'scientifically' than... physical relations...|Morgan, 1930, p. 72}}

His ''Animal Conduct'' (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three "grades" or "levels of mentality" which he labeled: 'percipient, perceptive, and reflective.' (p.&amp;nbsp;42)

=== Alexander and the emergence of mind ===

Morgan's idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don’t. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Samuel|title=Space, Time and Deity|year=1916–18|publisher=Gifford Lectures|location=Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Deity.html?id=v70tAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And mental process is also "something new, "a fresh creation", which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

At the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, a new "thing" not reducible to its initial neural parts.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new “complexities of motion” in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior “complexities of motion” but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, “complexes of motion.” Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of “body” (lower order) and an element of “mind” (higher order), or “the conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.”

Mind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level.

{{quote|Life is not an epiphenomenon of matter but an emergent from it&amp;nbsp;... The new character or quality which the vital physico-chemical complex possesses stands to it as soul or mind to the neural basis.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the "directing agency" or entelechy is found "in the principle or plan".

{{quote|a given stage of material complexity is characterised by such and such special features…By accepting this we at any rate confine ourselves to noting the facts…and do not invent entities for which there seems to be no other justification than that something is done in life which is not done in matter.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

While an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it.
 
{{quote|Ascent takes place, it would seem, through complexity.[increasing order] But at each change of quality the complexity as it were gathers itself together and is expressed in a new simplicity.
Within a given level of emergence, there are degrees of development.
 
... There are on one level degrees of perfection or development; and at the same time there is affinity by descent between the existents belonging to the level. This difference of perfection is not the same thing as difference of order or rank such as subsists between matter and life or life and mind ...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

The concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the “mind” of motion, materialising is the “mind” of matter, living the “mind” of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter “materialising” (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life “living” (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind “minding” (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity.

{{quote|let us describe the empirical quality of any kind of finite which performs to it the office of consciousness or mind as its 'mind.' Yet at the same time let us remember that the 'mind' of a living thing is not conscious mind but is life, and has not the empirical character of consciousness at all, and that life is not merely a lower degree of mind or consciousness, but something different. We are using 'mind' metaphorically by transference from real minds and applying it to the finites on each level in virtue of their distinctive quality; down to Space-Time itself whose existent complexes of bare space-time have for their mind bare time in its empirical variations.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Alexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being “out there” in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.

{{quote|There is no consciousness lodged, as I have supposed, in the organism as a quality of the neural response; consciousness belongs to the totality of objects, of what are commonly called the objects of consciousness or the field of consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Consciousness is therefore "out there" where the objects are, by a new version of Berkleyanism&amp;nbsp;... Obviously for this doctrine as for mine there is no mental object as distinct from a physical object: the image of a tree is a tree in an appropriate form...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Because of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it.
 
{{quote|In being conscious of its own space and time, the mind is conscious of the space and time of external things and vice versa. This is a direct consequence of the continuity of Space-Time in virtue of which any point-instant is connected sooner or later, directly or indirectly, with every other...

The mind therefore does not apprehend the space of its objects, that is their shape, size and locality, by sensation, for it depends for its character on mere spatio-temporal conditions, though it is not to be had as consciousness in the absence of sensation (or else of course ideation). It is clear without repeating these considerations that the same proposition is true of Time; and of motion&amp;nbsp;... I shall call this mode of apprehension in its distinction from sensation, intuition.&amp;nbsp;... Intuition is different from reason, but reason and sense alike are outgrowths from it, empirical determinations of it...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

In a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is “enjoyed” (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated.

{{quote|The universe for Alexander is essentially in process, with Time as its ongoing aspect, and the ongoing process consists in the formation of changing complexes of motions. These complexes become ordered in repeatable ways displaying what he calls "qualities." There is a hierarchy of kinds of organized patterns of motions, in which each level depends on the subvening level, but also displays qualities not shown at the subvening level nor predictable from it… On this there sometimes supervenes a further level with the quality called "life"; and certain subtle syntheses which carry life are the foundation for a further level with a new quality. "mind." This is the highest level known to us, but not necessarily the highest possible level. The universe has a forward thrust, called its "nisus" (broadly to be identified with the Time aspect) in virtue of which further levels are to be expected...&lt;ref name=Emmet&gt;{{cite web|last=Emmet |first=Dorothy |title=Whitehead and Alexander |url=http://www.religion-online/showarticle.asp?title=2834 |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Robert G. B. Reid===

Emergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid, a biology professor at the [[University of Victoria]]. In his book ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis'' (1985), he stated that the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] with its emphasis on [[natural selection]] is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Mary B. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''. Vol. 61, No. 2, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, John F. (1987). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Vol. 20, No. 3. pp. 424-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an "obsolete conceptual framework", provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a [[Orthogenesis|teleological process of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. [[Isis (journal)|Isis]]. Vol. 77, No. 2, pp. 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid later published the book ''Biological Emergences'' (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christopher S. (2008). ''Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Integrative and Comparative Biology]]''. Vol. 48, No. 6. pp. 871-873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biological-emergences "Biological Emergences"]. [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Massimo Pigliucci]] "Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims." Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pigliucci, Massimo. (2009). [http://philpapers.org/archive/MASDWN/ "Down with Natural Selection?"] ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]''. 52: 134-140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that "the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;Badyaev, Alexander V. (2008). ''Evolution Despite Natural Selection? Emergence Theory and the Ever Elusive Link Between Adaptation and Adaptability''. ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 56: 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticized Reid's unorthodox views on emergence and evolution. Biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid's "presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date."&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, Samuel M. (2004). ''The Metamorphosis of Evo-Devo''. ''[[BioScience]]''. Vol. 54, No. 12.  pp. 1150-1151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Encyclopedia of Life''' ('''EOL''') is a free, online collaborative encyclopedia intended to document all of the 1.9 million [[Life|living]] [[species]] known to science. It is compiled from existing databases and from contributions by experts and non-experts throughout the world.&lt;ref name="EOL_Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/the_history_of_eol |title=EOL History |publisher=Eol.org |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to build one "infinitely expandable" page for each species, including video, sound, images, graphics, as well as text.&lt;ref name="odling-smee2007"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070508/full/070508-7.html | title=Encyclopedia of Life launched | accessdate=2007-05-09 | last=Odling-Smee | first=Lucy | date=2007-05-09 | work=Nature | doi=10.1038/news070508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Encyclopedia incorporates content from the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]], which digitizes millions of pages of printed literature from the world's major natural history libraries. The project was initially backed by a US$50 million funding commitment, led by the [[MacArthur Foundation]] and the [[Sloan Foundation]], who provided US$20 million and US$5 million, respectively. The additional US$25 million came from five cornerstone institutions—the [[Field Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The project was initially led by Jim Edwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/22 |title=James Edwards - Encyclopedia of Life |publisher=Eol.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development team by [[David J. Patterson|David Patterson]]. Today, participating institutions and individual donors continue to support EOL through financial contributions.

==Overview==
EOL went live on 26 February 2008 with 30,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/science/26ency.html |title=The Encyclopedia of Life, No Bookshelf Required | work=The New York Times |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2008-02-27 |first=Carl |last=Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site immediately proved to be extremely popular, and temporarily had to revert to demonstration pages for two days when over 11 million views of it were requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Life Encyclopedia Debut Too Popular to Stay "Live" | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080227-AP-encyclopedi.html  | work=National Geographic | date=February 27, 2008 | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site relaunched on 5 September 2011 with a redesigned interface and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/sept_5 |title=New Version of Encyclopedia of Life Now Available – Encyclopedia of Life |publisher=Eol.org |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version – referred to as EOLv2 – was developed in response to requests from the general public, citizen scientists, educators and professional biologists for a site that was more engaging, accessible and personal. EOLv2 is redesigned to enhance usability and encourage contributions and interactions among users. It is also internationalized with interfaces provided for [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language speakers. On 16 January 2014, EOL launched TraitBank, a searchable, open digital repository for organism traits, measurements, interactions and other facts for all taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/traitbank-practical-semantics-organism-attribute-data |title=TraitBank: Practical semantics for organism attribute data |publisher=Semantic-web-journal.net |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative's Executive Committee includes senior officers from the Atlas of Living Australia, the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] consortium, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], [[CONABIO]], [[Field Museum]], [[Harvard University]], the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] (Library of Alexandria), [[MacArthur Foundation]], [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Sloan Foundation]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6638017.stm | title=Scientists compile 'book of life' | accessdate=2007-05-09 | date=2007-05-09 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/meet_the_team#executive |title=Meet the Team: Executive Committee |publisher=EOL |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intention  ==
Information about many species is already available from a variety of sources, in particular about the [[megafauna]]. Gathering currently available data on all 1.9 million species will take about 10 years.&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Science-Sante/2007/05/09/001-encyclopedie-vie.shtml?ref=rss | title=Encyclopédie de la vie: Une arche de Noé virtuelle! | date=9 May 2007 | work=Radio-Canada | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|09}}, EOL had information on more than 700,000 species available, along with more than 600,000 photos and millions of pages of scanned literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/info/sept_5 |title=New Version of the Encyclopedia of Life Now Available |publisher=Eol.org |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative relies on indexing information compiled by other efforts, including the Sp2000 and [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System|ITIS]] [[Catalogue of Life]], [[Fishbase]] and the Assembling Tree of Life project of [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], AmphibiaWeb, Mushroom explorer, microscope, etc. The initial focus has been on living species but will later include extinct species. As the discovery of new species is expected to continue (currently at about 20,000 per year), the encyclopedia will continue to grow. As taxonomy finds new ways to include species discovered by molecular techniques, the rate of new additions will increase, particularly in respect to the microbial work of (eu)bacteria, archaebacteria and viruses.

EOL's goal is to serve as a resource for the general public, enthusiastic amateurs, educators, students and professional scientists from around the world.&lt;ref name="EOL_Hist"/&gt;

==Resources and collaborations==
The Encyclopedia of Life has content partners around the world who share information through the EOL platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/content_partners |title=EOL Content Partners |publisher=Eol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Wikipedia and [[Flickr]].

Its interface is translated at [[translatewiki.net]].

'''Film studies''' is an academic discipline that deals with various [[film theory|theoretical]], [[history of film|historical]], and [[film criticism|critical]] approaches to [[film]]s.  It is sometimes subsumed within [[media studies]] and is often compared to [[television studies]]. Film studies is less concerned with advancing proficiency in [[Filmmaking|film production]] than it is with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Richard. "Introduction." Film Studies: Critical Approaches. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2000. 1-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In searching for these social-ideological values, film studies takes a series of critical approaches for the analysis of production, theoretical framework, context, and creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sikov, Ed. "Introduction." Introduction pg.1-4. Film Studies: an Introduction. New York: Columbia UP, 2010. Print. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zbCK8ETCWzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=film+studies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BwjJTJG1GsH7lwef1Yn3Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the film studies discipline exists as one in which the teacher does not always assume the primary educator role; the featured film itself serves that function. Also, in studying film, possible careers include critic or production. [[Film theory]] often includes the study of conflicts between the aesthetics of visual Hollywood and the textual analysis of screenplay. Overall the study of film continues to grow, as does the industry on which it focuses. Academic journals publishing film studies work include ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', ''[[Screen (journal)|Screen]]'', ''[[Cinema Journal]]'', ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' and ''[[Journal of Film and Video]]''.

==History==
Film studies as an academic discipline emerged in the twentieth century, decades after [[History of film technology#First_motion_pictures|the invention of motion pictures]]. Not to be confused with the technical aspects of film production, film studies exists only with the creation of [[film theory]]—which approaches film critically as an art—and the writing of [[film historiography]]. Because the modern film became an invention and industry only in the late nineteenth century, a generation of film producers and [[Film director|directors]] existed significantly before the academic analysis that followed in later generations.

Early [[film school]]s focused on the production and subjective critique of film rather than on the critical approaches, history and theory used to study academically. Since the time film was created, the concept of film studies as a whole grew to analyze the formal aspects of film as they were created. Established in 1919 the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Moscow Film School]] was the first school in the world to focus on film. In the United States the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], established in 1929, was the first cinematic based school, which was created in agreement with the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. They were also the first to offer a major in film in 1932 but without the distinctions that are assumed in film studies. Universities began to implement different forms of cinema related curriculum without, however, the division between the abstract and practical approaches.

The ''Deutsche Filmakademie Babelsberg'' (i.e. German Film Academy Babelsberg) was founded in the Third Reich in 1938. Among the lecturers were e.g. [[Willi Forst]] and [[Heinrich George]]. To complete the studies at the Academy a student was expected to create his own film.

A movement away from [[Hollywood]] productions in the 1950s turned cinema into a more artistic [[independent films|independent]] endeavor. It was the creation of the [[auteur theory]], which asserted film as the director's vision and art, that prompted film studies to become truly considered academically worldwide in the 1960s. In 1965, film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], in his writings on [[Alfred Hitchcock]], declared that Hitchcock's films contained the same complexities of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Study in the Undergraduate Curriculum''. New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1983.15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jean Luc Godard]], a contributor to the influential magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinema]]'' wrote, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090651}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With stable enrollment, proper budgets and interest in all [[humanities]] numerous universities contained the ability to offer distinct film studies programs.

There were no individuals that created the criteria for film studies; rather the growing community of the [[film industry]] and academics began to criticize, document and analyze films, eventually conforming the concepts of film studies that pertain to artistic academia. With the success in first half of the twentieth century, prominent persons in the film industry could become an endowment source for schools focusing primarily on film, creating the location for film studies as a discipline to form. An example is [[George Lucas]]' US$175 million donation to the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,0,2054908,full.story?coll=la-home-right2 |title=LA's Screen Gems |first=Rachel |last=Abramowitz |authorlink= |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |year=2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124180156/http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,0,2054908,full.story?coll=la-home-right2 |archivedate=24 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern film studies==
Today film studies exists worldwide as a discipline with specific schools dedicated to it. The aspects of film studies have grown to encompass numerous methods for teaching history, culture and society. Many [[liberal arts]] colleges and universities and contain courses specifically geared toward the analysis of film.&lt;ref name="colbo"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Also exemplifying the increased diversity of film studies is the fact that high schools across the United States offer classes on [[film theory]]. Many programs conjoin film studies with media and television studies, taking knowledge from all parts of visual production in the approach. With the growing technologies such as [[3-D film]] and [[YouTube]], films are now concretely used to teach a reflection of culture and art around the world as a primary medium. Due to the ever-growing dynamic of film studies, a wide variety of curricula have emerged for analysis of critical approaches used in film.&lt;ref&gt;Grieveson, Lee. "Cinema Studies." ''Inventing Film Studies''. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. 67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although each institution has the power to form the study material, students are usually expected to grasp a knowledge of conceptual shifts in film, a vocabulary for the analysis of film form and style, a sense of ideological dimensions of film, and an awareness of extra textual domains and possible direction of film in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dix, Andrew. ''Beginning Film Studies''. Manchester UP. 2-14.

==United States film studies==
In the United States, [[universities]] offer courses specifically toward film studies, and schools committed to minor/major programs. Currently 144 different [[tertiary institutions]] nationwide offer a major program in film studies.&lt;ref name="colbo"/&gt; This number continues to grow each year with new interest in the film studies discipline. Institutions offering film degrees as part of their arts or communications curriculum differ from institutions with a dedicated film program. The curriculum is in no way limited to films made in the United States; a wide variety of films can be analyzed. With the United States' film industry second worldwide only to India, the attraction for film studies is high. To obtain a degree in the United States, a person is likely to pursue careers in the production of film, especially [[Film director|directing]] and [[Film producer|producing]] films.&lt;ref&gt;Polan, Dana, and Haidee Wasson. "Young Art, Old Colleges." Inventing Film Studies. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Often classes in the United States will combine new forms of media, such as television or [[New media]], in combination with film study.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Film Studies in the United States and at Berkeley." Film Studies.

Films can reflect the culture of the period not only in the United States but around the world.

==World film studies==
Film studies throughout the world exist in over 20 countries. Due to the high cost of film production [[Third World|third world countries]] are left out of the film industry especially in the academic setting. Despite this fact more prosperous countries have the ability to study film in all the aspects of film studies.   Discourse in film can be found in the schools around the world; often, international attention to the aesthetics of film emerge from [[film festival]]s. For example, the [[Cannes Film Festival]] is the most prestigious in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/cannes_international_film_festival/index.html|title = Cannes International Film Festival|work = New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this discourse revolves around the film industry and promotion and does not exist within an academic school setting, numerous aspects of analysis and critical approaches are taken into account on this international stage.

==Prominent persons in film studies==
The prominent persons that have influenced the study of film range from [[teachers]] to [[movie producers]] but can be subsumed into two major categories: persons in film production and persons in film criticism.

'''Geomorphology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]]: [[wikt:γῆ|γῆ]], ''gê'', "earth"; [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]], ''morphḗ'', "form"; and λόγος, ''[[Logos|lógos]]'', "study") is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topography|topographic]] and [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] features created by physical, chemical or biological processes operating at or near the Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why [[landscape]]s look the way they do, to understand [[landform]] history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]], [[climatology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.

== Overview ==
[[File:VU0K1843 (39985550).jpg|thumbnail|[[Weathering#Ocean waves|Waves]] and [[Water chemistry analysis|water chemistry]] lead to structural failure in exposed rocks]]
[[Earth]]'s surface is modified by a combination of surface processes that shape landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basin]]s where the surface of the Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth's surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes, or alternatively stated, the intersection of the Earth's [[lithosphere]] with its [[hydrosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].

The broad-scale topographies of the Earth illustrate this intersection of surface and subsurface action. Mountain belts are [[tectonic uplift|uplifted]] due to geologic processes. [[Denudation]] of these high uplifted regions produces [[sediment]] that is transported and [[deposition (geology)|deposited]] elsewhere within the landscape or off the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willett|first=Sean D.|author2=Brandon, Mark T.|title=On steady states in mountain belts|journal=Geology|date=January 2002|volume=30|issue=2|pages=175–178|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030&lt;0175:OSSIMB&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2002Geo....30..175W}}&lt;/ref&gt; On progressively smaller scales, similar ideas apply, where individual landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive processes (uplift and deposition) and subtractive processes ([[subsidence]] and [[erosion]]). Often, these processes directly affect each other: ice sheets, water, and sediment are all loads that change topography through [[flexural isostasy]]. Topography can modify the local climate, for example through [[orographic precipitation]], which in turn modifies the topography by changing the hydrologic regime in which it evolves. Many geomorphologists are particularly interested in the potential for [[Climate change feedback|feedbacks]] between climate and [[erosion and tectonics|tectonics]], mediated by geomorphic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roe|first=Gerard H.|author2=Whipple, Kelin X. |author3=Fletcher, Jennifer K. |title=Feedbacks among climate, erosion, and tectonics in a critical wedge orogen|journal=American Journal of Science|date=September 2008|volume=308|issue=7|pages=815–842|doi=10.2475/07.2008.01|url=http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/Publications/RoeEtal_ClimateWedge_08.pdf|bibcode=2008AmJS..308..815R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these broad-scale questions, geomorphologists address issues that are more specific and/or more local. Glacial geomorphologists investigate glacial deposits such as [[moraine]]s, [[esker]]s, and proglacial [[lake]]s, as well as [[Erosion#Ice|glacial erosional]] features, to build chronologies of both small [[glacier]]s and large [[ice sheet]]s and understand their motions and effects upon the landscape. [[Fluvial]] geomorphologists focus on [[river]]s, how they [[sediment transport|transport sediment]], [[River channel migration|migrate across the landscape]], [[bedrock river|cut into bedrock]], respond to environmental and tectonic changes, and interact with humans. Soils geomorphologists investigate soil profiles and chemistry to learn about the history of a particular landscape and understand how climate, biota, and rock interact. Other geomorphologists study how [[hill]]slopes form and change. Still others investigate the relationships between [[ecology]] and geomorphology. Because geomorphology is defined to comprise everything related to the surface of the Earth and its modification, it is a broad field with many facets.

Geomorphologists use a wide range of techniques in their work. These may include fieldwork and field data collection, the interpretation of remotely sensed data, geochemical analyses, and the numerical modelling of the physics of landscapes. Geomorphologists may rely on [[geochronology]], using dating methods to measure the rate of changes to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, Global Geomorphology, Pearson Education Ltd, 537 p. {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunai, T.J., 2010, Cosmogenic Nucleides, Cambridge University Press, 187 p. {{ISBN|978-0-521-87380-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Terrain measurement techniques are vital to quantitatively describe the form of the Earth's surface, and include [[differential GPS]], remotely sensed [[digital terrain model]]s and [[Lidar#Geology and soil science|laser scanning]], to quantify, study, and to generate illustrations and maps.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/intro.html DTM intro page], Hunter College Department of Geography, New York NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical applications of geomorphology include [[natural hazard|hazard]] assessment (such as [[landslide]] prediction and [[Landslide mitigation|mitigation]]), river control and [[stream restoration]], and coastal protection.  Planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as Mars.   Indications of effects of [[aeolian processes|wind]], [[fluvial]], [[glacial]], [[mass wasting]], [[Impact event|meteor impact]], [[tectonics]] and [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic]] processes are studied. This effort not only helps better understand the geologic and atmospheric history of those planets but also extends geomorphological study of the Earth. Planetary geomorphologists often use [[Terrestrial Analogue Sites|Earth analogue]]s to aid in their study of surfaces of other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference of Geomorphology|url=http://www.geomorphology-iag-paris2013.com/en/s3-%E2%80%93-planetary-geomorphology-iag-wg|publisher=Europa Organization|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317082407/http://www.geomorphology-iag-paris2013.com/en/s3-%E2%80%93-planetary-geomorphology-iag-wg|archivedate=2013-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than some notable exceptions in antiquity, geomorphology is a relatively young science, growing along with interest in other aspects of the [[earth sciences]] in the mid-19th century.  This section provides a very brief outline of some of the major figures and events in its development.

===Ancient geomorphology===

The study of landforms and the evolution of the Earth's surface can be dated back to scholars of [[Classical Greece]]. [[Herodotus]] argued from observations of soils that the [[Nile delta]] was actively growing into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and estimated its age.&lt;ref name='Bierman'&gt;Bierman, Paul R., and David R. Montgomery. Key concepts in geomorphology. Macmillan Higher Education, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] speculated that due to [[sediment transport]] into the sea, eventually those seas would fill while the land lowered. He claimed that this would mean that land and water would eventually swap places, whereupon the process would begin again in an endless cycle.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;

Another early theory of geomorphology was devised by the polymath [[History of China|Chinese]] scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD). This was based on his observation of [[Ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] shells in a [[stratum|geological stratum]] of a mountain hundreds of miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Noticing [[bivalvia|bivalve]] shells running in a horizontal span along the cut section of a cliffside, he theorized that the cliff was once the pre-historic location of a seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles over the centuries. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by [[soil erosion]] of the mountains and by deposition of [[silt]], after observing strange natural erosions of the [[Taihang Mountains]] and the [[Yandangshan|Yandang Mountain]] near [[Wenzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;Sivin, Nathan (1995). ''Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections''. Brookfield, Vermont: VARIORUM, Ashgate Publishing. III, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nj&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1959). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. pp. 603–618.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he promoted the theory of gradual [[climate change]] over centuries of time once ancient petrified [[bamboo]]s were found to be preserved underground in the dry, northern climate zone of ''Yanzhou'', which is now modern day [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province.&lt;ref name=nj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan Kam-leung and Gregory K. Clancey, Hui-Chieh Loy (2002). ''Historical Perspectives on East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine''. Singapore: [[Singapore University Press]]. p. 15. {{ISBN|9971-69-259-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern geomorphology===
The term geomorphology seems to have been first used by [[Laumann]] in an 1858 work written in German. Keith Tinkler has suggested that the word came into general use in English, German and French after [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[W. J. McGee]] used it during the International Geological Conference of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Tinkler, Keith J. A short history of geomorphology. Page 4. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Edward Marr]] in his The Scientific Study of Scenery&lt;ref&gt;Marr, J.E. The Scientific Study of Scenery. Methuen, page iii, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; considered his book as, 'an Introductory Treatise on Geomorphology, a subject which has sprung from the union of Geology and Geography'.

An early popular geomorphic model was the ''geographical cycle'' or ''[[cycle of erosion]]'' model of broad-scale landscape evolution developed by [[William Morris Davis]] between 1884 and 1899.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt; It was an elaboration of the [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] theory that had first been proposed by [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes'&gt;Oldroyd, David R. &amp; Grapes, Rodney H. Contributions to the history of geomorphology and Quaternary geology: an introduction. In: GRAPES, R. H., OLDROYD, D. &amp; GRIGELIS, A. (eds) History of Geomorphology and Quaternary Geology. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 301, 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[valley]] forms, for example, uniformitarianism posited a sequence in which a river runs through a flat terrain, gradually carving an increasingly deep valley, until the [[side valley]]s eventually erode, flattening the terrain again, though at a lower elevation. It was thought that [[tectonic uplift]] could then start the cycle over. In the decades following Davis's development of this idea, many of those studying geomorphology sought to fit their findings into this framework, known today as "Davisian".&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt; Davis's ideas are of historical importance, but have been largely superseded today, mainly due to their lack of predictive power and qualitative nature.&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Walther Penck]] developed an alternative model to Davis's.&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt; Penck thought that landform evolution was better described as an alternation between ongoing processes of uplift and denudation, as opposed to Davis's model of a single uplift followed by decay.&lt;ref name='Ritter'&gt;Ritter, Dale F., R. Craig Kochel, and Jerry R. Miller. Process geomorphology. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasised that in many landscapes slope evolution occurs by backwearing of rocks, not by Davisian-style surface lowering, and his science tended to emphasise surface process over understanding in detail the surface history of a given locality. Penck was German, and during his lifetime his ideas were at times rejected vigorously by the English-speaking geomorphology community.&lt;ref name=OldroydGrapes /&gt; His early death, Davis' dislike for his work, and his at-times-confusing writing style likely all contributed to this rejection.&lt;ref name='Simons'&gt;Simons, Martin (1962), "The morphological analysis of landforms: A new review of the work of Walther Penck (1888–1923)", Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers) 31: 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Davis and Penck were trying to place the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface on a more generalized, globally relevant footing than it had been previously. In the early 19th century, authors – especially in Europe – had tended to attribute the form of landscapes to local [[climate]], and in particular to the specific effects of [[glaciation]] and [[periglacial]] processes. In contrast, both Davis and Penck were seeking to emphasize the importance of evolution of landscapes through time and the generality of the Earth's surface processes across different landscapes under different conditions.

During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale geomorphology was termed "physiography".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "'''''physi'''''cal" and "ge'''''ography'''''", and therefore synonymous with [[physical geography]], and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of [[physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]] while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with "pure morphology", separated from its geological heritage.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many earth scientists for the term "geomorphology" in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Victor R. | authorlink = |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Introduction |publisher=NASA |date=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climatic geomorphology===
{{further|Climatic geomorphology}}
During the age of [[New Imperialism]] in the late 19th century European explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms. As geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns. Climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale. The rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of [[Wladimir Köppen]], [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] and [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]]. [[William Morris Davis]], the leading geomorphologist of his time, recognized the role of climate by complementing his "normal" temperate climate [[cycle of erosion]] with arid and glacial ones.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twidale |first1=C.R.|author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |last2=Lageat |first2=Y. |date=1994 |title=Climatic geomorphology: a critique |url= |journal=[[Progress in Physical Geography]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=319–334 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Climatic geomorphology|year=2004|pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction ''against'' [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] that was by the mid-20th century considered both un-innovative and dubious.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Attack&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flemal |first=Ronald C. |last2= |first2= |date=1971 |title=The Attack on the Davisian System Of Geomorphology: A Synopsis |url= |journal= Journal of Geological Education|volume= 19|issue= |pages=3–13 |doi= 10.5408/0022-1368-XIX.1.3|access-date= |bibcode=1971JGeoE..19....3F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early climatic geomorphology developed primarily in [[continental Europe]] while in the English-speaking world the tendency was not explicit until L.C. Peltier's 1950 publication on a [[periglaciation|periglacial]] cycle of erosion.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994/&gt;

Climatic geomorphology was criticized in a 1969 [[review article]] by [[process geomorphology|process geomorphologist]] D.R. Stoddart.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Thomas|first=Michael F.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Tropical geomorphology|year=2004|pages=1063–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism by Stoddart proved "devastating" sparking a decline in the popularity of climatic geomorphology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly "trivial" methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; In addition some conceptions of climatic geomorphology, like that which holds that chemical weathering is more rapid in tropical climates than in cold climates proved to not be straightforwardly true.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

===Quantitative and process geomorphology===
[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] in the [[Drakensberg]], southern Africa.

Geomorphology was started to be put on a solid quantitative footing in the middle of the 20th century. Following the early work of [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] around the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Ritter' /&gt; a group of mainly American natural scientists, [[geologists]] and [[hydraulic engineers]] including [[William Walden Rubey]], [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]], [[Hans Albert Einstein]], [[Frank Ahnert]], [[John Tilton Hack|John Hack]], [[Luna Leopold]], [[Shields parameter|A. Shields]], [[Thomas Maddock (scientist)|Thomas Maddock]], [[Arthur Strahler]], [[Stanley Schumm]], and [[Ronald Shreve]] began to research the form of landscape elements such as [[rivers]] and [[mass wasting|hillslopes]] by taking systematic, direct, quantitative measurements of aspects of them and investigating the [[Scaling law|scaling]] of these measurements.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Ritter' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/Memorials/v41/Schumm-S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. These methods began to allow prediction of the past and future behavior of landscapes from present observations, and were later to develop into the modern trend of a highly quantitative approach to geomorphic problems. Many groundbreaking and widely cited early geomorphology studies appeared in the [[Bulletin of the Geological Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MORISAWA|first=MARIE|date=1988-07-01|title=The Geological Society of America Bulletin and the development of quantitative geomorphology|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsabulletin/article-abstract/100/7/1016/182157/the-geological-society-of-america-bulletin-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=GSA Bulletin|language=en|volume=100|issue=7|pages=1016|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1988)100&lt;1016:TGSOAB&gt;2.3.CO;2|issn=0016-7606|bibcode=1988GSAB..100.1016M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received only few citations prior to 2000 (they are examples of [[Paper with delayed recognition|"sleeping beauties"]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Evan B|date=2017-04-17|title=Delayed recognition of geomorphology papers in the Geological Society of America Bulletin|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309133317703093|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–368|doi=10.1177/0309133317703093}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a marked increase in quantitative geomorphology research occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=Michael|date=2010-06-01|title=The trajectory of geomorphology|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133310363992|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=265–286|doi=10.1177/0309133310363992|issn=0309-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative geomorphology can involve [[fluid dynamics]] and [[solid mechanics]], [[geomorphometry]], laboratory studies, field measurements, theoretical work, and full [[landscape evolution model]]ing. These approaches are used to understand [[weathering]] and [[pedogenesis|the formation of soils]], [[sediment transport]], landscape change, and the interactions between climate, tectonics, erosion, and deposition.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In Sweden [[Filip Hjulström]]'s doctoral thesis, "The River Fyris" (1935), contained one of the first quantitative studies of geomorphological processes ever published. His students followed in the same vein, making quantitative studies of mass transport ([[Anders Rapp]]), fluvial transport ([[Åke Sundborg]]), delta deposition ([[Valter Axelsson]]), and coastal processes ([[John O. Norrman]]). This developed into "the [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] School of [[Physical Geography]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, KJ, 1985: "The Nature of Physical Geography", E. Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary geomorphology===
Today, the field of geomorphology encompasses a very wide range of different approaches and interests.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt; Modern researchers aim to draw out quantitative "laws" that govern Earth surface processes, but equally, recognize the uniqueness of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate. Particularly important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include:

1) that not all landscapes can be considered as either "stable" or "perturbed", where this perturbed state is a temporary displacement away from some ideal target form.  Instead, dynamic changes of the landscape are now seen as an essential part of their nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whipple |first=Kelin X. |title=Bedrock Rivers and the Geomorphology of Active Orogens |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |date=19 May 2004 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=151–185 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120356 |bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..151W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time scales"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Philip A. |title=Time scales of tectonic landscapes and their sediment routing systems |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |date=2008 |volume=296 |pages=7–28 |doi=10.1144/SP296.2 |bibcode = 2008GSLSP.296....7A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) that many geomorphic systems are best understood in terms of the [[stochastic process|stochasticity]] of the processes occurring in them, that is, the probability distributions of event magnitudes and return times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benda |first=Lee |author2=[[Thomas Dunne (geologist)|Dunne, Thomas]] |title=Stochastic forcing of sediment supply to channel networks from landsliding and debris flow |journal=Water Resources Research |date=December 1997 |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=2849–2863 |doi=10.1029/97WR02388 |bibcode=1997WRR....33.2849B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knighton, David. Fluvial forms and processes: a new perspective. Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has indicated the importance of [[chaos theory|chaotic determinism]] to landscapes, and that landscape properties are best considered [[statistics|statistically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dietrich |first=W.

Albeit having its importance diminished [[climatic geomorphology]] continues to exist as field of study producing relevant research. More recently concerns over [[global warming]] have led to a renewed interest in the field.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

Despite considerable criticism the [[cycle of erosion]] model has remained part of the science of geomorphology.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker/&gt; The model or theory has never been proved wrong,&lt;ref name=Slaymaker/&gt; but neither has it been proven.&lt;ref name=ARoy&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Andre |date= |title=Contemporary Meanings in Physical Geography: From What to Why? |url= |location= |publisher= |page=5 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent difficulties of the model have instead made geomorphological research to advance along other lines.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Slaymaker|first=Olav|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Geomorphic evolution|year=2004|pages=420–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its disputed status in geomorphology, the cycle of erosion model is a common approach used to establish [[denudation chronology|denudation chronologies]], and is thus an important concept in the science of [[historical geology]].&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=David K.C.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Denudation chronology|year=2004|pages=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging its shortcomings modern geomorphologists [[Andrew Goudie (geographer)|Andrew Goudie]] and [[Karna Lidmar-Bergström]] have praised it for its elegance and pedagogical value respectively.&lt;ref name=Naten&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/erosionscykel |title=erosionscykel |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=June 22, 2016 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Cycle of erosion|year=2004|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomorphically relevant processes generally fall into
(1) the production of [[regolith]] by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], 
(2) the [[sediment transport|transport]] of that material, and 
(3) its eventual [[deposition (geology)|deposition]]. Primary surface processes responsible for most topographic features include [[wind]], [[wave]]s, [[weathering|chemical dissolution]], [[mass wasting]], [[groundwater]] movement, [[surface water]] flow, [[glacier|glacial action]], [[tectonism]], and [[volcanism]]. Other more exotic geomorphic processes might include [[periglacial]] (freeze-thaw) processes, salt-mediated action, marine currents activity, seepage of fluids through the seafloor or extraterrestrial impact.

=== Aeolian processes ===
[[File:MoabAlcove.JPG|thumb|Wind-eroded alcove near [[Moab, Utah]]]]
[[Aeolian processes]] pertain to the activity of the [[wind]]s and more specifically, to the winds' ability to shape the surface of the [[Earth]]. Winds may erode, transport, and deposit materials, and are effective agents in regions with sparse [[vegetation]] and a large supply of fine, unconsolidated [[sediment]]s. Although water and mass flow tend to mobilize more material than wind in most environments, aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as [[desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Leeder, M., 1999, Sedimentology and Sedimentary Basins, From Turbulence to Tectonics, Blackwell Science, 592 p. {{ISBN|0-632-04976-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological processes===
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|[[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|Beaver dams]], as this one in [[Tierra del Fuego]], constitute a specific form of zoogeomorphology, a type of biogeomorphology.]]
The interaction of living organisms with landforms, or [[Biogeomorphology|biogeomorphologic processes]], can be of many different forms, and is probably of profound importance for the terrestrial geomorphic system as a whole.  Biology can influence very many geomorphic processes, ranging from [[biogeochemical]] processes controlling [[chemical weathering]], to the influence of mechanical processes like [[burrowing]] and [[tree throw]] on soil development, to even controlling global erosion rates through modulation of climate through carbon dioxide balance. Terrestrial landscapes in which the role of biology in mediating surface processes can be definitively excluded are extremely rare, but may hold important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets, such as [[Geography of Mars|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dietrich |first=William E. |author2=Perron, J.

=== Fluvial processes ===

{{Main|Fluvial}}
{{See also|Hack's law|Sediment transport}}
Rivers and streams are not only conduits of water, but also of [[sediment]]. The water, as it flows over the channel bed, is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream, either as [[bed load]], [[suspended load]] or [[dissolved load]]. The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the river's [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton, D., 1998, ''Fluvial Forms &amp; Processes'', Hodder Arnold, 383 p. {{ISBN|0-340-66313-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to the surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large-scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strahler |first=A. N. |title=Equilibrium theory of erosional slopes approached by frequency distribution analysis; Part II |journal=American Journal of Science |date=1 November 1950 |volume=248 |issue=11 |pages=800–814 |doi=10.2475/ajs.248.11.800|bibcode=1950AmJS..248..800S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burbank |first=D.

As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. These systems take on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable (without faulting). Drainage systems have four primary components: drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, and receiving basin. Some geomorphic examples of fluvial landforms are [[alluvial fan]]s, [[oxbow lake]]s, and [[fluvial terrace]]s.

=== Glacial processes===
[[File:Glacial landscape LMB.png|thumb|right|Features of a glacial landscape]]
[[Glacier]]s, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of [[ice]] down a valley causes [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] and [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]] of the underlying [[rock (geology)|rock]]. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed [[glacial flour]]. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a [[moraine]]. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M.R. &amp; Glasser, N.F., 1996, Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 364 p. {{ISBN|0-471-96345-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of [[Plio-Pleistocene]] landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed [[paraglacial]] processes. This concept contrasts with [[periglacial]] processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Church |first=Michael |author2=Ryder, June M. |title=Paraglacial Sedimentation: A Consideration of Fluvial Processes Conditioned by Glaciation |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |date=October 1972 |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=3059–3072 |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[3059:PSACOF]2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1972GSAB...83.3059C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hillslope processes ===
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|[[Talus cone]]s on the north shore of [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]], [[Svalbard]], Norway. Talus cones are accumulations of coarse hillslope debris at the foot of the slopes producing the material.]]
[[Image:Ferguson-slide.jpg|thumb|The [[Ferguson landslide|Ferguson Slide]] is an active [[landslide]] in the [[Merced River|Merced River canyon]] on [[California State Highway 140]], a primary access road to [[Yosemite National Park]].]]
[[Soil]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope under the force of [[gravity]] via [[Downhill creep|creep]], [[Landslide|slides]], flows, topples, and falls. Such [[mass wasting]] occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].

Ongoing hillslope processes can change the topology of the hillslope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes. Hillslopes that steepen up to certain critical thresholds are capable of shedding extremely large volumes of material very quickly, making hillslope processes an extremely important element of landscapes in tectonically active areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roering |first=Joshua J. |author2=Kirchner, James W. |author3=Dietrich, William E.  |title=Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology |journal=Water Resources Research |date=March 1999 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=853–870 |doi=10.1029/1998WR900090 |url=http://www.geog.uoregon.edu/amarcus/geog607w09/readings/roering-et-al1999_wrr_slopes.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=1999WRR....35..853R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Earth, biological processes such as [[burrowing]] or [[tree throw]] may play important roles in setting the rates of some hillslope processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabet |first=Emmanuel J. |author2=Reichman, O.J. |author3=Seabloom, Eric W.  |title=The Effects of Bioturbation on Soil Processes and Sediment Transport |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |date=May 2003 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=249–273 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141314|bibcode= 2003AREPS..31..249G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igneous processes===
Both [[volcanic]] (eruptive) and [[plutonic]] (intrusive) igneous processes can have important impacts on geomorphology. The action of volcanoes tends to rejuvenize landscapes, covering the old land surface with [[lava]] and [[tephra]], releasing [[pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] material and forcing rivers through new paths.  The cones built by eruptions also build substantial new topography, which can be acted upon by other surface processes. Plutonic rocks intruding then solidifying at depth can cause both uplift or subsidence of the surface, depending on whether the new material is denser or less dense than the rock it displaces.

===Tectonic processes===
{{See also|Erosion and tectonics}}
[[Plate tectonics|Tectonic]] effects on geomorphology can range from scales of millions of years to minutes or less. The effects of tectonics on landscape are heavily dependent on the nature of the underlying [[bedrock]] fabric that more or less controls what kind of local morphology tectonics can shape. [[Earthquake]]s can, in terms of minutes, submerge large areas of land creating new wetlands. [[Isostatic rebound]] can account for significant changes over hundreds to thousands of years, and allows erosion of a mountain belt to promote further erosion as mass is removed from the chain and the belt uplifts. Long-term plate tectonic dynamics give rise to [[orogeny|orogenic belts]], large mountain chains with typical lifetimes of many tens of millions of years, which form focal points for high rates of fluvial and hillslope processes and thus long-term sediment production.

Features of deeper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] dynamics such as [[mantle plume|plumes]] and [[delamination (geology)|delamination]] of the lower lithosphere have also been hypothesised to play important roles in the long term (&gt; million year), large scale (thousands of km) evolution of the Earth's topography (see [[dynamic topography]]).  Both can promote surface uplift through isostasy as hotter, less dense, mantle rocks displace cooler, denser, mantle rocks at depth in the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cserepes |first=L. |author2=Christensen, U.R. |author3=Ribe, N.M.  |title=Geoid height versus topography for a plume model of the Hawaiian swell |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=15 May 2000 |volume=178 |issue=1–2 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00065-0 |bibcode=2000E&amp;PSL.178...29C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seber |first=Dogan |author2=Barazangi, Muawia |author3=Ibenbrahim, Aomar |author4= Demnati, Ahmed  |title=Geophysical evidence for lithospheric delamination beneath the Alboran Sea and Rif–Betic mountains |journal=Nature |date=29 February 1996 |volume=379 |issue=6568 |pages=785–790 |doi=10.1038/379785a0 |bibcode = 1996Natur.379..785S |url=http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/5287/1/Seber1996_Abstract%26Figure.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine processes===
Marine processes are those associated with the action of waves, marine currents and seepage of fluids through the seafloor. [[Mass wasting]] and submarine [[landslide|landsliding]] are also important processes for some aspects of marine geomorphology.&lt;ref&gt;Guilcher, A., 1958. Coastal and submarine morphology. Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ocean basins are the ultimate sinks for a large fraction of terrestrial sediments, depositional processes and their related forms (e.g., sediment fans, [[deltas]]) are particularly important as elements of marine geomorphology.

== Scales ==
Different geomorphological processes dominate at different spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, scales on which processes occur may determine the reactivity or otherwise of landscapes to changes in driving forces such as climate or tectonics.&lt;ref name="Time scales"/&gt; These ideas are key to the study of geomorphology today.

To help categorize landscape scales some geomorphologists might use the following [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]:
* 1st – [[Continent]], [[ocean basin]], climatic zone (~10,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 2nd – Shield, e.g. [[Baltic Shield]], or [[mountain range]] (~1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 3rd – Isolated [[sea]], [[Sahel]] (~100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 4th – [[Massif]], e.g. [[Massif Central]] or Group of related landforms, e.g., [[Weald]] (~10,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 5th – River valley, [[Cotswolds]] (~1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 6th – Individual [[mountain]] or [[volcano]], small valleys (~100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 7th – Hillslopes, stream channels, [[estuary]] (~10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 8th – [[gully]], [[barchannel]] (~1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 9th – Meter-sized features

== Overlap with other fields ==
There is a considerable overlap between geomorphology and other fields. Deposition of material is extremely important in [[sedimentology]].  [[Weathering]] is the chemical and physical disruption of earth materials in place on exposure to atmospheric or near surface agents, and is typically studied by [[soil science|soil scientists]] and environmental [[chemistry|chemists]], but is an essential component of geomorphology because it is what provides the material that can be moved in the first place. [[Civil engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental engineering|environmental]] engineers are concerned with erosion and sediment transport, especially related to [[canal]]s, [[slope stability]] (and [[natural hazard]]s), [[water quality]], coastal environmental management, transport of contaminants, and [[stream restoration]]. Glaciers can cause extensive erosion and deposition in a short period of time, making them extremely important entities in the high latitudes and meaning that they set the conditions in the headwaters of mountain-born streams; [[glaciology]] therefore is important in geomorphology.

The earlier and later stages of development are commonly labeled as juvenile and adult respectively, particularly in relation to leaves.&lt;ref name=McCusker&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McCusker A | title = Flora of Australia Glossary|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage, and the Arts|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/glossaries/vascular/h.html|access-date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by German botanist [[Karl Ritter von Goebel]], along with '''homoblasty''' for plants with leaf characteristics that do not change significantly. [[Leonard Cockayne]] observed that heteroblasty occurred in an unusually high proportion of tree species native to New Zealand.&lt;ref name = "Cockayne_2012"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_44/rsnz_44_00_000130.html | last = Cockayne | first = Leonard | name-list-format = vanc |year= 1912 |title= Observations concerning evolution, derived from ecological studies in New Zealand |journal= Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute |volume=44 |pages= 1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
There are two ways to look at how heteroblasty developed one way is to look at the evolution of heteroblasty and the other is to look at the ecological interactions of heteroblastic plants.

=== Evolution===
Many hypothesize that heteroblasty is a result of [[natural selection]] for species that can best survive in both low and high light environments. As a plant grows in the forest it experiences predictable changes in light intensity. With this in mind a plant that changes its leaf morphology and phyllotaxy to best suit these changes in light intensity could be more competitive than one that has only on leaf form and phyllotaxy.&lt;ref name="Gamage_2007" /&gt; It is also hypothesized that the development of heteroblastic tress preceded the development of divaricating shrub forms which are now very common in [[New Zealand]]. It is though that these shrubs are a mutation from the heteroblastic trees and have lost the ability to develop into the adult stage and so are very similar to heteroblastic trees in their juvenile form. It has also been observed that heteroblastic species do not stem from a single point of origin they are found in many different and unrelated species, because of this it is believed that large-scale convergence evolution had to have occurred for so many unrelated plants to exhibit similar behavior.&lt;ref name="Day_1998" /&gt; 
 
=== Ecology===
Heteroblasty can affect all parts of the plant but the leaves are the most common examples and by far the most studied. It's been hypothesized that the heteroblastic changes are due to changes in the plant's exposure to sun because many species spend their juvenile years in the understory then grow to maturity where they are a part of the top canopy and so have full exposure to the sun. This has not been well studied because the common heteroblastic plants are woody and take so long to grow such as ''[[Eucalyptus grandis]]''.&lt;ref name="Zotz_2011" /&gt; The juvenile plants tend to face more competition and must make special adaptations to succeed that are then unnecessary as a mature plant. For example, a sampling in a dense forest must grow quickly to succeed at first but once it has established itself most woody plants no longer compete severely with their neighbor and so the adaptations needed as a juvenile plant are no longer necessary. This can lead to a change in growth in maturity as the tree faces new environmental factors.&lt;ref name = "Cockayne_2012" /&gt; Such as a need to resist new [[pathogen]]s or [[Parasitism|parasites.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karban|first=Richard|last2=Thaler|first2=Jennifer S. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1999-03-01 | title = Plant Phase Change and Resistance to Herbivory |journal=Ecology|volume=80|issue=2|pages=510–517|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0510:ppcart]2.0.co;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
At the cellular level, there are different ways that a plant controls its growth and development. There are internal and external signals that result in a change in the plant's response. The plants also have genetic predetermined growth patterns.

=== Signaling ===
[[Hormone]]s are known to regulate heteroblastic change in plants. One hormone that has been identified is [[gibberellin]]. In a study, it was used to spontaneously revert the mature form of [[Hedera helix|Hedera ''helix'']] (a common English ivy) to its juvenile form. After being sprayed with [[gibberellin]] acid some of the ivies began to produce aerial roots which are a characteristic of the juvenile form as well as three lobed leaves another characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=William J. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1957|title=Gibberellic Acid and the Reversal of Adult Hedera to a Juvenile State|jstor=2438395|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=44|issue=9|pages=743–746|doi=10.2307/2438395}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also hypothesized that [[auxin]] and [[cytokinin]] when working together can cause the sudden change in phyllotaxy of heterogenetic plants.&lt;ref name="Zotz_2011" /&gt; The gene ABPH1 has been found to code for [[cytokinin]] and when changed in a mutant affected the plant's ability to regulate the phyllotaxy of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee BH, Johnston R, Yang Y, Gallavotti A, Kojima M, Travençolo BA, Costa L, Sakakibara H, Jackson D | title = Studies of aberrant phyllotaxy1 mutants of maize indicate complex interactions between auxin and cytokinin signaling in the shoot apical meristem | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 150 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–16 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19321707 | doi = 10.1104/pp.109.137034 | url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/150/1/205 | pmc = 2675719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis is based mostly on studies done on non-heteroblastic plants and so it is not certain that these are the cause of the sudden changes in a heteroblastic plant. A dramatic change in leaf size is another example of a heteroblastic change in plants and researchers have looked to studies done on non-heteroblastic plants for answers about what hormones and genes could regulate these changes. Aintegumenta has been found to be one of these regulatory genes that regulated cell growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mizukami Y, Fischer RL | title = Plant organ size control: AINTEGUMENTA regulates growth and cell numbers during organogenesis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 942–7 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10639184 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.2.942 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/97/2/942 | pmc = 15435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that many genes are involved in the regulation of leaf size and these genes do not closely interact meaning they are not caused by a master regulator but instead are a part of many different pathways.&lt;ref name="Zotz_2011" /&gt;

===Genetics===
The most common model plants are ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (common name: [[Mouse-Ear Cress|mouse-ear cress]]), ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'' (common name: [[snapdragon]]), and ''[[Zea mays]]'' (common name: corn). None of these are helpful in the study of gene expression in heteroblastic plants because none of them express obvious heteroblastic traits.&lt;ref name="Zotz_2011" /&gt; Researchers in this area of study can use ''Arabidopsis'' to some degree for study as it does undergo some change form the juvenile phase to the mature phase but it is not clearly heteroblastic. If we assume the process of change is similar and uses similar regulations we can use ''Arabidopsis'' to analyze the causes of change in plant growth that may be occurring in the same way but more dramatically in heteroblastic plants and so can only be used to analyze heteroblastic changes. This involves many assumptions though and so researchers are seeking other plants to use as model subjects. The problem with this is that most plants that display heteroblastic growth are woody plants. Their life spans are much longer in general and unlike ''Arabidopsis'' very little of their genomes are known or mapped. A species that shows promise is ''[[Eucalyptus grandis]]''. This tree is grown commonly because of its many uses for teas, oils, and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/Bob_Santos-The_Eucalyptus_of_California.pdf|title=The Eucalyptus of California | last = Santos | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc |date=1997|website=California State University Library|archive-url=|archive-date=June 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree over all is fast growing and widely grown due to its many uses and so is one of the best candidates for genome sequencing, which is being done now so that the tree can be better studied in the future. There is already a complete quantitative trait loci map for the juvenile traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grattapaglia D, Kirst M | title = Eucalyptus applied genomics: from gene sequences to breeding tools | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 179 | issue = 4 | pages = 911–29 | date = 2008-09-01 | pmid = 18537893 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02503.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
These plants are a few of the common examples of heteroblastic plants often found in studies and is far from an all encompassing list. All listed are plants because they are the only organisms that have been found to undergo this growth change it is absent in animals, fungi, and microbes as far as is known to this point.

== Geographic distribution ==
This is a list of places heteroblastic plants have been commonly found and documented but not a complete list of all places as heteroblastic plants can be hard to identify and do not appear in families predictably.

*[[New Zealand]] has a very large population of heteroblastic plants with about 200 tree species and 10% of the woody shrubs species having heteroblastic tendencies.&lt;ref name="Day_1998" /&gt; 
*[[Australia]] also has heteroblastic species though the exact amount is not known.  
*[[South America]] also has a few heteroblastic plants, specifically known in Mexico, and Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="Guzmá_2015" /&gt;

# [[Homoblasty]] is the first example of this. To understand Heteroblasty you must first understand that homoblasty is different. Homoblastic change is the slight change a plant experiences over a long period of time as it grows to maturity. Examples of this are a plants leaves growing slightly larger over time as it matures or a trees trunk growing in girth.&lt;ref name="Zotz_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zotz | first = Gerhard | last2 = Wilhelm | first2 = Kerstin | last3 = Becker | first3 = Annette | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 2011 | title = Heteroblasty—A Review | journal = The Botanical Review | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–151 | doi = 10.1007/s12229-010-9062-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#[[Heterophylly]] is another term that is often used interchangeably with Heteroblasty. The process of heterophylly refers to specifically changes in leaf morphology that lead to variation in leaf shape or size on a single plant. This type of change is seen when you study the individual leaves and compare them, this is different than homoblasty in which the entire foliage changes dramatically but for the most part uniformly. A heteroblastic plant can have heterophyllic changes but they are not the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winn A | date = 1999 | title=The functional significance and fitness consequences of heterophylly|url=|journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume=160|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#[[Phenotypic plasticity|Phenotypic Plasticity]] changes the structure of plants as well but should not be confused with Heteroblasty. Phenotypic plasticity is when an individual can use the same genes to create a different phenotype based on environmental signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pigliucci M, Murren CJ, Schlichting CD | title = Phenotypic plasticity and evolution by genetic assimilation | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 209 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 2362–7 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16731812 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.02070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such as when a plant is adapting its immune system to a new pathogen or when a reptile changes it’s sex based on environmental queues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fusco G, Minelli A | title = Phenotypic plasticity in development and evolution: facts and concepts. Introduction | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

[[File:IFSA Network.png|thumb|IFSA Network Logo]]

The '''IFSA Network''' (previously known as the International Finance Students Association&lt;ref name="IFSA Network"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network Website |url=http://ifsa-network.com/ |website=IFSA Network |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a global [[non-profit organization]] entirely run by students. Its main aim is to give students in the fields of finance, economics, management and engineering, a path to enter the professional world of [[finance]] by providing them with lectures, workshops, competitions and connecting them through a global network.

== History ==
The IFSA Network was founded in 2014 in [[Rotterdam]],&lt;ref name="IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders |url=http://ifsa-network.com/letter-to-stakeholders-16/ |website=IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Rotterdam School of Management]]. Its first focus was to regroup people studying Finance, and connect them both between themselves and established financial actors. It quickly spread across Europe and Asia, before opening chapters in South Africa and the Americas.

== Concept ==
The IFSA Network is composed of different chapters throughout the world. The concept is to have semi-independent units,&lt;ref name="IFSA Network: Who Are We"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network: Who Are We |url=http://ifsa-network.com/who-are-we/ |website=IFSA Network: Who Are We |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; each composed of their own board &amp; active members and to create synergy between these in order to provide the best opportunities to their members. The objective of the association is to build a comprehensive network that connects finance students across the globe and enable them to interact and communicate with each other.

== Hierarchy ==
Each chapter has a board, composed of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasure and General Secretary. This board manages day to day operations locally and supervises its regional activities. Chapters also typically have departments (Finance, Marketing, Events), with a department head managing the analysts.
Chairmen also regularly connect to establish international strategies and overview national operations.

=== Local Venues ===
The various IFSA Network chapters try to offer their communities various local events to connect with the professional world.&lt;ref name="Geneva Students"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geneva students are hungry and getting prepared to face the challenges ! |url=https://www.notzstucki.com/ifsa-event-geneva-students-are-hungry-and-getting-prepared-to-face-the-challenges/ |website=NOTZ STUCKI |publisher=NOTZ STUCKI |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, an industry professional will come to the IFSA Network events and meet students. The purpose of those venues is to give students a taste of the professional world, share tips and knowledge, and give an opportunity to network.

=== Boston Consulting Group Case competition ===
In 2018, the IFSA Network in cooperation with the [[Boston Consulting Group]] and InvestSoc, organised the first, three-week long International Cape Town Case Competition. The competition has a unique format where teams consisting of 2 to 4 participants, propose solutions for crises that are presented to them. In their solutions, participants are able to showcase their knowledge, creativity and problem-solving skills on a current macroeconomic issue. 
A jury picks the 15 best international teams and the best local teams, from Cape Town. The selected teams arrive in [[Cape Town, South Africa]], to participate in the second round, and present in front of a select panel of distinguished professors and practitioners. The winning team is awarded a cash prize of 5000 South African Rand.

== Network Creation ==
The IFSA Network is very selective when it comes to opening chapters and selecting board members. Striving for excellency, it will only open chapters in elite universities, and hires only the most ambitious and brightest students. The purpose of this is to ensure smooth operations and maintain a high-level of execution in all of the organisation’s activities. Ultimately, the goal is to have establishments around the world, regrouping all major academic institutions.

'''Impact evaluation''' assesses the changes that can be attributed to a particular intervention, such as a project, program or policy, both the intended ones, as well as ideally the unintended ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTISPMA/0,,menuPK:384336~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:384329,00.html World Bank Poverty Group on Impact Evaluation], accessed on January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to outcome monitoring, which examines whether targets have been achieved, impact evaluation is structured to answer the question: how would outcomes such as participants' well-being have changed if the intervention had not been undertaken? This involves counterfactual analysis, that is, "a comparison between what actually happened and what would have happened in the absence of the intervention."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/35BC420995BF58F8852571E00068C6BD/$file/impact_evaluation.pdf White, H. (2006) Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, World Bank, Washington, D.C., p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Impact evaluations seek to answer cause-and-effect questions. In other words, they look for the changes in outcome that are directly attributable to a program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=23915 Gertler, Martinez, Premand, Rawlings and Vermeersch (2011) Impact Evaluation in Practice, Washington, DC:The World Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact evaluation helps people answer key questions for evidence-based policy making: what works, what doesn't, where, why and for how much? It has received increasing attention in policy making in recent years in the context of both Western and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2012/05/07/Working_Paper_8.pdf|title=Log in|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important component of the armory of [[evaluation]] tools and approaches and integral to global efforts to improve the effectiveness of aid delivery and public spending more generally in improving living standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprise-development.org/page/download?id=2133, '' Muaz, Jalil Mohammad (2013), Practical Guidelines for conducting research. Summarising good research practice in line with the DCED Standard'']&lt;/ref&gt; Originally more oriented towards evaluation of social sector programs in developing countries, notably [[Conditional Cash Transfer|conditional cash transfers]], impact evaluation is now being increasingly applied in other areas such as the agriculture, energy and transport.

== Counterfactual evaluation designs ==

[[Counterfactual conditional|Counterfactual]] analysis enables evaluators to attribute cause and effect between interventions and outcomes. The 'counterfactual' measures what would have happened to beneficiaries in the absence of the intervention, and impact is estimated by comparing counterfactual outcomes to those observed under the intervention. The key challenge in impact evaluation is that the counterfactual cannot be directly observed and must be approximated with reference to a comparison group. There are a range of accepted approaches to determining an appropriate comparison group for counterfactual analysis, using either prospective (ex ante) or retrospective (ex post) evaluation design. Prospective evaluations begin during the design phase of the intervention, involving collection of baseline and end-line data from intervention beneficiaries (the 'treatment group') and non-beneficiaries (the 'comparison group'); they may involve selection of individuals or communities into treatment and comparison groups. Retrospective evaluations are usually conducted after the implementation phase and may exploit existing survey data, although the best evaluations will collect data as close to baseline as possible, to ensure comparability of intervention and comparison groups.

There are five key principles relating to internal validity (study design) and external validity (generalizability) which rigorous impact evaluations should address: confounding factors, [[selection bias]], spillover effects, contamination, and impact heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2012/04/20/principles-for-impact-evaluation.pdf|title=Log in|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Confounding''' occurs where certain factors, typically relating to socio-economic status, are correlated with exposure to the intervention and, independent of exposure, are causally related to the outcome of interest. Confounding factors are therefore alternate explanations for an observed (possibly spurious) relationship between intervention and outcome.
* '''Selection bias''', a special case of confounding, occurs where intervention participants are non-randomly drawn from the beneficiary population, and the criteria determining selection are correlated with outcomes. [[Unobserved heterogeneity|Unobserved factors]], which are associated with access to or participation in the intervention, and are causally related to the outcome of interest, may lead to a spurious relationship between intervention and outcome if unaccounted for. Self-selection occurs where, for example, more able or organized individuals or communities, who are more likely to have better outcomes of interest, are also more likely to participate in the intervention. Endogenous program selection occurs where individuals or communities are chosen to participate because they are seen to be more likely to benefit from the intervention. Ignoring confounding factors can lead to a problem of omitted variable bias. In the special case of selection bias, the endogeneity of the selection variables can cause simultaneity bias.
* '''Spillover''' (referred to as contagion in the case of experimental evaluations) occurs when members of the comparison (control) group are affected by the intervention. 
* '''Contamination''' occurs when members of treatment and/or comparison groups have access to another intervention which also affects the outcome of interest.
* '''Impact heterogeneity''' refers to differences in impact due by beneficiary type and context. High quality impact evaluations will assess the extent to which different groups (e.g., the disadvantaged) benefit from an intervention as well as the potential effect of context on impact. The degree that results are generalizable will determine the applicability of lessons learned for interventions in other contexts.

Impact evaluation designs are identified by the type of methods used to generate the counterfactual and can be broadly classified into three categories – experimental, quasi-experimental and non-experimental designs – that vary in feasibility, cost, involvement during design or after implementation phase of the intervention, and degree of selection bias. White (2006)&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"&gt;[http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/35BC420995BF58F8852571E00068C6BD/$file/impact_evaluation.pdf White, H. (2006) Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, World Bank, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ravallion (2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTISPMA/Resources/383704-1153333441931/Evaluating_Antipoverty_Programs.pdf Ravallion, M. (2008) Evaluating Anti-Poverty Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; discuss alternate Impact Evaluation approaches.

===Experimental design===
{{further|Experimental design}}

Under experimental evaluations the treatment and comparison groups are selected randomly and isolated both from the intervention, as well as any interventions which may affect the outcome of interest. These evaluation designs are referred to as [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] (RCTs). In experimental evaluations the comparison group is called a [[control group]]. When randomization is implemented over a sufficiently large sample with no contagion by the intervention, the only difference between treatment and control groups on average is that the latter does not receive the intervention. Random sample surveys, in which the sample for the evaluation is chosen randomly, should not be confused with experimental evaluation designs, which require the random assignment of the treatment.

The experimental approach is often held up as the 'gold standard' of evaluation. It is the only evaluation design which can conclusively account for selection bias in demonstrating a causal relationship between intervention and outcomes. Randomization and isolation from interventions might not be practicable in the realm of social policy and may be ethically difficult to defend,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/evoice/v6y2009i2n6.html|title=Should the Randomistas Rule?|first=Ravallion|last=Martin|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–5|accessdate=16 January 2017|via=RePEc - IDEAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there may be opportunities to use natural experiments. Bamberger and White (2007)&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ800319&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ800319 Bamberger, M. and White, H. (2007) Using Strong Evaluation Designs in Developing Countries: Experience and Challenges, ''Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation'', Volume 4, Number 8, 58-73]&lt;/ref&gt; highlight some of the limitations to applying RCTs to development interventions. Methodological critiques have been made by Scriven (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Scriven (2008) A Summative Evaluation of RCT Methodology: &amp; An Alternative Approach to Causal Research, ''Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation'', Volume 5, Number 9, 11-24&lt;/ref&gt; on account of the biases introduced since social interventions cannot be triple blinded, and Deaton (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1335715|title=Instruments of Development: Randomization in the Tropics, and the Search for the Elusive Keys to Economic Development|first=Angus|last=Deaton|date=1 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that in practice analysis of RCTs falls back on the regression-based approaches they seek to avoid and so are subject to the same potential biases. Other problems include the often heterogeneous and changing contexts of interventions, logistical and practical challenges, difficulties with monitoring service delivery, access to the intervention by the comparison group and changes in selection criteria and/or intervention over time. Thus, it is estimated that RCTs are only applicable to 5 percent of development finance.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

===Quasi-experimental design===

[[Quasi-experiment]]al approaches can remove bias arising from selection on observables and, where panel data are available, time invariant unobservables. Quasi-experimental methods include matching, differencing, instrumental variables and the pipeline approach; they are usually carried out by multivariate [[regression analysis]].

If selection characteristics are known and observed, they can be controlled for to remove the bias. Matching involves comparing program participants with non-participants based on observed selection characteristics. [[Propensity score matching]] (PSM) uses a statistical model to calculate the probability of participating on the basis of a set of observable characteristics and matches participants and non-participants with similar probability scores. [[Regression discontinuity design]] exploits a decision rule as to who does and does not get the intervention to compare outcomes for those just either side of this cut-off.

Difference-in-differences or double differences, which use data collected at baseline and end-line for intervention and comparison groups, can be used to account for selection bias under the assumption that unobservable factors determining selection are fixed over time (time invariant).

[[Instrumental Variable|Instrumental variables]] estimation accounts for selection bias by modelling participation using factors ('instruments') that are correlated with selection but not the outcome, thus isolating the aspects of program participation which can be treated as exogenous.

The pipeline approach ([[stepped-wedge trial|stepped-wedge design]]) uses beneficiaries already chosen to participate in a project at a later stage as the comparison group. The assumption is that as they have been selected to receive the intervention in the future they are similar to the treatment group, and therefore comparable in terms of outcome variables of interest. However, in practice, it cannot be guaranteed that treatment and comparison groups are comparable and some method of matching will need to be applied to verify comparability.

===Non-experimental design===

Non-experimental impact evaluations are so-called because they do not involve a comparison group that does not have access to the intervention. The method used in non-experimental evaluation is to compare intervention groups before and after implementation of the intervention. Intervention [[interrupted time-series]] (ITS) evaluations require multiple data points on treated individuals before and after the intervention, while before versus after (or pre-test post-test) designs simply require a single data point before and after. Post-test analyses include data after the intervention from the intervention group only. Non-experimental designs are the weakest evaluation design, because to show a causal relationship between intervention and outcomes convincingly, the evaluation must demonstrate that any likely alternate explanations for the outcomes are irrelevant. However, there remain applications to which this design is relevant, for example, in calculating time-savings from an intervention which improves access to amenities. In addition, there may be cases where non-experimental designs are the only feasible impact evaluation design, such as universally implemented programmes or national policy reforms in which no isolated comparison groups are likely to exist.

== Biases in estimating programme effects ==

Randomized field experiments are the strongest research designs for assessing program impact. This particular research design is said to generally be the design of choice when it is feasible as it allows for a fair and accurate estimate of the program's actual effects (Rossi, Lipsey &amp; Freeman, 2004).

With that said, randomized field experiments are not always feasible to carry out and in these situations there are alternative research designs that are at the disposal of an evaluator. The main problem though is that regardless of which design an evaluator chooses, they are prone to a common problem: Regardless of how well thought through or well implemented the design is, each design is subject to yielding biased estimates of the program effects. These biases play the role of exaggerating or diminishing program effects. Not only that, but the direction the bias may take cannot usually be known in advance (Rossi et al., 2004). These biases affect the interest of the stakeholder. Furthermore, it is possible that program participants are disadvantaged if the bias is in such a way that it contributes to making an ineffective or harmful program seem effective. There is also the possibility that a bias can make an effective program seem ineffective or even as far as harmful. This could possibly make the accomplishments of program seem small or even insignificant therefore forcing the personnel and even cause the program's sponsors to reduce or eliminate the funding for the program (Rossi et al., 2004).

It is safe to say that if an inadequate design yields bias, the stakeholders who are largely responsible for the funding of the program will be the ones most concerned; the results of the evaluation help the stakeholders decide whether or not to continue funding the program because the final decision lies with the funders and the sponsors. Not only are the stakeholders mostly concerned, but those taking part in the program or those the program is intended to positively affect will be affected by the design chosen and the outcome rendered by that chosen design. Therefore, the evaluator's concern is to minimize the amount of bias in the estimation of program effects (Rossi et al., 2004).
 
Biases are normally visible in two situations: when the measurement of the outcome with program exposure or the estimate of what the outcome would have been without the program exposure is higher or lower than the corresponding "true" value (p267). Unfortunately, not all forms of bias that may compromise impact assessment are obvious (Rossi et al., 2004).

The most common form of impact evaluation design is comparing two groups of individuals or other units, an intervention group that receives the program and a control group that does not. The estimate of program effect is then based on the difference between the groups on a suitable outcome measure (Rossi et al., 2004). The random assignment of individuals to program and control groups allows for making the assumption of continuing equivalence. Group comparisons that have not been formed through randomization are known as non-equivalent comparison designs (Rossi et al., 2004).

===Selection bias===

When there is an absence of the assumption of equivalence, the difference in outcome between the groups that would have occurred regardless creates a form of bias in the estimate of program effects. This is known as selection bias (Rossi et al., 2004). It creates a threat to the validity of the program effect estimate in any impact assessment using a non-equivalent group comparison design and appears in situations where some process responsible for influences that are not fully known selects which individuals will be in which group instead of the assignment to groups being determined by pure chance (Rossi et al., 2004).  This may be because of participant self-selection, or it may be because of program placement (placement bias).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/392376/impact-evaluation-development-interventions-guide.pdf|title=Impact Evaluation of Development Interventions: A Practical Guide|last=White|first=Howard|last2=Raitzer|first2=David|publisher=Asian Development Bank|year=2017|isbn=978-92-9261-059-3|location=Manila|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection bias can occur through natural or deliberate processes that cause a loss of outcome data for members of the intervention and control groups that have already been formed. This is known as attrition and it can come about in two ways (Rossi et al., 2004): targets drop out of the intervention or control group cannot be reached or targets refuse to co-operate in outcome measurement. Differential attrition is assumed when attrition occurs as a result of something either than explicit chance process (Rossi et al., 2004). This means that "those individuals that were from the intervention group whose outcome data are missing cannot be assumed to have the same outcome-relevant characteristics as those from the control group whose outcome data are missing" (Rossi et al., 2004, p271). However, random assignment designs are not safe from selection bias which is induced by attrition (Rossi et al., 2004).

===Other forms of bias===

There are other factors that can be responsible for bias in the results of an impact assessment. These generally have to do with events or experiences other than receiving the program that occur during the intervention. These biases include secular trends, interfering events and maturation (Rossi et al., 2004).
 
====Secular trends or secular drift====

Secular trends can be defined as being relatively long-term trends in the community, region or country. These are also termed secular drift and may produce changes that enhance or mask the apparent effects of a (Rossi et al., 2004). For example, when a community's birth rate is declining, a program to reduce fertility may appear effective because of bias stemming from that downward trend (Rossi et al., 2004, p273).

====Interfering events====

Interfering events are similar to secular trends; in this case it is the short-term events that can produce changes that may introduce bias into estimates of program effect, such as a power outage disrupting communications or hampering the delivery of food supplements may interfere with a nutrition program (Rossi et al., 2004, p273).

====Maturation====

Impact evaluation needs to accommodate the fact that natural maturational and developmental processes can produce considerable change independently of the program. Including these changes in the estimates of program effects would result in bias estimates. An example of this form of bias would be a program to improve preventative health practices among adults may seem ineffective because health generally declines with age (Rossi et al., 2004, p273).

"Careful maintenance of comparable circumstances for program and control groups between random assignment and outcome measurement should prevent bias from the influence of other differential experiences or events on the groups. If either of these conditions is absent from the design, there is potential for bias in the estimates of program effect" (Rossi et al., 2004, p274).

== Estimation methods ==

Estimation methods broadly follow evaluation designs. Different designs require different estimation methods to measure changes in well-being from the counterfactual. In experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation, the estimated impact of the intervention is calculated as the difference in mean outcomes between the treatment group (those receiving the intervention) and the control or comparison group (those who don't). This method is also called randomised control trials (RCT). According to an interview with Jim Rough, former representant of the American Evaluation Assosiciation, in the magazine [http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220609/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation] this method doesn't work for complex, multilayer matters. The single difference estimator compares mean outcomes at end-line and is valid where treatment and control groups have the same outcome values at baseline. The difference-in-difference (or double difference) estimator calculates the difference in the change in the outcome over time for treatment and comparison groups, thus utilizing data collected at baseline for both groups and a second round of data collected at end-line, after implementation of the intervention, which may be years later.

Impact Evaluations which have to compare average outcomes in the treatment group, irrespective of beneficiary participation (also referred to as 'compliance' or 'adherence'), to outcomes in the comparison group are referred to as intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Impact Evaluations which compare outcomes among beneficiaries who comply or adhere to the intervention in the treatment group to outcomes in the control group are referred to as treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) analyses. ITT therefore provides a lower-bound estimate of impact, but is arguably of greater policy relevance than TOT in the analysis of voluntary programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED493363.pdf Bloom, H. (2006) The core analytics of randomized experiments for social research. MDRC Working Papers on Research Methodology. MDRC, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==

While there is agreement on the importance of impact evaluation, and a consensus is emerging around the use of counterfactual evaluation methods, there has also been widespread debate in recent years on both the definition of impact evaluation and the use of appropriate methods (see White 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evaluation/working-papers/working-paper-1/ White, H. (2009) Some reflections on current debates in impact evaluation, Working paper 1, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, New Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt; for an overview).

=== Definitions ===

The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) defines rigorous impact evaluations as: "analyses that measure the net change in outcomes for a particular group of people that can be attributed to a specific program using the best methodology available, feasible and appropriate to the evaluation question that is being investigated and to the specific context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2012/04/20/principles-for-impact-evaluation.pdf|title=Log in|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Bank's DIME Initiative, "Impact evaluations compare the outcomes of a program against a counterfactual that shows what would have happened to beneficiaries without the program. Unlike other forms of evaluation, they permit the attribution of observed changes in outcomes to the program being evaluated by following experimental and quasi-experimental designs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEVIMPEVAINI/Resources/DIME_project_document-rev.pdf World Bank (n.d.) The Development IMpact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, Project Document, World Bank, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, according to the US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] impact evaluation is a form of evaluation that assesses the net effect of a program by comparing program outcomes with an estimate of what would have happened in the absence of a program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/evaluate/glossary/i-esd.htm US Environmental Protection Agency Program Evaluation Glossary], accessed on January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Bank's [[Independent Evaluation Group]] (IEG), impact evaluation is the systematic identification of the effects positive or negative, intended or not on individual households, institutions, and the environment caused by a given development activity such as a program or project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/ie/ World Bank Independent Evaluation Group], accessed on January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact evaluation has been defined differently over the past few decades.&lt;ref name="worldbank.org"/&gt; Other interpretations of impact evaluation include:
*An evaluation which looks at the impact of an intervention on final welfare outcomes, rather than only at project outputs, or a process evaluation which focuses on implementation;
*An evaluation carried out some time (five to ten years) after the intervention has been completed so as to allow time for impact to appear; and
*An evaluation considering all interventions within a given sector or geographical area.
Other authors make a distinction between "impact evaluation" and "impact assessment." "Impact evaluation" uses empirical techniques to estimate the effects of interventions and their statistical significance, whereas "impact assessment" includes a broader set of methods, including structural simulations and other approaches that cannot test for statistical significance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Common definitions of 'impact' used in evaluation generally refer to the totality of longer-term consequences associated with an intervention on quality-of-life outcomes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) defines impact as the "positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/43/40501129.pdf OECD-DAC (2002) Glossary of Key Terms in Evaluation and Results-Based Management Proposed Harmonized Terminology, OECD, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of international agencies have also adopted this definition of impact. For example, UNICEF defines impact as "The longer term results of a program – technical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional, environmental or other – whether intended or unintended. The intended impact should correspond to the program goal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/UNICEF_Eval_Report_Standards.pdf UNICEF (2004) UNICEF Evaluation Report Standards, Evaluation Office, UNICEF NYHQ, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Evaluationwiki.org defines impact evaluation as an evaluation that looks beyond the immediate results of policies, instruction, or services to identify longer-term as well as unintended program effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evaluationwiki.org/index.php/Evaluation_Definition:_What_is_Evaluation%3F#Impact_Evaluations|title=Evaluation Definition: What is Evaluation? - EvaluationWiki|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, an evaluation could be conducted to assess 'impact' as defined here without reference to a counterfactual. However, much of the existing literature (e.g. NONIE Guidelines on Impact Evaluation&lt;ref name="worldbank.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/nonie/guidance.html|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopts the OECD-DAC definition of impact while referring to the techniques used to attribute impact to an intervention as necessarily based on counterfactual analysis.

What is missing from the term 'impact' evaluation is the way 'impact' shows up long-term. For instance, most Monitoring and Evaluation 'logical framework' plans have inputs-outputs-outcomes and... impacts. While the first three appear during the project duration itself, impact takes far longer to take place. For instance, in a 5-year agricultural project, seeds are inputs, farmers trained in using them our outputs, changes in crop yields as a result of the seeds being planted properly in an outcome and families being more sustainably food secure over time is an impact.  Such [http://valuingvoices.com/sustained-impact-post-project-ex-post-little-proof-at-3ie/ post-project impact evaluations] are very rare. They are also called ex-post evaluations or we are coining the term [http://valuingvoices.com/what-happens-after-the-project-ends-lessons-from-post-project-sustained-impact-evaluations-part-1/ sustained impact evaluations]. While hundreds of thousands of documents call for them, rarely do donors have the funding flexibility - or interest - to return to see how sustained, and durable our interventions remained after project close out, after resources were withdrawn. There are many [http://valuingvoices.com/what-happens-after-the-project-ends-lessons-from-post-project-sustained-impact-evaluations-part-1/ lessons to be learned for design, implementation, M&amp;E] and how to foster [http://valuingvoices.com/what-happens-after-the-project-ends-country-national-ownership-lessons-from-post-project-sustained-impact-evaluations-part-2/ country-ownership].

=== Methodological debates ===

There is intensive debate in academic circles around the appropriate methodologies for impact evaluation, between proponents of experimental methods on the one hand and proponents of more general methodologies on the other. William Easterly has referred to this as [http://aidwatchers.com/2009/12/the-civil-war-in-development-economics/ 'The Civil War in Development economics']. Proponents of experimental designs, sometimes referred to as 'randomistas',&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; argue randomization is the only means to ensure unobservable selection bias is accounted for, and that building up the flimsy experimental evidence base should be developed as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgoals.net/wp-content/uploads/banerjee.pdf|title=Banerjee, A. V. (2007) 'Making Aid Work' Cambridge, Boston Review Book, MIT Press, MA|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others argue that randomized assignment is seldom appropriate to development interventions and even when it is, experiments provide us with information on the results of a specific intervention applied to a specific context, and little of external relevance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ800319&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ800319 Bamberger, M. and White, H. (2007) Using Strong Evaluation Designs in Developing Countries: Experience and Challenges, Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation, Volume 4, Number 8, 58-73]&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism from evaluation bodies and others that some donors and academics over-emphasize favoured methods for impact evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeanevaluation.org/download/?noGzip=1&amp;id=1969403 EES Statement on the importance of a methodologically diverse approach to impact evaluation&lt;/ref&gt; and that this may in fact hinder learning and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/odi-publications/opinions/127-impact-evaluation.pdf The 'gold standard' is not a silver bullet for evaluation&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there has been a debate around the appropriate role for qualitative methods within impact evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.odi.org/publications/430-aid-effectiveness-role-qualitative-research-impact-evaluation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/146499341201300104&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory-based impact evaluation ===

While knowledge of effectiveness is vital, it is also important to understand the reasons for effectiveness and the circumstances under which results are likely to be replicated. In contrast with 'black box' impact evaluation approaches, which only report mean differences in outcomes between treatment and comparison groups, theory-based impact evaluation involves mapping out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact and testing the underlying assumptions.&lt;ref name="3ieimpact.org"&gt;[http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evaluation/working-papers/working-paper-3/ White, H. (2009b) Theory-based impact evaluation: Principles and practice, Working Paper 3, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, New Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank.org1"/&gt; Most interventions within the realm of public policy are of a voluntary, rather than coercive (legally required) nature. In addition, interventions are often active rather than passive, requiring a greater rather than lesser degree of participation among beneficiaries and therefore behavior change as a pre-requisite for effectiveness. Public policy will therefore be successful to the extent that people are incentivized to change their behaviour favourably. A theory-based approach enables policy-makers to understand the reasons for differing levels of program participation (referred to as 'compliance' or 'adherence') and the processes determining behavior change. Theory-Based approaches use both quantitative and qualitative data collection, and the latter can be particularly useful in understanding the reasons for compliance and therefore whether and how the intervention may be replicated in other settings. Methods of qualitative data collection include focus groups, in-depth interviews, participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and field visits, as well as reading of anthropological and political literature.

White (2009b)&lt;ref name="3ieimpact.org"/&gt; advocates more widespread application of a theory-based approach to impact evaluation as a means to improve policy relevance of impact evaluations, outlining six key principles of the theory-based approach:
# Map out the causal chain (program theory) which explains how the intervention is expected to lead to the intended outcomes, and collect data to test the underlying assumptions of the causal links.
# Understand context, including the social, political and economic setting of the intervention.
# Anticipate heterogeneity to help in identifying sub-groups and adjusting the sample size to account for the levels of disaggregation to be used in the analysis.
# Rigorous evaluation of impact using a credible counterfactual (as discussed above).
# Rigorous factual analysis of links in the causal chain.
# Use mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods).

== Examples ==

While experimental impact evaluation methodologies have been used to assess nutrition and water and sanitation interventions in developing countries since the 1980s, the first, and best known, application of experimental methods to a large-scale development program is the evaluation of the [[Conditional Cash Transfer]] (CCT) program Progresa (now called [[Oportunidades]]) in Mexico, which examined a range of development outcomes, including schooling, immunization rates and child work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/gertler_health.pdf Gertler, P. (2000) Final Report: The Impact of PROGRESA on Health. International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athena.sas.upenn.edu/~petra/papers/trans18.pdf|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCT programs have since been implemented by a number of governments in Latin America and elsewhere, and a report released by the World Bank in February 2009 examines the impact of CCTs across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fiszbein, A. and Schady, N. (2009) Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing present and future poverty: A World Bank Policy Research Report, World Bank, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, impact evaluation has been applied to a range of interventions across social and productive sectors. 3ie has launched an online [http://www.3ieimpact.org/database_of_impact_evaluations.html database of impact evaluations] covering studies conducted in low- and middle income countries. Other organisations publishing Impact Evaluations include [http://poverty-action.org/work/publications Innovations for Poverty Action], the World Bank's [http://www.worldbank.org/dime DIME Initiative] and [http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/nonie/papers.html NONIE]. The [[Independent Evaluation Group|IEG]] of the World Bank has systematically assessed and summarized the experience of ten impact evaluation of development programs in various sectors carried out over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/35BC420995BF58F8852571E00068C6BD/$file/impact_evaluation.pdf Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting impact evaluation of development interventions ==

In 2006, the Evaluation Gap Working Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/7973|title=When Will We Ever Learn? Improving Lives Through Impact Evaluation|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued for a major gap in the evidence on development interventions, and in particular for an independent body to be set up to plug the gap by funding and advocating for rigorous impact evaluation in low- and middle-income countries. The [http://www.3ieimpact.org International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)] was set up in response to this report. 3ie seeks to improve the lives of poor people in low- and middle-income countries by providing, and summarizing, evidence of what works, when, why and for how much. 3ie operates a grant program, financing impact studies in low- and middle-income countries and synthetic reviews of existing evidence updated as new evidence appears, and supports quality impact evaluation through its quality assurance services.

Another initiative devoted to the evaluation of impacts is the [http://sustainablecommodities.org/cosa Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA)].  COSA is a non-profit global consortium of institutions, sustained in partnership with the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) [[Sustainable Commodity Initiative]], the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), and the United Nations [[International Trade Centre]] (ITC). COSA is developing and applying an independent measurement tool to analyze the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices, and in particular those associated with the implementation of specific sustainability programs (Organic, [[Fairtrade]] etc.).  The focus of the initiative is to establish global indicators and measurement tools which farmers, policy-makers, and industry can use to understand and improve their sustainability with different crops or agricultural sectors. COSA aims to facilitate this by enabling them to accurately calculate the relative costs and benefits of becoming involved in any given sustainability initiative.

A number of additional organizations have been established to promote impact evaluation globally, including [http://poverty-action.org/ Innovations for Poverty Action], the [http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sief-trust-fund World Bank's Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF)], the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, the [http://www.cgiar-ilac.org Institutional Learning and Change (ILAC) Initiative] of the CGIAR, and the [http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/nonie/ Network of Networks on Impact Evaluation (NONIE)].

== Systematic reviews of impact evidence ==

A range of organizations are working to coordinate the production of [[systematic reviews]]. Systematic reviews aim to bridge the research-policy divide by assessing the range of existing evidence on a particular topic, and presenting the information in an accessible format. Like rigorous impact evaluations, they are developed from a study Protocol which sets out a priori the criteria for study inclusion, search and methods of synthesis. Systematic reviews involve five key steps: determination of interventions, populations, outcomes and study designs to be included; searches to identify published and unpublished literature, and application of study inclusion criteria (relating to interventions, populations, outcomes and study design), as set out in study Protocol; coding of information from studies; presentation of quantitative estimates on intervention effectiveness using forest plots and, where interventions are determined as appropriately homogeneous, calculation of a pooled summary estimate using meta-analysis; finally, systematic reviews should be updated periodically as new evidence emerges. Systematic reviews may also involve the synthesis of qualitative information, for example relating to the barriers to, or facilitators of, intervention effectiveness.

Organizations supporting the production of systematic reviews include the [http://www.cochrane.org/ Cochrane Collaboration], which has been coordinating systematic reviews in the medical and public health fields since 1993, and publishes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113230/http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/ Cochrane Handbook] which is definitive systematic review methodology guide. In addition, the [http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/ Campbell Collaboration] has coordinated the production of systematic reviews of social interventions since 2000, and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (in partnership with the Campbell Collaboration) is funding systematic reviews of social programs in developing countries. Other organizations supporting systematic reviews include the [http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx Institute of Education's EPPI-Centre] and the [http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/ University of York's Centre for Reviews and Dissemination].

The body of evidence from systematic reviews is large and available through various online portals including the [http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/ Cochrane library], the [http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/library.php Campbell library], and the [http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]. The available evidence from Reviews of development interventions in low- and middle-income countries is being built up by organisations such as the [http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/systematic-reviews/ International Initiative for Impact Evaluation's synthetic reviews programme].

[[Image:Island nations.svg|thumb|350px|Sovereign states and states with limited recognition fully on islands (Australia is regarded a continent), those with land borders shaded green, and those without shaded dark blue]]

This is a '''list of island countries'''. An [[island]] is a land mass (smaller than a [[continent]]) that is surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/island| title=Definition of island| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[island country|island countries]] are spread over an [[archipelago]], as is the case with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Indonesia]] (both of which consist of thousands of islands). Others consist of a single island, such as [[Nauru]], or part of an island, such as [[Haiti]]. Although [[Australia]] is designated as [[Australia (continent)|a continent]], it is often referred to as an island, as it  has no land [[border]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |authorlink= |author2=A.J. Rose, Anneliese Löffler &amp; Denis Warner |title=Australia:Portrait of a Continent |year=1983 |publisher=Hutchinson Group |location=[[Richmond, Victoria]] |page=17 |isbn=0-09-130460-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some declared island countries are not universally recognized as politically independent, such as [[Northern Cyprus]]. Some states, such as [[Taiwan]], officially claim to hold continental territories but are ''de facto'' limited to control over islands.

In [[electronics]], '''Mason's invariant''', named after [[Samuel Jefferson Mason]], is a measure of the quality of [[transistor]]s.

"When trying to solve a seemingly difficult problem, Sam said to concentrate on the easier ones first; the rest, including the hardest ones, will follow," recalled [[Andrew Viterbi]], co-founder and former vice-president of [[Qualcomm]]. He had been a thesis advisee under Samuel Mason at [[MIT]], and this was one lesson he especially remembered from his professor.&lt;ref name='news_office'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Entrepreneur endows chair; Rivest is holder | date=2000-08-09 | publisher=MIT | url =http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/rivest-0809.html | work =MIT News | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years earlier, Mason had heeded his own advice when he defined a unilateral [[power gain]] for a linear [[two-port network|two-port]] device, or U. After concentrating on easier problems with power gain in feedback [[amplifier]]s, a [[figure of merit]] for all three-terminal devices followed that is still used today as Mason's Invariant.&lt;ref name='Gupta'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers, a Classic Revisited |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques |date=May 1992 |first=Madhu |last=Gupta |coauthors= |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=864–879 |id= |url=http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/ee217sp05/mason.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-08 |doi=10.1109/22.137392 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418064920/http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/ee217sp05/mason.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

In 1953, [[transistors]] were only five years old, and they were the only successful, three-terminal [[passivity (engineering)|active device]]. They were beginning to be used for [[Radio frequency|RF]] applications, and they were limited to [[VHF]] frequencies and below. Mason wanted to find a figure of merit to compare transistors, and this led him to discover that the unilateral power [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of a linear [[two-port network|two-port]] device was an invariant figure of merit.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

In his paper ''Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers'' published in 1953, Mason stated in his introduction, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"A [[vacuum tube]], very often represented as a simple [[transconductance]] driving a passive impedance, may lead to relatively simple amplifier designs in which the input impedance (and hence the [[power gain]]) is effectively infinite, the voltage gain is the quantity of interest, and the input circuit is isolated from the load. The transistor, however, usually cannot be characterized so easily."&lt;ref name='Mason'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers|journal=IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory|date=June 1954|first=Samuel|last=Mason|coauthors=|volume=1|issue=2|pages=20–25|id= |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/8148/23422/01083579.pdf?arnumber=1083579|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-08|doi=10.1109/TCT.1954.1083579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; He wanted to find a metric to characterize and measure the quality of transistors since up until then, no such measure existed.  His discovery turned out to have applications beyond transistors.

== Derivation of U ==

Mason first defined the device being studied with the three constraints listed below.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

# The device has only two ports (at which power can be transferred between it and outside devices).
# The device is linear (in its relationships of currents and voltages at the two ports).
# The device is used in a specified manner (connected as an [[amplifier]] between a linear [[one-port]] source and a linear one-port [[Electrical load|load]]).

Then, according to Madhu Gupta in ''Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers, a Classic Revisited'', Mason defined the problem as "being the search for device properties that are invariant with respect to transformations as represented by an embedding network" that satisfy the four constraints listed below.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

# The embedding network is a four-port.
# The embedding network is linear.
# The embedding network is lossless.
# The embedding network is reciprocal.

He next showed that all transformations that satisfy the above constraints can be accomplished with just three simple transformations performed sequentially. Similarly, this is the same as representing an embedding network by a set of three embedding networks nested within one another. The three mathematical expressions can be seen below.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

1. Reactance padding:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z'_{11} &amp; Z'_{12} \\
	Z'_{21} &amp; Z'_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z_{11}+jx_{11} &amp; Z_{12}+jx_{12} \\
	Z_{21}+jx_{21} &amp; Z_{22}+jx_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

2. Real Transformations:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z'_{11} &amp; Z'_{12} \\
	Z'_{21} &amp; Z'_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	n_{11} &amp; n_{12} \\
	n_{21} &amp; n_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z_{11} &amp; Z_{12} \\
	Z_{21} &amp; Z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	n_{11} &amp; n_{12} \\
	n_{21} &amp; n_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Inversion:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z'_{11} &amp; Z'_{12} \\
	Z'_{21} &amp; Z'_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z_{11} &amp; Z_{12} \\
	Z_{21} &amp; Z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Mason then considered which quantities remained invariant under each of these three transformations. His conclusions, listed respectively to the transformations above, are shown below. Each transformation left the values below unchanged.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

1. Reactance padding:
&lt;math&gt;
\left [ Z-Z_{t} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

2. Real transformations:
&lt;math&gt;
\left [ Z-Z_{t} \right ]
\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{\det{\left [ Z-Z_{t} \right ]}}{\det{\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Inversion:
The magnitudes of the two determinants and the sign of the denominator in the above fraction remain unchanged in the inversion transformation. Consequently, the quantity invariant under all three conditions is:&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U &amp; =\dfrac{|\det{\left [ Z-Z_t \right ]}|}{\det{\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]}} \\
&amp; =
\dfrac{|Z_{12}-Z_{21}|^{2}}{4 (\operatorname{Re}[Z_{11}] Re[Z_{22}]-\operatorname{Re}[Z_{12}] \operatorname{Re}[Z_{21}])} \\
&amp; =
\dfrac{|Y_{21}-Y_{12}|^{2}}{4 (\operatorname{Re}[Y_{11}] \operatorname{Re}[Y_{22}]-\operatorname{Re}[Y_{12}] \operatorname{Re}[Y_{21}])}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Importance ==

Mason's Invariant, or U, is the only device characteristic that is invariant under lossless, reciprocal embeddings. In other words, U can be used as a figure of merit to compare any two-port active device (which includes three-terminal devices used as two-ports). For example, a factory producing [[BJT]]s can calculate U of the transistors it is producing and compare their quality to the other BJTs on the market. Furthermore, U can be used as an indicator of activity. If U is greater than one, the two-port device is active; otherwise, that device is passive. This is especially useful in the [[microwave]] engineering community. Though originally published in a circuit theory journal, Mason's paper becomes especially relevant to microwave engineers since U is usually slightly greater than or equal to one in the microwave frequency range. When U is smaller than or considerably larger than one, it becomes relatively useless.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

While Mason's Invariant can be used as a figure of merit across all operating frequencies, its value at '''''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is especially useful.  '''''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the maximum [[oscillation]] frequency of a device, and it is discovered when &lt;math&gt;U(f_\max) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. This frequency is also the frequency at which the maximum stable gain G&lt;sub&gt;ms&lt;/sub&gt; and the maximum available gain G&lt;sub&gt;ma&lt;/sub&gt; of the device become one. Consequently, '''''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a characteristic of the device, and it has the significance that it is the maximum frequency of oscillation in a circuit where only one active device is present, the device is embedded in a passive network, and only single [[sinusoidal]] signals are of interest.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

== Conclusion ==
In his revisit of Mason's paper, Gupta states, "Perhaps the most convincing evidence of the utility of the concept of a unilateral power gain as a device figure of merit is the fact that for the last three decades, practically every new, active, two-port device developed for high frequency use has been carefully scrutinized for the achievable value of U..."&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; This assumption is appropriate because "U&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;" or "maximum unilateral gain" is still listed on transistor specification sheets, and Mason's Invariant is still taught in some undergraduate electrical engineering curricula. Though now it has been over five decades, Mason's finding of an invariant device characteristic still plays a significant role in transistor design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">'''Mating types''' are molecular mechanisms that regulate compatibility in sexually reproducing [[eukaryote]]s. They occur in [[isogamy|isogamous]] and [[anisogamous]] species. Depending on the group, different mating types are often referred to by numbers, letters, or simply "+" and "-" instead of "male" and "female", that refer to "sexes" or differences in size between gametes.  [[Syngamy]] can only take place between gametes carrying different mating types.

Reproduction regulated by mating types is especially prevalent in [[Fungus|fungi]]. Filamentous [[ascomycete]]s usually have two mating types referred to as "MAT1-1" and "MAT1-2", following the yeast mating type locus MAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoder|first1=O.C.|last2=Valent|first2=Barbara|last3=Chumley|first3=Forrest|title=Genetic Nomenclature and Practice for Plant Pathogenic Fungi|journal=Phytopathology|date=1986|volume=76|issue=4|pages=383–385|url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1986Articles/Phyto76n04_383.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under standard nomenclature, MAT1-1 (which may informally be called MAT1) encodes for a regulatory protein with a high motility-group (HMG) DNA-binding motif, while MAT1-2 (informally called MAT2) encodes for a protein with an alpha box motif, as in the yeast mating type MATα1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turgeon|first1=B.G.|last2=Yoder|first2=O.C.|title=Proposed Nomenclature for Mating Type Genes of Filamentous Ascomycetes|journal=Fungal Genetics and Biology|date=2000|volume=31|pages=1–5|doi=10.1006/fgbi.2000.1227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding mating types in yeast, a non-filamentous ascomycete, are referred to as MATa and MATα.

Mating type genes in ascomycetes are called idiomorphs rather than alleles due to the uncertainty of the origin by common descent. The proteins they encode are transcription factors that regulate both the early and late stages of the sexual cycle. [[Heterothallic]] ascomycetes produce gametes that present a single Mat idiomorph and [[Fertilisation|syngamy]] will only be possible between gametes carrying complementary mating types. On the other hand, [[homothallic]] ascomycetes produce gametes that can fuse with every other gamete in the population (including its own mitotic descendants) most often because each haploid contains the two alternate forms of the Mat locus in its genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giraud|first=T. | title = Mating system of the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum: Selfing under heterothallism | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | year = 2008 | volume = 7 | pages = 765–775 | doi=10.1128/ec.00440-07|display-authors=etal|pmc=2394975}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Basidiomycete]]s on the other hand can have thousands of different mating types.&lt;ref name="Casselton"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Casselton LA | title = Mate recognition in fungi | journal = Heredity | year = 2002 | volume = 88 | pages = 142–147 | pmid = 11932772 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800035|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptive function of mating type in the ascomycete Neurospora crassa is discussed in the article ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.  That matings in ''N. crassa'' are restricted to interaction of strains of opposite mating type may be an adaptation to promote some degree of outcrossing.  Outcrossing, through [[complementation (genetics)|complementation]], could provide the benefit of masking recessive deleterious mutations in genes that function in the dikaryon and/or diploid stage of the life cycle.

In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''maxima and minima''' (the respective plurals of '''maximum''' and '''minimum''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], known collectively as '''extrema''' (the plural of '''extremum'''), are the largest and smallest value of the function, either within a given range (the '''local''' or '''relative''' extrema) or on the entire [[domain of a function]] (the '''global''' or '''absolute''' extrema).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Thomas | first1 = George B. | last2=Weir | first2= Maurice D. | last3=Hass | first3=Joel |author3-link = Joel Hass| authorlink=George B.

As defined in [[set theory]], the maximum and minimum of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] are the [[Greatest element|greatest and least elements]] in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of [[real number]]s, have no minimum or maximum.

A real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' defined on a [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''maximum point''' at ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. Similarly, the function has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''minimum point''' at ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the '''maximum value''' of the function and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the '''minimum value''' of the function.

If the domain ''X'' is a [[metric space]] then ''f'' is said to have a '''local''' (or '''relative''') '''maximum point''' at the point ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if there exists some ''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0 such that ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the function has a '''local minimum point''' at ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;. A similar definition can be used when ''X'' is a [[topological space]], since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods.

In both the global and local cases, the concept of a '''strict''' extremum can be defined. For example, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''strict global maximum point''' if, for all ''x'' in ''X'' with ''x'' ≠ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, we have ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''f''(''x''), and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''strict local maximum point''' if there exists some ''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0 such that, for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; with ''x'' ≠ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, we have ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''f''(''x''). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.

A [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function with a [[Compact space|compact]] domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed (and bounded) [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[real number]]s (see the graph above).

==Finding functional maxima and minima==
Finding global maxima and minima is the goal of [[mathematical optimization]]. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the [[extreme value theorem]] global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the largest (or smallest) one.

Local extrema of differentiable functions can be found by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], which states that they must occur at [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s. One can distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum by using the [[first derivative test]], [[derivative test#Second derivative test (single variable)|second derivative test]], or [[higher-order derivative test]], given sufficient differentiability.

For any function that is defined [[piecewise]], one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is largest (or smallest).

==Examples==
[[Image:xth root of x.svg|thumb|right|The global maximum of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{x}&lt;/math&gt; occurs at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.]]
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a unique global minimum at ''x'' = 0.
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has no global minima or maxima.  Although the first derivative (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is 0 at ''x'' = 0, this is an [[inflection point]].
* The function &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{x}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique global maximum at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''. (See figure at right)
* The function x&lt;sup&gt;−x&lt;/sup&gt; has a unique global maximum over the positive real numbers at ''x'' = 1/''e''.
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3 − ''x'' has first derivative ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 and [[second derivative]] 2''x''.  Setting the first derivative to 0 and solving for ''x'' gives stationary points at −1 and +1.  From the sign of the second derivative we can see that −1 is a local maximum and +1 is a local minimum.  Note that this function has no global maximum or minimum.
* The function |''x''| has a global minimum at ''x'' = 0 that cannot be found by taking derivatives, because the derivative does not exist at ''x'' = 0.
* The function cos(''x'') has infinitely many global maxima at 0, ±2{{pi}}, ±4{{pi}}, ..., and infinitely many global minima at ±&amp;pi;, ±3&amp;pi;, ….
* The function 2 cos(''x'') − ''x'' has infinitely many local maxima and minima, but no global maximum or minimum.
* The function cos(3{{pi}}''x'')/''x'' with 0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;1.1 has a global maximum at ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0.1 (a boundary), a global minimum near ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0.3, a local maximum near ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0.6, and a local minimum near ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 1.0. (See figure at top of page.)
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''x'' + 1 defined over the closed interval (segment) [−4,2] has a local and maximum at ''x'' = −1−{{radic|15}}/3, a local minimum at ''x'' = −1+{{radic|15}}/3, a global maximum at ''x'' = 2 and a global minimum at ''x'' = −4.

==Functions of more than one variable==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Indifference curve]] --&gt;

[[File:Modell einer Peanoschen Fläche -Schilling XLIX, 1-.jpg|thumb|[[Peano surface]], a counterexample to some criteria of local maxima of the 19th century]]
For functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure at the right, the necessary conditions for a ''local'' maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first [[partial derivatives]] as to  ''z'' (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative.  These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum because of the possibility of a [[saddle point]]. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function ''z'' must also be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] throughout. The [[second partial derivative test]] can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.
In contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function ''f'' defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the [[intermediate value theorem]] and [[Rolle's theorem]] to prove this by [[reductio ad absurdum]]). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails, as the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)= x^2+y^2(1-x)^3,\qquad x,y\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;
shows. Its only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with ƒ(0,0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. However, it cannot be a global one, because ƒ(2,3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−5.

==Maxima or minima of a functional==
If the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions, i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]], the extremum is found using the [[calculus of variations]].

==In relation to sets==
Maxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an [[ordered set]] ''S'' has a [[greatest element]] ''m'', ''m'' is a [[maximal element]]. Furthermore, if ''S'' is a subset of an ordered set ''T'' and ''m'' is the greatest element of ''S'' with respect to order induced by ''T'', ''m'' is a [[supremum|least upper bound]] of ''S'' in ''T''. The similar result holds for [[least element]], [[minimal element]] and [[infimum|greatest lower bound]].

In the case of a general [[partial order]], the '''least element''' (smaller than all other) should not be confused with a '''minimal element''' (nothing is smaller).  Likewise, a '''[[greatest element]]''' of a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is an [[upper bound]] of the set which is contained within the set, whereas a '''maximal element''' ''m'' of a poset ''A'' is an element of ''A'' such that if ''m'' ≤ ''b'' (for any ''b'' in ''A'') then ''m'' = ''b''. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.  If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.

In a [[total order|totally ordered]] set, or ''chain'', all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element.  Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set we can simply use the terms '''''minimum''''' and '''''maximum'''''. If a chain is finite then it will always have a maximum and a minimum.  If a chain is infinite then it need not have a maximum or a minimum.  For example, the set of [[natural number]]s has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain ''S'' is bounded, then the [[topological closure|closure]] ''Cl(S)'' of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in such case they are called the '''greatest lower bound''' and the '''least upper bound''' of the set ''S'', respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1121">'''Load''', in mechanics, is the external mechanical resistance against which a machine, such as a motor or engine, acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]].&lt;/ref&gt; The load can often be expressed as a curve of [[force (physics)|force]] versus speed.

==Vehicle==
For instance, a given car traveling on a road of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more [[torque]] at a higher speed in order to maintain the speed. By shifting to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine speed, whereas shifting to a lower gear has the opposite effect. Accelerating increases the load, whereas decelerating decreases the load.

==Pump==
Similarly, the load on a [[pump]] depends on the [[hydrostatic head|head]] against which the pump is pumping, and on the size of the pump.

==Fan==
Similar considerations apply to a [[Mechanical fan|fan]]. See [[Affinity laws]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7150">'''Performance rating''' is the step in the [[Performance measurement|work measurement]] in which the [[:wikt:analyst|analyst]] observes the worker's performance and records a value representing that performance relative to the analyst's concept of standard performance.&lt;ref&gt;Groover, Mikell P. Work Systems and Methods, measurement, and Management of Work. Pearson Education International, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance rating helps people do their jobs better, identifies [[training]] and [[education]] needs, assigns people to work they can excel in, and maintains fairness in [[Salary|salaries]], benefits, [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]], hiring, and firing. Most workers want to know how they are doing on the job. Workers need performance [[feedback]] to work effectively. Accessing an employee timely, accurate, constructive feedback is key to effective performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology Inc.|title=Performance Management|url=http://www.siop.org/business/performance.aspx|accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivational strategies such as goal setting depend upon regular performance updates. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training  and through the use of [[behaviorally anchored rating scales]]. In [[industrial and organizational psychology]] such scales are used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance.

There are several methods of performance rating. The simplest and most common method is based on [[speed]] or [[pace (speed)|pace]]. Dexterity and effectiveness are also important considerations when assessing performance.  Standard performance is denoted as 100.&lt;ref&gt;Kanawaty, George, ed. ''Introduction to Work Study''. 4th ed. Geneva, Switzerland: International Labor Office, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; A performance rating greater than 100 means the worker's performance is more than standard, and less than 100 means the worker's performance is less than standard.  It is important to note that standard performance is not necessarily the performance level expected of workers, the term standard can be misleading.  For example, a standard performance rating of a worker walking is 4.5 miles/hour.  The ratings is used in conjunction with a timing study to level out actual time (observed time) taken by the worker under observation. This leads to a basic minute value (observed time/100*rating).  This balances out fast and slow workers to get to a standard/average time.  Standard at a 100 is not a percentage, it simply makes the calculations easier.  Most companies that set targets using work study methods will set it at a level of around 85, not 100.

==Attributions to work performance==
Performance rating has become a continuous process by which an employer and employees attempt to understand company goals and how his or her progress toward contributing to them are measured. Performance measurement is an ongoing activity for all managers and their [[Hierarchy|subordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hakala|first=David|title=16 Ways to Measure Employee Performance|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/16-ways-measure-performance-021908/|publisher=HR Newsletter|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A performance measurement uses the following indicators:
* Quantity: addresses how much work is produced. A quantity measure can be expressed as an error rate, such as number one percentage of errors allowable per unit of work, or as a general result to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=n.a|title=Performance Management Cycle|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/planning/developing-performance-standards/|publisher=opm.gov|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quality: address how well the work is performed and/or how accurate or how effective the final product is.
* Timeliness: addresses how quickly, when or by what date the work is produced. The most common error made in setting timeliness standards is to allow no margin for error. As with other standards, timeliness standards should be set realistically in view of other performance requirements and needs of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=n.a|title=Performance Management Cycle|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/planning/developing-performance-standards/|publisher=opm.gov|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cost-effectiveness: addresses dollar savings to the organization or working within a budget. Standards that address [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] should be based on specific resource levels (money, personnel, or time) that generally can be documented and measured in agencies' annual [[fiscal year]] budgets. Cost-effectiveness standards may include such aspects of performance as maintaining or reducing unit costs, reducing the time it takes to produce a product or service, or reducing waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=n.a|title=Performance Management Cycle|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/planning/developing-performance-standards/|publisher=opm.gov|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Absenteeism/tardiness:  addresses the ability for employee to show up at work and on time. How it is affecting their work performance and other employees.
* Adherence to policy: addresses deviation from policy and performance goals.
* Professional appearance: addresses how well employees conduct themselves in the work place and comply with dress code/working environment.

==Effectiveness of performance rating==
The purpose of performance rating is to provide [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] evaluation of the employees’ contribution to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Dr. Bill|title=Effective Performance Appraisal|url=http://extensionhr.osu.edu/resources/codir/guides/gs9.htm|publisher=Ohio State Extension|accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the combination of indicators and [[performance management]], combined with intensifying work, transforms the work of employees and of the managers. On the managerial level, the will of hierarchy to fulfill performance indicators is dependent on task prioritizing, which is not shared amongst everyone. 

Performance Rating intensifies{{clarify|date=February 2016}} the environment of the organization but provides structure for production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuvass|first=Bard|title=Performance appraisal satisfaction and employee outcomes: mediating and moderating roles of work motivation|journal=International Journal of Human Resource Management|date=3 March 2006| volume=17| issue=3| page=542| url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=84f39f29-de24-463d-8e34-ebdc6c0209bd%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=9&amp;hid=4102|accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance satisfaction{{clarify|date=February 2016}} is found to be directly related to both affective commitment and intention of employee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22346">'''Photosynthesis systems''' are [[Electronics|electronic]] [[scientific]] instruments designed for non-destructive measurement of photosynthetic rates in the field. Photosynthesis systems are commonly used in [[agronomic]] and [[Environmental science|environmental]] research, as well as studies of the global carbon cycle.

== How photosynthesis systems function ==
Photosynthesis systems function by measuring gas exchange of [[leaves]]. Atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] is taken up by leaves in the process of [[photosynthesis]], where {{co2}} is used to generate sugars in a molecular pathway known as the [[Calvin cycle]]. This draw-down of {{co2}} induces more atmospheric {{co2}} to diffuse through [[stomata]] into the air spaces of the leaf. While stoma are open, water vapor can easily diffuse out of plant tissues, a process known as [[transpiration]]. It is this exchange of {{co2}} and water vapor that is measured as a proxy of photosynthetic rate.

The basic components of a photosynthetic system are the leaf chamber, [[infrared]] gas analyzer (IRGA), batteries and a console with keyboard, display and memory. Modern 'open system' photosynthesis systems also incorporate miniature disposable compressed gas cylinder and gas supply pipes. This is because external air has natural fluctuations in {{co2}} and water vapor content, which can introduce measurement noise.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; Modern 'open system' photosynthesis systems remove the {{co2}} and water vapour by passage over soda lime and Drierite, then add {{co2}} at a controlled rate to give a stable {{co2}} concentration.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; Some systems are also equipped with temperature control and a removable light unit, so the effect of these environmental variables can also be measured.

The leaf to be analysed is placed in the leaf chamber. The {{co2}} concentrations is measured by the infrared gas analyzer.&lt;ref name=function/&gt; The IRGA shines infrared light through a gas sample onto a detector. {{co2}} in the sample absorbs energy, so the reduction in the level of energy that reaches the detector indicates the {{co2}} concentration. Modern IRGAs take account of the fact that {{h2o}} absorbs energy at similar wavelengths as {{co2}}.&lt;ref name=old/&gt;&lt;ref name=irga&gt;http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/21666630/1095837104/name/IRGA2010.doc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=problems/&gt; Modern IRGAs may either dry the gas sample to a constant water content or incorporate both a {{co2}} and a water vapour IRGA to assess the difference in {{co2}} and water vapour concentrations in air between the chamber entrance and outlet.&lt;ref name=old&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Long | first1 = S. P. | last2 = Farage | first2 = P. K. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = R. L. | title = Measurement of leaf and canopy photosynthetic CO2exchange in the field | doi = 10.1093/jxb/47.11.1629 | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 47 | pages = 1629–1642 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liquid Crystal Display]] on the console displays measured and calculated data. The console may have a PC card slot. The stored data can be viewed on the LCD display, or sent to a PC. Some photosynthesis systems allow communication over the internet using standard internet communication protocols.

Modern photosynthetic systems may also be designed to measure leaf temperature, chamber air temperature, PAR ([[photosynthetically active radiation]]), and [[atmospheric pressure]]. These systems may calculate [[water use efficiency]] (A/E), [[stomatal conductance]] (gs), intrinsic [[water use efficiency]] (A/gs), and sub-stomatal {{co2}} concentration (Ci).&lt;ref name=irga/&gt; Chamber and leaf temperatures are measured with a thermistor sensor. Some systems are also designed to control environmental conditions.

A simple and general equation for Photosynthesis is:
{{co2}}+ {{h2o}}+ (Light Energy)→ C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;+O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== 'Open' systems or 'closed' systems ==
There are two distinct types of photosynthetic system; ‘open’ or ‘closed’.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; This distinction refers to whether or not the atmosphere of the leaf-enclosing chamber is renewed during the measurement.&lt;ref name=old/&gt;&lt;ref name=problems&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jahnke | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1046/j.0016-8025.2001.00776.x | title = Atmospheric CO2 concentration does not directly affect leaf respiration in bean or poplar | journal = Plant, Cell and Environment | volume = 24 | pages = 1139–1151 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an ‘open system’, air is continuously passed through the leaf chamber to maintain {{co2}}  in the leaf chamber at a steady concentration.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; The leaf to be analysed is placed in the leaf chamber. The main console supplies the chamber with air at a known rate with a known concentration of {{co2}} and {{h2o}}.&lt;ref name=function&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Donahue | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Poulson | first2 = M. E. | last3 = Edwards | first3 = G. E. | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–269 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005834327441 | title =  A method for measuring whole plant photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The air is directed over the leaf, then the {{co2}} and {{h2o}} concentration of air leaving the chamber is determined.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; The out going air will have a lower {{co2}}  concentration and a higher {{h2o}} concentration than the air entering the chamber. The rate of {{co2}} uptake is used to assess the rate of photosynthetic [[carbon assimilation]], while the rate of water loss is used to assess the rate of transpiration. Since {{co2}} intake and {{h2o}} release both occur through the stomata, high rates of {{co2}} uptake are expected to coincide with high rates of transpiration. High rates of {{co2}} uptake and {{h2o}} loss indicates high stomatal conductance.&lt;ref name=field&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weather.nmsu.edu/Teaching_Material/soil698/Student_Material/Photosynthesis/ |title=Field Photosynthesis Measurement Systems|publisher=New Mexico State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the atmosphere is renewed, 'open' systems are not seriously affected by outward gas leakage and [[adsorption]] or [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] by the materials of the system.&lt;ref name=old/&gt;

In contrast, in a ‘closed system’, the same atmosphere is continuously measured over a period of time to establish rates of change in the parameters.&lt;ref name="closed"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Gurner | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Austin | first3 = R. B. | title = A new infra-red gas analyser and portable photosynthesis meter | doi = 10.1007/BF00040712 | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 3 | pages = 141–151 | year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{co2}}  concentration in the chamber is decreased, while the {{h2o}} concentration increases. This is less tolerant to leakage and material ad/absorption.

== Calculating photosynthetic rate and related parameters ==

=== Calculations used in 'open system' systems; ===
For CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[diffusion|diffuse]] into the leaf, stomata must be open, which permits the outward diffusion of water vapour. Therefore, the conductance of stomata influences both photosynthetic rate (A) and transpiration (E), and the usefulness of measuring A is enhanced by the simultaneous measurement of E. The internal {{co2}}  concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is also quantified, since C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents an indicator of the availability of the primary substrate (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for A.&lt;ref name=irga/&gt;&lt;ref name=field/&gt;

A [[carbon assimilation]] is determined by measuring the rate at which the leaf assimilates {{co2}} .&lt;ref name=field/&gt; The change in {{co2}}  is calculated as {{co2}}  flowing into leaf chamber, in [[μ]][[mole (unit)|mol]] mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{co2}}, minus flowing out from leaf chamber, in μmol mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The photosynthetic rate (Rate of {{co2}}  exchange in the leaf chamber) is the difference in {{co2}}  concentration through chamber, adjusted for the molar flow of air per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of leaf area, mol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The change in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] is water vapour pressure out of leaf chamber, in mbar, minus the water vapour pressure into leaf chamber, in mbar. Transpiration rate is differential water vapour concentration, mbar, multiplied by the flow of air into leaf chamber per square meter of leaf area, mol s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, divided by atmospheric pressure, in mBar.

=== Calculations used in 'closed system' systems; ===
A leaf is placed in the leaf-chamber, with a known area of leaf enclosed. Once the chamber is closed, carbon dioxide concentration gradually declines. When the concentration decreases past a certain point a timer is started, and is stopped as the concentration passes at a second point. The difference between these concentrations gives the change in carbon dioxide in [[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name="closed"/&gt; Net photosynthetic rate in micro grams carbon dioxide s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is given by;

(V • p • 0.5 • FSD • 99.7) / t&lt;ref name="closed"/&gt;

where V = the chamber volume in liters, p = the density of carbon dioxide in mg&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, FSD = the carbon dioxide concentration in ppm corresponding to the change in carbon dioxide in the chamber, t = the time in seconds for the concentration to decrease by the set amount. Net photosynthesis per unit leaf area is derived by dividing net photosynthetic rate by the leaf area enclosed by the chamber.&lt;ref name="closed"/&gt;

== Applications ==

Since photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance are an integral part of basic plant [[physiology]], estimates of these parameters can be used to investigate numerous aspects of plant [[biology]]. The plant-scientific community has generally accepted photosynthetic systems as reliable and accurate tools to assist research. There are numerous [[peer-reviewed]] articles in scientific journals which have used a photosynthetic system. To illustrate the utility and diversity of applications of photosynthetic systems, below you will find brief descriptions of research using photosynthetic systems;

* Researchers from the [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]] and a number of US institutions studied the combined effects of drought and heat stress on ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. Their research suggests that the combined effects of heat and drought stress cause sucrose to serve as the major osmoprotectant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rizhsky | first1 = L. | last2 = Liang | first2 = H. | last3 = Shuman | first3 = J. | last4 = Shulaev | first4 = V. | last5 = Davletova | first5 = S. | last6 = Mittler | first6 = R. | title = When Defense Pathways Collide.

15047901| pmc =419842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plant physiologists from The University of Putra Malaysia and The [[University of Edinburgh]] investigated the relative effects of tree age and tree size on the physiological attributes of two broadleaf species. A photosynthetic system was used to measure photosynthetic rate per unit of leaf mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abdul-Hamid | first1 = H. | last2 = Mencuccini | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1093/treephys/tpn001 | title = Age- and size-related changes in physiological characteristics and chemical composition of Acer pseudoplatanus and Fraxinus excelsior trees | journal = Tree Physiology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–38 | year = 2008 | pmid =  
19203930| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers at [[University of California-Berkeley]] found that water loss from leaves in ''Sequoia sempervirens'' is ameliorated by heavy fog in the Western US. Their research suggests that fog may help the leaves retain water and enable the trees to fix more carbon during active growth periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burgess | first1 = S. S. O. | last2 = Dawson | first2 = T. E. | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2004.01207.x | title = The contribution of fog to the water relations of Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don): foliar uptake and prevention of dehydration | journal = Plant, Cell and Environment | volume = 27 | pages = 1023–1034 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment on the photosynthetic behavior of an endangered medicinal herb was investigated by this team at Garhwal University, India. Photosynthetic rate (A) was stimulated during the first 30 days, then significantly decreased. [[Transpiration]] rate (E) decreased significantly throughout the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment, whereas [[stomatal conductance]] (gs) significantly reduced initially. Overall, it was concluded that the medicinally important part of this plant showed increased growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.americanscience.org/journals/am-sci/0505/14_0932_MS_CO2_enrichment_am0505.pdf |title=Effect of CO2 Enrichment on Photosynthetic Behavior of Podophyllum hexandrum Royle, an Endangered Medicinal Herb. |journal=Journal of American Science |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=113–118 |year=2009 |author=Ashish Kumar Chaturvedi *, Rajiv Kumar Vashistha, Neelam Rawat, Pratti Prasad and Mohan Chandra Nautiyal |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers at the [[University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro]], Portugal grew Grapevines in outside plots and in Open-Top Chambers which elevated the level of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A photosynthetic system was used to measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E), and internal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration/ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio (Ci/Ca). The environmental conditions inside the chambers caused a significant reduction in yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moutinho-Pereira | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Bacelar | first2 = E.

* A study of Nickel [[bioremediation]] involving poplar (''Populas nigra''), conducted by researchers at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the National Research Institute of Italy ([[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]), found that Ni-induced stress reduced photosynthesis rates, and that this effect was dependent upon leaf Ni content. In mature leaves, Ni stress led to emission of cis-β-ocimene, whereas in developing leaves, it led to enhanced [[isoprene]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Velikova | first1 = V. | last2 = Tsonev | first2 = T. | last3 = Loreto | first3 = F. | last4 = Centritto | first4 = M. | title = Changes in photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance to CO2, and isoprenoid emissions in Populus nigra plants exposed to excess nickel | doi = 10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.032 | journal = Environmental Pollution | volume = 159 | issue = 5 | pages = 1058–1066 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21126813| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plant physiologists in Beijing measured photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance in plants which accumulate metal and those that do not accumulate metal. Seedlings were grown in the presence of 200 or 400 μM [[Cadmium chloride|CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. This was used to elucidate the role of [[antioxidative]] enzyme in the adaptive responses of metal-accumulators and non-accumulators to Cadmium stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Y. | last3 = Huang | first3 = Z. | last4 = Huang | first4 = L. | title = Antioxidative response of metal-accumulator and non-accumulator plants under cadmium stress | doi = 10.1007/s11104-008-9641-1 | journal = Plant and Soil | volume = 310 | pages = 137–149 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a study of drought resistance and salt tolerance of a rice variety, researchers at the National Center of Plant Gene Research and the [[Huazhong Agricultural University]] in Wuhan, China found that a transgenic rice variety showed greater drought resistance than a conventional variety. Over expression of the stress response gene SNAC1 led to reduced water loss, but no significant change in photosynthetic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hu | first1 = H. | last2 = Dai | first2 = M. | last3 = Yao | first3 = J. | last4 = Xiao | first4 = B. | last5 = Li | first5 = X. | last6 = Zhang | first6 = Q. | last7 = Xiong | first7 = L. | title = Overexpressing a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor enhances drought resistance and salt tolerance in rice | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0604882103 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 103 | pages = 12987–12992 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16924117| pmc = 1559740|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10312987H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This Canadian team examined the dynamic responses of Stomatal conductance (gs) net photosynthesis (A) to a progressive drought in nine poplar clones with contrasting drought tolerance. gs and A were measured using a photosynthetic system.  Plants were either well-watered or drought preconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Silim | first1 = S. | last2 = Nash | first2 = R. | last3 = Reynard | first3 = D. | last4 = White | first4 = B. | last5 = Schroeder | first5 = W. | title = Leaf gas exchange and water potential responses to drought in nine poplar (Populus spp.) clones with contrasting drought tolerance | doi = 10.1007/s00468-009-0338-8 | journal = Trees | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 959–969 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers at [[Banaras Hindu University]], India, investigated the potential of sewage sludge to be used in agriculture as an alternative disposal technique. Agricultural soil growing rice had sewage sludge added at different rates. Rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of the rice were measured to examine the biochemical and physiological responses of sewage addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = R.

* Researchers from [[Lancaster University]], The [[University of Liverpool]], and The [[University of Essex]], UK, measured isoprene emission rates from an oil palm tree. Samples were collected using a photosynthetic system that controlled PAR and leaf temperature (1000 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 30&amp;nbsp;°C). It had thought that  PAR and temperature are the main controls of isoprene emission from the biosphere. This research showed that isoprene emissions from oil palm tree are under strong circadian control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Owen | first2 = S.

* The ecophysiological diversity and the breeding potential of wild coffee populations in Ethiopia was evaluated as a thesis submitted to The [[University of Bonn|Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-University]] of Bonn, Germany. Complementary field and garden studies of populations native to a range of climatic conditions were examined. Plant ecophysiological behavior was assessed by a number of system parameters, including gas exchange, which was measured using a photosynthetic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=98591145x&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=98591145x.pdf |title=Ecophysiological diversity of wild Coffea arabica populations in Ecophysiological diversity of wild Coffea arabica populations in |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A collaborative project between researchers at the [[University of Cambridge]], UK, the Australian Research Council Center of Excellence, and the [[Australian National University]] resulted in validation of a model that describes carbon isotope discrimination for crassulacean acid metabolism using ''Kalanchoe daigremontiana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Griffiths | first1 = H. | last2 = Cousins | first2 = A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37664">[[File:Nonproteinogenic AAs.svg|thumbnail|400 px|Proteinogenic amino acids are a small fraction of all amino acids]]
'''Proteinogenic amino acids''' are [[amino acid]]s that are incorporated biosynthetically into [[protein]]s during [[translation (biology)|translation]]. The word "proteinogenic" means "protein creating". Throughout known [[life]], there are 22 genetically encoded (proteinogenic) amino acids, 20 in the standard [[genetic code]] and an additional 2 that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrogelly A, Palioura S, Söll D | title = Natural expansion of the genetic code | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17173027 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio847 | url = http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v3/n1/abs/nchembio847.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[non-proteinogenic amino acids]] are amino acids that are either not incorporated into proteins (like [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]], [[L-DOPA|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-DOPA]], or [[triiodothyronine]]), misincorporated in place of a genetically encoded amino acid, or not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (like [[hydroxyproline]]). The latter often results from [[post-translational modification]] of proteins. Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are incorporated into [[nonribosomal peptide]]s which are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.

Both [[eukaryote]]s and [[prokaryote]]s can incorporate [[selenocysteine]] into their proteins via a nucleotide sequence known as a [[SECIS element]], which directs the cell to translate a nearby UGA [[codon]] as [[selenocysteine]] (UGA is normally a [[stop codon]]).  In some [[methanogenic]] prokaryotes, the UAG codon (normally a stop codon) can also be translated to [[pyrrolysine]].&lt;ref name="LobanovTuranov2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lobanov AV, Turanov AA, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN | title = Dual functions of codons in the genetic code | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20446809 | pmc = 3311535 | doi = 10.3109/10409231003786094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eukaryotes, there are only 21 proteinogenic amino acids, the 20 of the standard genetic code, plus selenocysteine. Humans can synthesize 12 of these from each other or from other molecules of intermediary metabolism. The other nine must be consumed (usually as their protein derivatives), and so they are called [[essential amino acid]]s.  The essential amino acids are [[histidine]], [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]] (i.e. H, I, L, K, M, F, T, W, V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR | title = Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 124 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 1517S-1523S | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8064412 | doi = 10.1093/jn/124.suppl_8.1517S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proteinogenic amino acids have been found to be related to the set of [[amino acid]]s that can be recognized by [[ribozyme]] autoaminoacylation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erives A | title = A model of proto-anti-codon RNA enzymes requiring L-amino acid homochirality | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 73 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 10–22 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21779963 | pmc = 3223571 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-011-9453-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-proteinogenic amino acids would have been excluded by the contingent evolutionary success of nucleotide-based life forms. Other reasons have been offered to explain why certain specific non-proteinogenic amino acids are not generally incorporated into proteins; for example, [[ornithine]] and [[homoserine]] cyclize against the peptide backbone and fragment the protein with relatively short [[Biological half-life|half-lives]], while others are toxic because they can be mistakenly incorporated into proteins, such as the arginine analog [[canavanine]].

== Structures ==

The following illustrates the structures and abbreviations of the 21 amino acids that are directly encoded for protein synthesis by the genetic code of eukaryotes.  The structures given below are standard chemical structures, not the typical [[zwitterion]] forms that exist in aqueous solutions.

== Chemical properties ==

Following is a table listing the one-letter symbols, the three-letter symbols, and the chemical properties of the side chains of the standard amino acids. The masses listed are based on weighted averages of the elemental [[isotope]]s at their [[natural abundance]]s. Forming a [[peptide bond]] results in elimination of a molecule of [[water (molecule)|water]], so the mass of an amino acid unit within a protein chain is reduced by 18.01524 Da.

N.D.: The pKa value of Pyrrolysine has not been reported.

Note: The pKa value of an amino-acid residue in a small peptide is typically slightly different when it is inside a protein. [[Protein pKa calculations]] are sometimes used to calculate the change in the pKa value of an amino-acid residue in this situation.

===Mass spectrometry===
In [[mass spectrometry]] of peptides and proteins, knowledge of the masses of the residues is useful. The mass of the peptide or protein is the sum of the residue masses plus the mass of [[Water (molecule)|water]] ([[Monoisotopic mass]] = 18.01056 Da; average mass = 18.0153 Da). The residue masses are calculated from the tabulated chemical formulas and atomic weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl |title=Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions for All Elements |access-date=2016-12-12 |publisher=NIST }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mass spectrometry]], ions may also include one or more [[protons]] ([[Monoisotopic mass]] = 1.00728 Da; average mass = 1.0074 Da).

| A
| Ala
| Very abundant and very versatile, it is more stiff than glycine, but small enough to pose only small steric limits for the protein conformation. It behaves fairly neutrally, and can be located in both hydrophilic regions on the protein outside and the hydrophobic areas inside.

| C
| Cys
| The sulfur atom bonds readily to [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] ions. Under oxidizing conditions, two cysteines can join together in a [[disulfide bond]] to form the amino acid [[cystine]]. When cystines are part of a protein, [[insulin]] for example, the [[tertiary structure]] is stabilized, which makes the protein more resistant to [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]; therefore, disulfide bonds are common in proteins that have to function in harsh environments including digestive enzymes (e.g., [[pepsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]) and structural proteins (e.g., [[keratin]]). Disulfides are also found in peptides too small to hold a stable shape on their own (e.g. [[insulin]]).
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Aspartic acid]]
| D
| Asp
| Asp behaves similarly to glutamic acid, and carries a hydrophilic acidic group with strong negative charge. Usually, it is located on the outer surface of the protein, making it water-soluble. It binds to positively charged molecules and ions, and is often used in enzymes to fix the metal ion. When located inside of the protein, aspartate and glutamate are usually paired with arginine and lysine.
|-

| Essential for humans, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contain a large, rigid [[aromaticity|aromatic]] group on the side chain. These are the biggest amino acids. Like isoleucine, leucine, and valine, these are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards the interior of the folded protein molecule. Phenylalanine can be converted into tyrosine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Glycine]]
| G
| Gly
| Because of the two hydrogen atoms at the α carbon, glycine is not [[optical isomerism|optically active]]. It is the smallest amino acid, rotates easily, and adds flexibility to the protein chain. It is able to fit into the tightest spaces, e.g., the triple helix of [[collagen]]. As too much flexibility is usually not desired, as a structural component, it is less common than alanine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Histidine]]
| H
| His
| His is essential for humans. In even slightly acidic conditions, [[protonation]] of the nitrogen occurs, changing the properties of histidine and the polypeptide as a whole.  It is used by many proteins as a regulatory mechanism, changing the conformation and behavior of the polypeptide in acidic regions such as the late [[endosome]] or [[lysosome]], enforcing conformation change in enzymes. However, only a few histidines are needed for this, so it is comparatively scarce.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Isoleucine]]
| I
| Ile
| Ile is essential for humans. Isoleucine, leucine, and valine have large aliphatic hydrophobic side chains. Their molecules are rigid, and their mutual hydrophobic interactions are important for the correct folding of proteins, as these chains tend to be located inside of the protein molecule.

|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Lysine]]
| K
| Lys
| Lys is essential for humans, and behaves similarly to arginine. It contains a long, flexible side chain with a positively charged end. The flexibility of the chain makes lysine and arginine suitable for binding to molecules with many negative charges on their surfaces. E.g., [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]]-binding proteins have their active regions rich with arginine and lysine. The strong charge makes these two amino acids prone to be located on the outer hydrophilic surfaces of the proteins; when they are found inside, they are usually paired with a corresponding negatively charged amino acid, e.g., aspartate or glutamate.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Leucine]]
| L
| Leu
| Leu is essential for humans, and behaves similarly to isoleucine and valine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Methionine]]
| M
| Met
| Met is essential for humans. Always the first amino acid to be incorporated into a protein, it is sometimes removed after translation. Like cysteine, it contains sulfur, but with a [[methyl]] group instead of hydrogen. This methyl group can be activated, and is used in many reactions where a new carbon atom is being added to another molecule.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Asparagine]]
| N
| Asn
| Similar to aspartic acid, Asn contains an [[amide]] group where Asp has a [[carboxyl]].
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Pyrrolysine]]
| O
| Pyl
| Similar to [[lysine]], but it has a [[pyrroline]] ring attached.  
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Proline]]
| P
| Pro
| Pro contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO-NH amide sequence into a fixed conformation. It can disrupt protein folding structures like [[alpha helix|α helix]] or [[beta sheet|β sheet]], forcing the desired kink in the protein chain. Common in [[collagen]], it often undergoes a [[post-translational modification]] to [[hydroxyproline]].
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Glutamine]]
| Q
| Gln
| Similar to glutamic acid,  Gln contains an [[amide]] group where Glu has a [[carboxyl]]. Used in proteins and as a storage for [[ammonia]], it is the most abundant amino acid in the body.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Arginine]]
| R
| Arg
| Functionally similar to lysine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Serine]]
| S
| Ser
| Serine and threonine have a short group ended with a hydroxyl group. Its hydrogen is easy to remove, so serine and threonine often act as hydrogen donors in enzymes. Both are very hydrophilic, so the outer regions of soluble proteins tend to be rich with them.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Threonine]]
| T
| Thr
| Essential for humans, Thr behaves similarly to serine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Selenocysteine]]

| Sec
| The [[selenium]] analog of cysteine, in which [[selenium]] replaces the [[sulfur]] atom.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Valine]]
| V
| Val
| Essential for humans, Val behaves similarly to isoleucine and leucine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Tryptophan]]
| W
| Trp
| Essential for humans, Trp behaves similarly to phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is a precursor of [[serotonin]] and is naturally [[fluorescent]].

|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Tyrosine]]
| Y
| Tyr
| Tyr behaves similarly to phenylalanine (precursor to tyrosine) and tryptophan, and is a precursor of [[melanin]], [[epinephrine]], and [[thyroid hormone]]s. Naturally [[fluorescent]], its fluorescence is usually quenched by energy transfer to tryptophans.

==Life based on alternative proteinogenic sets ==
The proteinogenic set used by known life on Earth appears to be arbitrarily selected by evolution, according to current knowledge, from many hundreds of possible alpha-type amino acids.  [[Xenobiology]] studies hypothetical life forms that could be constructed using alternative sets using [[expanded genetic code]]s.   [[Stanley Miller|Miller]]-type experiments on artificial [[abiogenesis]] show that alpha-type amino acids predominate in water-based 'primordial soups', but beta-type amino acids dominate when less water is present.  Both alpha- and beta-based sets could form the basis for alternative protein constructions and life forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14520">'''Religious education''' is the term given to  [[education]] concerned with [[religion]]. It may refer to education provided by a [[Church body|church]] or religious organization, for instruction in [[doctrine]] and [[faith]], or for  education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or [[moral]] aims, e.g. in a [[school]] or [[college]]. The term is often known as [[religious studies]].

==England==
Religious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the [[public education|state education]] system in [[England]].  Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines.

Religious Education in [[England]] is mandated by the [[Education Act 1944]] as amended by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] and the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]]. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any of the children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve.&lt;ref name="withdraw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|title=Religious Education&amp;nbsp;— collective worship and the right to withdraw|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193803/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|archivedate=2008-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year.&lt;ref name="collwors"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|title=Collective worship|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|year=2005|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044304/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|archivedate=2008-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some "schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship" due to what they thought was "a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship" although Smalley noted that "there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed."&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4693129.stm|title=School worship: from sports to death|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=BBC|author=Lucy Wilkins|work=BBC News website | date=2005-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Teachers]] suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools.&lt;ref name="nutbbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7311178.stm|title=Call to offer faith class choice|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|author=Hannah Goff|work=BBC News website | date=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England]] has a Local Agreed [[Syllabus]] which mandate subject teaching for each [[Key Stage]] and possibly for each school year. The [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page/@id=6004&amp;Subject/@id=7881|title=Religious Education: non-statutory framework|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|year=2004|author=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|work=National Curriculum Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211211245/http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page%2F%40id=6004&amp;Subject%2F%40id=7881|archivedate=2007-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education : ''éducation civique, juridique et sociale'', ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education.

==Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Israel==
Israeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/taulwps/fp/art44 A. Maoz, "Religious Education in Israel", 83  U. Det. Mercy L. Rev (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;679-728.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
The prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional [[Secularism|separation of state and religion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called {{nihongo|"Ethics"|{{ruby-ja|道徳|どうとく}}|doutoku|''lit.'' "morality"}} in [[primary school]], where the purpose is to teach [[moral values]] rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated [[secular]] stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts.

==Lebanon==
Being a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by "ethics" classes.
Private Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Malaysia==
The Malaysian education system makes ''Moral Studies'' compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in ''Islamic Studies'' lessons. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the "Moral" subject, primarily due to the strict exam-oriented marking-schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019192539/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |archivedate=2008-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland ==
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}
In [[Scotland|Scottish]] state schools, Religious Education is called ''Religious and Moral Education'' from ages 5 to 14, and ''Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies'' from 14 to 18.

The majority of [[state school]]s in are [[Secular Education|non-denominational]], but as a result of the [[Education Act 1918]], separate denominational [[state school]]s were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are [[Roman Catholic]] but there are also a number of [[Scottish Episcopal]] schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then,the Catholic schools are fully funded by the [[Scottish Government]] and administered by the [[Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate]]. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland]], which also appoints a [[chaplain]] to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school.

==South Africa==
The [[South Africa]]n National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum. The policy does not apply to [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|publisher=info.gov.za|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131232848/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeenah|first=Na'eem|editor1-first=Brian|editor1-last=Ramadiro|editor2-first=Salim|editor2-last=Vally|title=Education Rights for Learners, Parents and Educators Book 5: Religion and Schools|url=http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|publisher=Education Rights Project|accessdate=20 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030181341/http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==
The majority of middle eastern countries provide compulsory religious studies in both private and public schools. The religious studies in private schools can be based on the religious beliefs of the student and can be complied with by the school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16046">[[File:Perotin - Alleluia nativitas.jpg|thumb|Pérotin, "Alleluia nativitas", in the third rhythmic mode.]]
In [[medieval music]], the '''rhythmic modes''' were set patterns of long and short [[duration (music)|duration]]s (or [[rhythm]]s). The value of each [[musical notation|note]] is not determined by the form of the written note (as is the case with more recent European musical notation), but rather by its position within a group of notes written as a single figure called a [[Ligature (music)|"ligature"]], and by the position of the ligature relative to other ligatures. '''Modal notation''' was developed by the composers of the [[Notre Dame school]] from 1170 to 1250, replacing the even and unmeasured rhythm of early [[polyphony]] and [[plainchant]] with patterns based on the metric feet of classical poetry, and was the first step towards the development of modern [[mensural notation]] {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=221}}. The rhythmic modes of Notre Dame Polyphony were the first coherent system of rhythmic notation developed in Western music since antiquity.

==History==
Though the use of the rhythmic modes is the most characteristic feature of the music of the late [[Notre Dame school]], especially the compositions of [[Pérotin]], they are also predominant in much of the rest of the music of the ''[[ars antiqua]]'' until about the middle of the 13th century. Composition types which were permeated by the modal rhythm include Notre Dame [[organum]] (most famously, the organum triplum and organum quadruplum of Pérotin), [[conductus]], and [[Clausula (music)|discant clausulae]]. Later in the century, the motets by [[Petrus de Cruce]] and the many anonymous composers, which were descended from discant clausulae, also used modal rhythm, often with much greater complexity than was found earlier in the century: for example each voice sometimes sang in a different mode, as well as a different language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In most sources there were six rhythmic modes, as first explained in the anonymous treatise of about 1260, ''De mensurabili musica'' (formerly attributed to [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], who is now believed merely to have edited it in the late 13th century for [[Jerome of Moravia]], who incorporated it into his own compilation) {{harv|Baltzer|2001}}. Each mode consisted of a short pattern of long and short note values ("[[Longa (music)|longa]]" and "[[Double whole note|brevis]]") corresponding to a [[metrical foot]], as follows {{harv|Reese|1940|loc=207–209}}:

# Long-short ([[trochee]])
# Short-long ([[Iamb (foot)|iamb]])
# Long-short-short ([[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]])
# Short-short-long ([[anapaest]])
# Long-long ([[spondee]])
# Short-short-short ([[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]])

Although this system of six modes was recognized by medieval theorists, in practice only the first three and fifth patterns were commonly used, with the first mode being by far the most frequent {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=223}}. The fourth mode is rarely encountered, an exception being the second clausula of ''Lux magna'' in MS Wolfenbüttel 677, fol. 44 {{harv|Hughes|1956a|loc=320}}. The fifth mode normally occurs in groups of three and is used only in the lowest voice (or tenor), whereas the sixth mode is most often found in an upper part {{harv|Hughes|1954a|loc=320}}.

Modern transcriptions of the six modes usually are as follows:

# Quarter ([[crotchet]]), eighth ([[quaver]]) (generally [[meter (music)|barred]], therefore, in 3/8 or, because the patterns usually repeat an even number of times, in 6/8 (Apel 1961, 221))&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 1.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 1.mid|Play X4}}
# Eighth, quarter (barred in 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 2.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 2.mid|Play X4}}
# Dotted quarter, eighth, quarter (barred in 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 3.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 3.mid|Play X2}}
# Eighth, quarter, dotted quarter (barred in 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 4.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 4.mid|Play X2}}
# Dotted quarters (barred in either 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 5.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 5.mid|Play X2}}
# Eighths (barred in 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 6.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 6.mid|Play X4}}
*Cooper (1973, 30) gives the above but doubled in length, thus 1) is {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} barred in 3/4, for example.
*Riemann (1962, 135) is another modern exception, who also gives the values twice as long, in 3/4 time, but in addition holds that the third and fourth modes were really intended to represent the modern {{music|common-time}}, with duple rhythms ( {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} and {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|half}}, respectively).

==Notation==
[[File:Pérotin - Viderunt omnes.jpg|thumb|Pérotin, ''Viderunt omnes'' (Gradual for Christmas Day), in the first rhythmic mode. MS Florence, Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana, Pluteo 29.1, fol. 1 recto.]]
Devised in the last half of the 12th century {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=97}}, the notation of rhythmic modes used stereotyped combinations of ligatures (joined noteheads) to indicate the patterns of long notes (longs) and short notes (breves), enabling a performer to recognize which of the six rhythmic modes was intended for a given passage.
Linked notes in groups of:
3, 2, 2, 2, etc. indicate the first mode,
2, 2, 2, 2, … 3 the second mode, 
1, 3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the third mode,
3, 3, 3, … 1 the fourth mode,
3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the fifth mode, 
and 4, 3, 3, 3, etc. the sixth mode
{{harv|Hughes 1954a|loc=323–24}}.
The reading and performance of the music notated using the rhythmic modes was thus based on context. After recognizing which of the six modes applied to a passage of [[neume]]s, a singer would generally continue on in that same mode until the end of a phrase, or a [[cadence (music)|cadence]]. In modern editions of medieval music, ligatures are represented by horizontal brackets over the notes contained within it.

All the modes adhere to a ternary principle of metre, meaning that each mode would have a number of beat subdivisions divisible by the number 3. Some medieval writers explained this as veneration for the perfection of the Holy Trinity, but it appears that this was an explanation made after the event, rather than a cause ({{harvnb|Reese|1940|loc=274}}; {{harvnb|Hughes|1954a|loc=319–20}}). Less speculatively, the flexibility of rhythm possible within the system allows for variety and avoids monotony. Notes could be broken down into shorter units (called ''fractio modi'' by [[Anonymous IV]]) or two rhythmic units of the same mode could be combined into one (''extensio modi'') {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=98–99}}. An alternative term used by Garlandia for both types of alteration was "reduction" {{harv|Roesner|2001}}. These alterations may be accomplished in several ways: ''extensio modi'' by the insertion of single (unligated) long notes or a smaller-than-usual ligature; ''fractio modi'' by the insertion of a larger-than-usual ligature, or by special signs. These were of two types, the ''plica'' and the ''climacus'' {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}.

The ''plica'' was adopted from the liquescent neumes (''cephalicus'') of chant notation, and receives its name (Latin for "fold") from its form which, when written as a separate note, had the shape of a U or an inverted U. In modal notation, however, the plica usually occurs as a vertical stroke added to the end of a ligature, making it a ''ligatura plicata''. The plica usually indicates an added breve on a weak beat {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The pitch indicated by the plica depends on the pitches of the note it is attached to and the note following it. If both notes are the same, then the plica tone is the upper or lower neighbor, depending on the direction of the stem. If the interval between the main notes is a third, then the plica tone fills it in as a passing tone. If the two main notes are a second apart, or at an interval of a fourth or larger, musical context must decide the pitch of the plica tone {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=227}}.

[[File:Climacus.gif|thumb|The ''climacus''.]] [[File:Clivis cumpunctis carrée.jpg|thumb|''climacus'' with ligature]]
The ''climacus'' is a rapid descending scale figure, written as a single note or a ligature followed by a series of two or more descending lozenges. Anonymous IV called these ''currentes'' (Latin "running"), probably in reference to the similar figures found in pre-modal Aquitanian and Parisian polyphony. [[Franco of Cologne]] called them ''coniunctura'' (Latin for "joined [note]"). When consisting of just three notes (''coniunctura ternaria'') it is rhythmically identical with the ordinary three-note ligature, but when containing more notes this figure may be rhythmically ambiguous and therefore difficult to interpret {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The difficulty was compounded in the later half of the 13th century, when the lozenge shape came also to be used for the [[semibreve]]. A general rule is that the last note is a longa, the second-last note is a breve, and all the preceding notes taken together occupy the space of a longa. However, the exact internal rhythm of these first notes of the group requires some interpretation according to context {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=240}}.

It was also possible to change from one mode to another without a break, which was called "admixture" by Anonymous IV, writing around 1280 {{harv|Roesner|2001}}.

[[File:Alteratio.png|thumbnail|Tenor from Motet "Homo, luge!"/"Homo miserabilis"/"Brumans e mors" (13th century). Third rhythmic mode, syllabic notation.]]
Because a ligature cannot be used for more than one syllable of text, the notational patterns can only occur in [[melisma]]tic passages. Where syllables change frequently or where pitches are to be repeated, ligatures must be broken up into smaller ligatures or even single notes in so-called "syllabic notation", often creating difficulty for the singers, as was reported by Anonymous IV ({{harvnb|Apel|1961|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Roesner|2001}}).

An '''ordo''' (plural ''ordines'') is a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] constructed from one or more statements of one modal pattern and ending in a rest. Ordines were described according to the number of repetitions and the position of the concluding rest. "Perfect" ordines ended with the first note of the pattern followed by a rest substituting for the second half of the pattern, and "imperfect" ordines ended in the last note of the pattern followed by a rest equal to the first part. Imperfect ordines are mostly theoretical and rare in practice, where perfect ordines predominate {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=223}}.

Other writers who covered the topic of rhythmic modes include Anonymous IV, who mentions the names of the composers Léonin and Pérotin as well as some of their major works, and [[Franco of Cologne]], writing around 1260, who recognized the limitations of the system and whose name became attached to the idea of representing the duration of a note by particular notational shapes, though in fact the idea had been known and used for some time before Franco {{harv|Hughes|1954b|loc=379–80}}. Lambertus described nine modes, and Anonymus IV said that, in England, a whole series of irregular modes was in use {{harv|Reece|1940|loc=288}}.

The letters S.P.I.T. is an [[acronym]] for Scale, Pattern, Inversion, and Triad and usually pertains to the first four chord types which include Major 7, Dominant 7, Minor 7, and Half-Diminished expressed in all twelve [[key signatures]]. The use of SPIT methodology involves matching the scale, pattern,inversion, and triad to the key signature of the song that requires improvisation. The methodology allows the musician to scan the SPIT page that matches the key signature of the song for improvisational embellishments that can be applied during rests or whole notes in the melody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usma.edu/Band/education/jazz.htm "An Introduction to Jazz Improvisation" by MSG Gary McCourry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Guitarplayer.com/article/conquering-giant-steps/aug-05/12678 "Conquering Giant Steps, Master Coltrane Harmony by Deconstructing One of the Most Revered and Feared Standards In jazz History" by Cory Christiansen]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">The '''safety life cycle''' is the series of phases from initiation and specifications of safety requirements, covering design and development of safety features in a [[safety-critical system]], and ending in decommissioning of that system. This article uses software as the context but the safety life cycle applies to other areas such as construction of buildings, for example. In software development, a process is used (software life cycle) and this process consists of a few phases, typically covering initiation, analysis, design, programming, testing and implementation. The focus is to build the software. Some software have safety concerns while others do not. For example, a Leave Application System does not have safety requirements. But we are concerned about safety if a software that is used to control the components in a plane fails. So for the latter, the question is how safety, being so important, should be managed within the software life cycle.

== What is the Safety Life Cycle? ==

The basic concept in building software safety, i.e. safety features in software, is that safety characteristics and behaviour of the software and system must be specified and designed into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alberico|first=David|title=Software System Safety Handbook|url=http://www.system-safety.org/Documents/Software_System_Safety_Handbook.pdf|publisher=Joint Services Software Safety Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem for any systems designer lies in reducing the risk to an acceptable level and of course, the risk tolerated will vary between applications. When a software application is to be used in a safety-related system, then this must be borne in mind at all stages in the software life cycle. The process of safety specification and assurance throughout the development and operational phases is sometimes called the ‘safety life cycle’.

== Phases in the Safety Life Cycle ==

The first stages of the life cycle involve assessing the potential system hazards and estimating the risk they pose. One such method is [[fault tree analysis]].

This is followed by a safety requirements specification which is concerned with identifying safety-critical functions (functional requirements specification) and the safety integrity level for each of these functions.&lt;ref name="Storey Safety"&gt;{{cite book|last=Storey|first=Neil|title=Safety-Critical Computer Systems|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|isbn=0-201-42787-7|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The specification may either describe how the software should behave to minimize the risk or might require that the hazard should never arise.  

A ‘normal’ process model is then followed with particular attention paid to the validation (inspection, testing etc.) of the system.  Part of that validation should be an explicit safety validation activity.

==Life==
She attended Fu Jen University in Taipei, Taiwan receiving a B.A. with a major in history and a minor in international trade. From 1986 to 1995, she studied at the University of Hamburg in Germany, obtaining a Master’s in art history and history with her thesis ''Das Porträt von [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] in [[Athanasius Kircher|Athanasius Kirchers]] ‘China illustrata’ (The Portrait of Johann Adam Schall von Bell in Athanasius Kircher’s ‘China illustrata’''). From 1996 until 2002, she studied at the Department of Art History of [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin, Germany where she received her PhD with her thesis ''The Image of China in Nature and Landscape of Athanasius Kircher’s ‘China illustrata’.

From 1988 to 1997, Chang worked as a journalist for the Taiwanese newspapers ''Independent Morning Post'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=潘家慶編 |title=報紙專文選輯 |journal=《新聞學研究》 |date=1990 |volume=春 |issue=42 |page=312 |url=http://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/word/5248302013.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Independence Evening Post|Independent Evening Post]]'' and ''Independent Weekly Post''. She wrote for magazines such as ''Artist'', ''ARTIMA'' and ''Art of Collection'' in Taipei and ''Nineties'' in Hong Kong. She was also a photographic reporter for the Taiwanese edition of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' and an editor for the German magazines ''Diskus'' and ''Pen'', which discusses topics including the development of art and culture in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sheng-Ching Chang - Publication of articles |url=https://fujenu.academia.edu/ShengChingChang/Publication-of-articles-%EF%BC%88%E5%A0%B1%E7%AB%A0%E8%A9%95%E8%AB%96%EF%BC%89 |website=Academia |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang worked as an Assistant Professor of history and art history at Fu Jen University, [[Taipei National University of Arts]] and [[National Taiwan University of Arts]] in Taipei from 2002 until 2006. She was later appointed Full Associate Professor (2009) and Full Professor (2016) at the History Department and Graduate Institute of [[Fu Jen University]]. In 2018, she was an Adjunct Professor at the Graduate Institute of Art History at [[National Taiwan Normal University]] in Taipei, Taiwan. Her research focus has been European art history in the global context, the history of artistic and cultural exchange between the East and the West, the methodology of art history and the history of colonial urban development.&lt;br&gt;

'''Social impact entertainment''' ('''SIE''') is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value.

The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of [[Entertainment-education]] which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/entertainment-education/|title=Entertainment-Education|date=2012-10-24|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "[[Impact producer|Impact Producers]]" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building.

[[Cinema of Change]] reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/the-cinema-of-change-ecosystem/|title=The Cinema of Change EcosystemThe Cinema of Change Ecosystem - Cinema of Change|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable being [[Participant Media]] due to its $100 million+ funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jmkdbrhlfK8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Tech Billionaires: Reshaping Philanthropy in a Quest for a Better World|last=Solomon|first=Lewis D.|date=2011-12-31|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412813747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Norman Lear Center]] and [[UCLA TFT]]'s Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.

{{for|the web design technique of combining images into a single bitmap to save memory|texture atlas}}

'''Sprite''' is a [[computer graphics]] term for a [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] [[bitmap]] that is integrated into a larger scene.

Originally sprites referred to independent objects that are composited together, by hardware, with other elements such as a background.&lt;ref name="dadgum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hague|first1=James|title=Why Do Dedicated Game Consoles Exist?|url=http://prog21.dadgum.com/181.html|website=dadgum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition occurs as each [[scan line]] is prepared for the video output device, such as a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]], without involvement of the main [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and without the need for a full-screen [[frame buffer]].&lt;ref name="dadgum"/&gt; Sprites can be positioned or altered by setting attributes used during the hardware composition process. Examples of systems with hardware sprites include the [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Sega Genesis]], and many coin-operated [[arcade machine]]s of the 1980s. Sprite hardware varies in how many sprites are supported, how many can be displayed on a single scan line (which is often a lower number), the dimensions and colors of each sprite, and special effects such as scaling or reporting pixel-precise overlap.

Use of the term ''sprite'' has expanded to refer to any two-dimensional bitmap used as part of a graphics display, even if drawn into a frame buffer (by either software or a [[GPU]]) instead of being composited on-the-fly at display time.

The act of manually creating sprites, as opposed to pre-rendering them or using digitized images, is a form of [[pixel art]]. It is sometimes referred to as ''spriting'', especially in the hobbyist community.

==History==
The use of sprites originated with [[arcade game]]s. The first video game to represent [[player character]]s as human player images was [[Taito]]'s ''[[List of Taito games|Basketball]]'', which was licensed in February 1974 to [[Midway Games|Midway]], releasing it as ''TV Basketball'' in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/video-game-firsts.html Video Game Firsts], The Golden Age Arcade Historian (November 22, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=wide-flyer&amp;db=videodb&amp;id=4036&amp;image=2 ''Basketball'' Flyer] (1974), Arcade Flyer Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Signetics]] devised the first chips capable of generating sprite graphics (referred to as ''objects'' by Signetics) for home systems. The Signetics 2636 video processors were first used in the 1978 [[1292 Advanced Programmable Video System]] and later in the 1979 [[Elektor TV Games Computer]].

The [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]], released in 1977, features a hardware sprite implementation where five graphical objects can be moved independently of the game playfield.  The term ''sprite'' was not in use at the time. The VCS's sprites are called ''movable objects'' in the programming manual, further identified as two ''players'', two ''missiles'', and one ''ball''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Steve|title=Stella Programmer's Guide|url=http://atarihq.com/danb/files/stella.pdf|date=December 3, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; These each consist of a single row of pixels that are displayed on a [[scan line]].  To produce a two-dimensional shape, the sprite's single-row bitmap is altered by software from one scan line to the next.

The 1979 [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400 and 800]] home computers feature similar, but more elaborate, circuitry capable of moving eight single-color objects per scan line: four 8-bit wide ''players'' and four 2-bit wide ''missiles''. Each is the full height of the display&amp;mdash;a long, thin strip. [[Direct memory access|DMA]] from a table in memory automatically sets the graphics pattern registers for each scan line. Hardware registers control the horizontal position of each player and missile. Vertical motion is achieved by moving the bitmap data within a player or missile's strip. The feature was called ''player/missile graphics'' by Atari.

The [[Namco Galaxian]] [[arcade system board]], for the 1979 arcade game ''[[Galaxian]]'', featured animated, multi-colored sprites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YVTNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|title=The Golden Age of Video Games: The Birth of a Multibillion Dollar Industry|first=Roberto|last=Dillon|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It pioneered a sprite system that animated pre-loaded sprites over a [[scrolling]] background, which became the basis for [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade hardware and [[home console]]s such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505103737/www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ Making the Famicom a Reality], ''Nikkei Electronics'' (September 12, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steve Golson from [[General Computer Corporation]], the term "stamp" was used instead of "sprite" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Steve Golson |date= |year=2016 |title=Classic Game Postmortem: 'Ms. Pac-Man' |trans-title= |medium=Conference |language=English |url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023366/Classic-Game-Postmortem-Ms-Pac |access-date=2017-01-26 |format= |time=20:30 |location= |publisher=[[Game Developers Conference]] |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=[…] 6 moving characters, what you would call today "sprites" we called them "stamps" back then, […].|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sprite'' was first used in the graphic sense by one of the definers of the [[Texas Instruments]] [[TMS9918|9918(A)]] video display processor (VDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.ti/msg/73e2451bcae4d91a |title=Karl Guttag Conference on Delphi TI Net - comp.sys.ti &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was derived from the fact that sprites, rather than being part of the bitmap data in the framebuffer, instead "floated" around on top without affecting the data in the framebuffer below, much like a ghost or "[[Sprite (folklore)|sprite]]". By this time, sprites had advanced to the point where complete two-dimensional shapes could be moved around the screen horizontally and vertically with minimal software overhead.

==Systems with hardware sprites==
These are base hardware specs and don't include additional programming techniques, such as using [[raster interrupt]]s to repurpose sprites mid-frame.

== Use in 3D rendering ==
{{original research|section|date=November 2016}}
2D images with alpha channels constrained to face the camera may be used in [[3D graphics]]. They are common for rendering vegetation, to approximate distant objects, or for [[particle effects]]. These are sometimes called "billboards" or "Z-sprites". If rendered on the fly to cache an approximate view of an underlying [[3D model]], such sprites are called ''impostors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPU Gems NVIDIA Developer|url=https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern GPU hardware can mimic sprites with two texture-mapped triangles or specific primitives such as [[point sprites]].

== Synonyms ==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2016}}
Some hardware makers used terms other than ''sprite''.

'''Player/Missile Graphics''' was a term used by [[Atari, Inc.]] for hardware-generated sprites in the company's early [[coin-op]] games, the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 5200|5200]] consoles, and the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]].&lt;ref name=dere&gt;{{cite web|title=De Re Atari|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/chapt04.php|website=archive.org|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term reflected the usage for both characters ("players") and smaller associated objects ("missiles") that share the same color.

&lt;span id="MOB"&gt;'''Movable Object Block''', or '''MOB'''&lt;/span&gt;, was used in [[MOS Technology]]'s graphics chip literature (data sheets, etc.) However, [[Commodore International|Commodore]], the main user of MOS chips and the owner of MOS for most of the chip maker's lifetime, used the term ''sprite'' for the Commodore 64.

The developer manuals for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and [[Game Boy]] refer to sprites as '''OBJ'''s (short for "objects"), and the region of RAM used to store sprite attributes and coordinates was known as '''OAM''' (Object Attribute Memory). This also applies on the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]] handheld systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19448">[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|The subaltern identity is conceptually derived from the cultural-hegemony work of the Italian Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci.]]

In [[critical theory]] and [[postcolonialism]], the term '''subaltern''' designates the populations which are socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of the [[colony]] and of the colonial [[homeland]]. In describing "history told from below", ''subaltern'' was coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]], notably through his work on [[cultural hegemony]], which identified the groups that are excluded from a society's established institutions and thus denied the means by which people have a voice in their society.

The terms ''subaltern'' and ''[[Subaltern Studies]]'' entered postcolonial studies through the works of the [[Subaltern Studies|Subaltern Studies Group]], a collection of historians of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] who explored the political-actor role of the men and women who constitute the mass population, rather than the political roles of the social and economic elites, in the history of the Indian Subcontinent. &lt;ref&gt;David Ludden (ed) ''Reading Subaltern Studies: Critical History, Contested Meaning and the Globalisation of South Asia''. Delhi: Permanent Black, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist historians]] had already been investigating colonial history as told from the perspective of the [[proletariat]], using the concept of social classes as being determined by economic relations. In the 1970s, ''subaltern'' began to denote the [[Colonization|colonized]] peoples of the Indian subcontinent and described a new perspective of the history of an [[Imperialism|imperial]] colony as told from the point of view of the colonized rather than that of the colonizers. In the 1980s, the scope of enquiry of Subaltern Studies was applied as an "intervention in South Asian [[historiography]]".

As a method of intellectual discourse, the concept of the ''subaltern'' is contentious because it originated as a [[Eurocentric]] method of historical enquiry for studying the non-Western people of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. From its inception as an historical-research model for studying the colonial experience of the  peoples  of the Indian Subcontinent, subaltern studies transformed from a model of intellectual discourse into a method of "vigorous post-colonial critique". The term "subaltern" is used in the fields of [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Prakash, Gyan. "Subaltern Studies as Postcolonial Criticism", ''The American Historical Review'', December, 1994,  Vol. 99, No. 5, 1475–1490, 1476.&lt;/ref&gt; [[musicology]], and art history.

== Denotations ==
In postcolonial theory, the term ''subaltern'' describes the lower classes and the social groups who are at the margins of a society: a subaltern is a person rendered without [[human agency|agency]] by [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert J. C. ''Postcolonialism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the literary critic [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]] spoke against an overly broad application of the term in 1992:

{{Quotation|...''subaltern'' is not just a classy word for "oppressed", for [the] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], for somebody who's not getting a piece of the pie.... In post-colonial terms, everything that has limited or no access to the cultural imperialism is subaltern—a space of difference. Now, who would say that's just the oppressed? The [[working class]] is oppressed. It's not subaltern.... Many people want to claim subalternity. They are the least interesting and the most dangerous. I mean, just by being a discriminated-against minority on the university campus; they don't need the word 'subaltern'.... They should see what the mechanics of the discrimination are. They're within the hegemonic discourse, wanting a piece of the pie, and not being allowed, so let them speak, use the hegemonic discourse. They should not call themselves subaltern.&lt;ref&gt;de Kock, Leon. "Interview With Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: New Nation Writers Conference in South Africa." ''[http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205400/http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 |date=2011-07-06 }}''. 23(3) 1992: 29-47. ARIEL&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Marxist theory]], the civil sense of the term ''subaltern'' was first used by the Italian communist intellectual [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937). In discussions of the meaning of the "subaltern" in Gramsci's writings, Spivak and others have argued that he used the word as a synonym for the proletariat (a [[code word]] to deceive the prison censor to allow his manuscripts out the prison),&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Stephen. "The Subaltern: Genealogy of a Concept", in ''Gayatri Spivak: Ethics, Subalternity and the Critique of Postcolonial Reason''. Malden, MA: Polity, 2007: pp. 96-97; and Hoare, Quintin, and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith. "Terminology", in ''Selections from the Prison Notebooks''. New York: International Publishers, pp. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; but that interpretation has been contested, with evidence indicating that it was a novel concept in Gramsci's political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Marcus E. "[https://www.academia.edu/1548708/Rethinking_the_subaltern_and_the_question_of_censorship_in_Gramscis_Prison_Notebooks Rethinking the Subaltern and the Question of Censorship in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks]," Postcolonial Studies, Volume 14, Number 4 (2011): 385-402.&lt;/ref&gt; In several essays, the postcolonial critic [[Homi K. Bhabha]] emphasized the importance of [[social power]] relations in defining subaltern social groups as oppressed, racial minorities whose social presence was crucial to the self-definition of the majority group; as such, subaltern social groups, nonetheless, also are in a position to subvert the [[authority]] of the social groups who hold hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Morena, Laura and Pfeiffer, Peter C. Eds. "Unsatisfied: Notes on Vernacular Cosmopolitanism", ''Text and Nation: Cross-Disciplinary Essays on Cultural and National Identities''. Columbia, SC: Camden House, 1996: pp. 191–207 and "Unpacking my library... again", ''The Post-colonial Question: Common Skies, Divided Horizons''. Iain Chambers, Lidia Curti, eds. New York: Routledge, 1996: 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Toward a New Legal Common Sense'' (2002), the sociologist [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]] applies the term ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' to describe the counter-hegemonic practice, social movement, resistance, and struggle against [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]], especially the struggle against [[social exclusion]]. Moreover, de Sousa Santos applies ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' as interchangeable with the term ''cosmopolitan legality'' to describe the diverse [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] framework for an ''equality of differences'' in which the term ''subaltern'' specifically denotes the oppressed peoples at the margins of a society who are struggling against hegemonic globalization. However, context, time, and place (but perhaps not the Marxist emphasis on the economic relations) determine who, among the peoples at the margins of a society, is a Subaltern; in India women, [[dalit]]s, rural, tribal, immigrant laborers are part of subaltern.

== Theory ==
Postcolonial theory studies the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and the continued dominance of Western ways of knowing, of intellectual enquiry. The work of [[Edward Said]] in the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' conceptually addresses oppressed subaltern peoples, to explain how the Eurocentric perspective of Orientalism produced the foundations and the justifications for the [[dominance hierarchy|domination]] of [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]], by means of colonialism. Before their explorations of ''The Orient'', the Europeans had created an imagined geography of the Orient, predefined images of savage and monstrous places that lay beyond the horizon of the known world. During their initial Oriental explorations, the Europeans' mythologies were reinforced, when the travellers returned to Europe with reports of monsters and savage lands. The concepts of the "difference" and the "strangeness" of the Orient were perpetuated through the mass communications media of the time and through discourse that created an "Us" and "Them" binary social relation with which the Europeans defined themselves by defining the differences of the Orient from the Occident, the European West. The Us-and-Them binary social relation was a foundation of colonialism, because it represented the Orient as backward and irrational lands, and, therefore, in need of European help to become modern, in the Western sense. Hence, the [[discourse]] of Orientalism is Eurocentric, and does not seek to include the voices of the Oriental peoples, the subalterns, themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings'' by T. Das Gupta, ''et al.'' (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne. ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', chapter 1, On Orientalism. SAGE Publications. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] argued that the power of discourse created and reinforced Western dominance. The discourses on how Europe described differences between itself (The West) and others, used European cultural categories, languages, and ideas to represent "The Other." The knowledge produced by such a discourse becomes praxis, which then becomes reality; by producing a discourse of "[[Difference (philosophy)|difference]]" Europe was able to maintain its dominance over "The Other", with a binary social relation between the European and The Other, thereby creating and establishing the Subaltern, made possible by excluding The Other from the production of the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. "The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power". ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings''. Das Gupta, T. et al (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The voice of the subaltern ==
[[Image:Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak at Goldsmiths College.jpg|thumb|175px|Engaging the Subaltern voice: the philosopher and theorist Gayatri Spivak.]]

[[Gayatri Spivak]]'s line of reasoning was developed in Joanne Sharp's ''Geographies of Post colonialism'' (2008), who proposed that Western intellectuals relegate other, non-Western (African, Asian, Middle Eastern) forms of "knowing", of acquiring knowledge of the world, to the margins of intellectual discourse, by re-formulating these forms of knowing as myth and as folklore. To be heard and known, the subaltern must adopt Western ways of knowing, of thought, reasoning, and language; because of such [[Westernization]], a subaltern people can never express their ways of knowing (thought, reasoning, language) and instead must conform expression of their non-Western knowledge of colonial life to Western ways of knowing the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne  ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', Chapter 6: Can the Subaltern Speak? SAGE Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Subalterns' abandonment of culturally customary ways of thinking and the subsequent adoption of Western ways of thinking are necessary in many situations. The subordinated can be heard by oppressors only by speaking the language of the rulers; thus, intellectual and cultural filters of conformity muddle the true voice of the subaltern. For example, in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Colonial Latin America]], non-elites must conform to the colonial culture and use the filters of religion and servitude, in the language, when addressing the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Imperial]] rulers. To make their appeals to the crown effective, slaves and natives would address the rulers in ways that might mask their own ways of speaking.

Early modern historian [[Fernando Coronil]] said that the goal of the investigator must be "to listen to the subaltern subjects, and to interpret what I hear" and to engage them and interact with their voices. We cannot ascend to a position of dominance over the voice, subjugating its words to the meanings we desire to attribute to them. That is simply another form of discrimination. The power to narrate somebody's story is a heavy task, and we must be cautious and aware of the complications involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coronil|first=Fernando|title=Listening to the Subaltern: The Poetics of Neocolonial States|jstor=1773104|journal=Poetics Today|year=1994|volume=15|issue=4|series=4|pages=643–658|doi=10.2307/1773104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spivak and [[bell hooks]] question the academic's engagement with the Other, and argue that, to truly engage with the subaltern, the academic would have to remove him or herself as "the expert" at the center of the Us-and-Them binary social relation. Traditionally, the academic wants to know about the subaltern's experiences of colonialism, but does not want to know the subaltern's (own) explanation of his or her experiences of colonial domination.  According to the received view in Western knowledge, hooks argued that a true explanation can come only from the expertise of the academic, thus, the subordinated subject, the subaltern surrender knowledge of colonialism for the use of the Western academic; hooks describes the relationship between the academic and the subaltern:

{{Quotation|[There is] no need to hear your voice, when I can talk about you better than you can speak about yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only tell me about your pain. I want to know your story. And then I will tell it back to you in a new way. Tell it back to you in such a way that it has become mine, my own. Re-writing you, I write myself anew. I am still author, authority. I am still [the] colonizer, the speaking subject, and you are now at the center of my talk.|"Marginality as a Site of Resistance" (1990)&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "Marginality as a Site of Resistance", in R. Ferguson et al. (eds), ''Out There: Marginalization and Contemporary Cultures''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1990: pp. 241-43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a means of constructing a greater historical picture of society, the Subaltern's story is a revealing examination of society; the perspective of the subaltern man and woman, the most powerless people who live within colonial confines; therefore, the investigator of post-colonialism must not assume a lumbering cultural superiority in the course of studying the voices of the oppressed subalterns.

== Development discourse ==
Mainstream development discourse, which is based upon knowledge of colonialism and [[Orientalism]], concentrates upon [[modernization theory]], wherein the modernization of an underdeveloped country ''should'' follow the path to modernization taken (and established) by the developed countries of the West. As such, modernization is characterized by free trade, open markets, capitalist economic systems, and democratic systems of governance, as the means by which a nation should modernize their country ''en route'' to becoming a developed country in the Western style. Therefore, mainstream development discourse concentrates upon the application of universal social and political, economic and cultural policies that would nationally establish such modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson"&gt;Lawson, Victoria. ''Making Development Geography''. UK: Hodder Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Making Development Geography'' (2007), Victoria Lawson presents a critique of mainstream development discourse as mere recreation of the Subaltern, which is effected by means of the subaltern being disengaged from other social scales, such as the locale and the community; not considering regional, social class, ethnic group, sexual- and gender-class differences among the peoples and countries being modernized; the continuation of the socio-cultural treatment of the subaltern as a subject of development, as a subordinate who is ignorant of what to do and how to do it; and by excluding the voices of the subject peoples from the formulations of policy and practice used to effect the modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

As such, the subaltern are peoples who have been silenced in the administration of the colonial states they constitute, they can be heard by means of their political actions, effected in protest against the [[discourse]] of mainstream development, and, thereby, create their own, proper forms of modernization and development. Hence do subaltern social groups create social, political, and cultural movements that contest and disassemble the exclusive claims to power of the Western imperialist powers, and so establish the use and application of local knowledge to create new spaces of opposition and alternative, non-imperialist futures.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

The '''Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study''' (SCAS) is an institute for advanced study in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]]. It is one of the nine member institutions of the [[Some Institutes for Advanced Study]] consortium, which brings together the world's most distinguished institutes for advanced study.

The Collegium was founded in 1985, chartered by the Swedish government and offers one-semester and one-year fellowships to visiting scholars, ranging from postdoctoral to professorial positions. Since January 2007, it is located in the [[Linneanum]] in the [[Uppsala University Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://regler.uu.se/digitalAssets/100/100790_budgetunderlag-uu-2008-2010.pdf Uppsala Universitet: Budgetunderlag 2008-2010, bil. 5, p. 1]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier located in a villa in the Kåbo district of Uppsala.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">'''Tokyo tanks''' were internally mounted [[self-sealing fuel tanks]] used in the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943%20-%202651.html Drop Tanks] November 4th, 1943 ''Flight'' p513&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]]. Although nicknamed "[[Tokyo]]" tanks to dramatically illustrate the significant range they added to the B-17 (approximately 40% greater with combat weights), it was also an exaggeration in that no B-17 ever had the range to bomb [[Japan]] from any base in World War II.

== Description ==
These fuel tanks consisted of eighteen removable rubberized-compound containers, called cells, installed inside the main wings of the airplane, nine to each side. The main wings of the B-17 consisted of an "inboard wing" structural panel mounted to the fuselage and mounting the [[engines]] and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], and an "outboard wing" structural panel joined to the inboard wing and carrying only the [[aileron]]s. The Tokyo tanks were installed on either side of the joint (a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] point) where the two wing portions were connected. Five cells, totalling {{convert|270|USgal|L}} capacity, sat side by side in the outboard wing and were joined by a fuel line to the main tank delivering fuel to the outermost engine. The sixth cell was located in the space where the wing sections joined, with the remaining three cells located side-by-side within the inboard wing, and these four cells delivered {{convert|270|USgal|L}} of fuel to the feeder tank for the inboard engine. The same arrangement was repeated on the opposite wing. The Tokyo tanks added {{convert|1,080|USgal|L}} of fuel to the {{convert|1,700|USgal|L}} carried in the six regular wing tanks and the {{convert|820|USgal|L}} that could be carried in a tank that could be mounted in the bomb bay, for a combined total of {{convert|3,600|USgal|L}}.

All B-17F aircraft built by Boeing from Block 80, by [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]] from Block 25, and by [[Vega Aircraft Company|Vega]] from Block 30 were equipped with Tokyo tanks, and the entire run of B-17Gs had Tokyo tanks. These B-17s with factory-mounted Tokyo tanks were first introduced to the [[Eighth Air Force]] in [[England]] in April 1943 with the arrival of the 94th and 95th Bomb Groups. In June 1943 aircraft that were so equipped began to appear in greater numbers as replacement aircraft, and from the beginning of July, 1943, all replacement aircraft that did not have the tanks were equipped before issue.

Although the tanks were removable, this could only be done by first removing the outboard wing panel, and so was not a routine maintenance task. A drawback to the tanks was that there was no means of measuring remaining fuel quantity within the cells. Fuel was moved from the cells to the engine tanks by opening control [[valve]]s within the bomb bay so that the fuel drained by gravity. Although the tanks were specified as self-sealing, vapor buildup within partially drained tanks made them explosive hazards in combat.

'''The Graduate School of Education and Information Studies (GSE&amp;IS)''' is one of the professional graduate schools at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Located in [[Los Angeles, California]], the school combines two distinguished departments whose research and doctoral training programs are committed to expanding the range of knowledge in [[education]], [[information science]], and associated disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/ "Welcome to GSE&amp;IS"] UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1881, the school is the oldest unit at [[UCLA]], having been founded as a [[normal school]] prior to the establishment of the university. It was incorporated into the [[University of California]] in 1919. The school offers a wide variety of doctoral and master's degrees, including the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[M.Ed.]], [[Master of Library and Information Science|M.L.I.S.]], [[Ed.D.]], and [[Ph.D.]], as well as professional certificates and credentials in education and information studies. It also hosts visiting scholars and a number of research centers, institutes, and programs.

Both of its departments have consistently ranked highly among graduate schools of education and Master's of Library and Information Science by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' in every year in which the magazine has published such rankings. ''U.S. News and World Report'' does not rank doctoral programs in information studies, but the information studies faculty consistently ranks among the most productive and highly cited faculty in its field, according to a standard quadrennial peer-reviewed study by professors within that field.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Denice and Budd, John. "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty."

==Location==
Because of the school's size, GSE&amp;IS is located in three buildings on the UCLA campus in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]]. Moore Hall primarily houses the school's administration and education faculty. Built in 1930 and designed by [[George W. Kelham]], Moore Hall is among the most architecturally significant buildings at UCLA, an example of the school's original [[Romanesque Revival]] style. During the campus' expansion during the 1950s, the [[modernist]] architect [[Kemper Nomland]] refurbished Moore Hall. The building was again refurbished by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm Robert Englekirk &amp; Associates in 1993. Moore Hall is located directly south of [[Powell Library]], adjacent to [[Bruin Walk]], Kerkhoff Hall and Ackerman Union, in the middle of campus.&lt;ref name="UCLA Buildings"&gt;[http://www.aim.ucla.edu/prof02/bldgs.pdf UCLA Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mathematical Sciences Building (popularly known as "Math Sciences") houses some of the school's research centers, programs, and institutes, in addition to the administrative and faculty offices of the Mathematical Sciences. The building was built in 1957 and designed by Stanton &amp; Stockwell in the mid-century [[modernist]] style. The Mathematical Sciences Building is located in the middle of campus, directly south of Moore Hall, at the north-west corner of the Court of Sciences.&lt;ref name="UCLA Buildings"/&gt; The GSE&amp;IS Building primarily houses the information studies faculty and computer and research labs. Built in 1991, the building is located in the northern part of the UCLA campus, off [[Sunset Boulevard]], directly adjacent to the [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA's main research library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.admin.ucla.edu/space_plsql/pkg_gui.home?body=pkg_gui.campus%3Fp_loc_id=366 GSEIS Building]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies can trace its history back to a state legislative act in 1881 that established a "southern branch" of the [[California State Normal School]] in [[Los Angeles]]. When it opened in 1882 (on what is now the site of the Central Library of the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] system), its primary responsibility was teacher training. The Department of Education was established in 1894. The school was renamed the Los Angeles State Normal School in 1914, and in 1917 the school was moved to a larger site on [[Vermont Avenue]] (on what is now the site of [[Los Angeles City College]]). The new facility included an [[elementary school]] where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children. That same year Ernest Carroll Moore (for whom Moore Hall is named) was appointed its director. The [[University of California]] opened its [[Southern Branch of the University of California|southern branch]] in 1919 by replacing the Los Angeles State Normal School with the University's Teachers College. A southern branch of the College of Letters and Science, which enrolled considerably fewer students than the Teachers College, was also established as part of the campus. Moore became director of the southern campus (later [[Provost (education)|provost]]) and [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the Teachers College, a position he held until 1939. The campus moved to its current location in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="sunsite.berkeley.edu"&gt;Los Angeles: Schools and Colleges.

[[File:Moore Hall West Side.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Moore Hall west side entrance]]
In 1930 Los Angeles City Librarian Everett R. Perry proposed to the president of the [[University of California]] the establishment of a library school on the Los Angeles campus of the University. By 1935 the School of Librarianship was opened at the University's campus at Berkeley (now the [[UC Berkeley School of Information]]), which was later suspended through [[World War II]]. UCLA University Librarian [[Lawrence Clark Powell]], among other Los Angeles leaders, resumed the prewar interest in a library school at UCLA. The [[Regents of the University of California]] approved the establishment of the school in 1958. Powell (for whom [[Powell Library]] is named) resigned his position as University Librarian to become [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the new school. The school was established with collaboration from the School of Librarianship at Berkeley. The two schools initially created a single alumni association and doctoral students took courses, when appropriate, at either campus.&lt;ref name="sunsite.berkeley.edu"/&gt; From its inception the school hired faculty from other disciplines, namely mathematician [[Robert M. Hayes]]. With innovation in [[information technology]] after [[World War II]], library programs became increasingly multidisciplinary, effectively providing a disciplinary home for the interdisciplinary study of [[information science]]. Many library schools have since been repositioned as [[information schools]], schools of information science, or schools of library and information science. ''See the [[Information science#History|history of information science]].''

The School of Education and the School of Library and Information Science were incorporated into the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies in 1994. UCLA is the only major research university in the country that combines these two areas of study into a single school or college.&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/news/facts.html GSE&amp;IS Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2014, Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco became the inaugural Wasserman Dean of Education &amp; Information Studies. The Wasserman Endowed Deanship of Education &amp; Information Studies is made possible by the Wasserman Foundation. It marks a historic milestone for the graduate school and the university as it establishes the very first endowed deanship at UCLA. “This gift from the Wasserman Foundation reflects its investment in both UCLA and Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco as transformative leaders in education for greater Los Angeles and beyond,” UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated.

===Department of Education===

Consistently ranked within the top ten [[Graduate School|graduate]] [[School of Education|schools of education]] by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'',&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/edu/brief/edurank_brief.php "Top Education Programs"] ''U.S. News and World Report.'' Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Education is committed to understanding and improving education practice in a diverse society. The Department of Education is UCLA's oldest unit, since UCLA was founded as a [[normal school]] for the training of teachers. Divisions within the Department of Education include Urban Schooling, Student Affairs, Educational Leadership, Higher Education and Organizational Change, Human Development and Psychology (formerly Psychological Studies in Education), Social Research Methodology, Social Sciences and Comparative Education, among others. The program offers both a [[Masters degree|Masters]] (awarded after one year of study) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program. The department is especially known for its research in the study of student testing and assessment, teacher and continuing education and development - particularly in urban, multi-ethnic environments, early childhood development, and issues of access, equity and quality facing higher education.&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"/&gt; The department is home to [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing]] (CRESST), the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] (HERI), [[The Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles]] (CRP/PDC), the UC All Campus Consortium On Research and Diversity (UC ACCORD), and the Center for International and Development Education (CIDE), among others.

===Department of Information Studies===

Accredited by the [[American Library Association]] and a founding member of the [[I-Schools]] caucus, the Department of Information Studies ranks the 4th most productive and 3rd most highly cited faculty in the latest Budd survey of "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty" (as measured per capita of faculty).&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Denice and Budd, John. "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty." ''Library &amp; Information Science Research'' 28.3 (Autumn 2006):374-389. John Budd is a professor in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, [[University of Missouri]]. In 2000 Budd published rankings in ''[[Library Journal]]'' 70.2 (April 2000):230; UCLA ranked 8th and 3rd respectively. In 1996 Budd published rankings in ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' 6.1 (1996):1-20; UCLA ranked 1st and 2nd respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranks the Master's of Library Science program among the top 13 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/library.html "Top Programs in Library and Information Studies"] ''U.S. News and World Report.'' Retrieved December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, the Department of Information Studies examines the application, communication, processing, representation and social consequences of technology. It also studies the structure, behavior, and interactions of natural and engineered computational systems. Traditionally, it is concerned with the gathering, manipulation, classification, storage, and retrieval of recorded knowledge. The central notion is the transformation and dissemination of information - whether by computation or communication, whether by organisms or artifacts. In this sense, it is more or less a merge of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computing science, and related fields. The UCLA Department of Information Studies is regarded for its cultural studies and social justice approach to Information Studies.

The department offers an undergraduate program in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]; the [[Masters degree|Masters]] in [[Library and Information Science]] (awarded after two years of study), which has three focus areas: Library Studies, Archival Studies, and [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]; the [[PhD]] in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]; and the Moving Image Archive Studies [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], an inter-departmental program jointly sponsored by the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], and the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media in the [[UCLA School of Theater Film and Television]]. The department is home to the California Center for the Book, a division of the [[Center for the Book]], the Center for Information as Evidence, and the California Rare Book School, among many other institutes, programs, and research centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/research/ "Research at GSE&amp;IS."] UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is known for having a diverse teaching faculty who come from many countries around the world. There are also many adjunct faculty members who teach at the school which adds some vocational instruction to the highly theoretical program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">In [[manufacturing]], an '''undercut''' is a special type of recessed surface. In [[turning]], it refers to a recess in a diameter. In [[machining]], it refers to a recess in a corner. In [[molding (process)|molding]], it refers to a feature that cannot be molded using only a single pull mold. In [[printed circuit board]], construction it refers to the portion of the copper that is [[etching (microfabrication)|etched]] away under the [[photoresist]]. In [[welding]], it refers to undesired melting and removal of metal near the weld bead. 

==Turning==
[[File:Undercut turning.png|thumb|400px|An example of a turned part with and without an undercut]]

On turned parts an undercut is also known as a ''neck'' or "relief groove". They are often used at the end of the threaded portion of a shaft or [[screw]] to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as ''thread relief'' in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least {{convert|0.015|in|mm|abbr=on}} smaller than the [[minor diameter]] of the thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Thread relief and chamfers | url = http://www.pmpa.org/technology/design/threadrelief.htm | work = PMPA's Designer's Guide | publisher = Precision Machined Products Association | accessdate = 2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread.  Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter.  They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on [[technical drawing]]s by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2004|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molding==
[[File:Ondersnijding.gif|thumb|left|A simple example of molding an external undercut]]
Undercut - Any indentation or protrusion in a shape that will prevent its withdrawal from a one-piece mold.

Undercuts on molded parts are features that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an [[injection molding machine]]. They are categorized into ''internal'' and ''external'' undercuts, where external undercuts are on the exterior of the part and interior undercuts are on the inside of the part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a ''[[side action]]'' or ''side pull''.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt; This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berins|Society of the Plastics Industry|1991|pp=325–326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosato|Plastics Institute of America|Schott|Rosato|2001|pp=1405–1406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the size of the undercut is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of [[stripper pin]]s so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Milling==
[[File:Undercut machining.png|thumb|400px|An example of a machining undercut]]

In milling the corners may be undercut to remove the radius that is usually left by the [[milling cutter]]. Examples of this use are linear bearings for square shafts (i.e. [[rack and pinion|racks]]) and machined hexalobular sockets.

{{clear}}

==Etching==
[[File:Etch anisotropy.png|thumb|left|upright|{{ordered list |An isotropic etchant that creates an undercut |An anisotropic etchant leaves no undercut}}]]
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}

Undercuts from etching are somewhat different than the undercuts explained above, because it is a side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the [[Chemical milling|etchant]] was applied too long. The second is due to an [[isotropic]] etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an [[anisotropic]] etchant is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=897}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Welding==
[[File:Welding undercut.svg|thumb]]

Undercutting is when the weld reduces the cross-sectional thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces the strength of the weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression along the length of the weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough [[filler metal]] along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater [[temperature gradient]]s between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rampaul|2003|pp=211–212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
