      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="948">An '''abuse prevention program''' is a social program designed to help [[parent]]s and [[teacher]]s recognize the signs of violence in an [[Child abuse|abused child]] and teaches how to explain abuse protection to them. These programs also help children in establishing [[self-esteem]].

An alternate definition of '''abuse prevention programme''' describes those projects which identify risk indicators such as [[poverty]], poor housing, inadequate educational facilities etc. and aim to reduce the impact of such indicators, either through social reform or through developing parents and children's coping strategies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">'''Algorithmic transparency''' is the principle that the factors that influence the decisions made by [[algorithms]] should be visible, or transparent, to the people who use, regulate, and are impacted by systems that employ those algorithms. Although the phrase was coined in 2016 by Nicholas Diakopoulos and Michael Koliska about the role of algorithms in deciding the content of digital journalism services&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Diakopoulos &amp; Michael Koliska (2016): Algorithmic Transparency in the News Media, Digital Journalism, DOI: 10.1080/21670811.2016.1208053&lt;/ref&gt;, the underlying principle dates back to the 1970s and the rise of automated systems for scoring consumer credit.

The phrases "algorithmic transparency" and "algorithmic accountability"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diakopoulos|first1=Nicholas|title=Algorithmic Accountability: Journalistic Investigation of Computational Power Structures.|journal=Digital Journalism|date=2015|volume=3|issue=3|page=398-415}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used interchangeably – especially since they were coined by the same people – but they have subtly different meanings. Specifically, "algorithmic transparency" states that the inputs to the algorithm and the algorithm's use itself must be known, but they need not be fair.  "Algorithmic accountability" implies that the organizations that use algorithms must be accountable for the decisions made by those algorithms, even though the decisions are being made by a machine, and not by a human being.&lt;ref name="Dickey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickey|first1=Megan Rose|title=Algorithmic Accountability|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/30/algorithmic-accountability/|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=TechCrunch|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current research around algorithmic transparency interested in both societal effects of accessing remote services running algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop on Data and Algorithmic Transparency|url=http://datworkshop.org/|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as mathematical and computer science approaches that can be used to achieve algorithmic transparency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning|url=http://www.fatml.org/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s Bureau of Consumer Protection studies how algorithms are used by consumers by conducting its own research on algorithmic transparency and by funding external research.&lt;ref name="Noyes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noyes|first1=Katherine|title=The FTC is worried about algorithmic transparency, and you should be too|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2908372/the-ftc-is-worried-about-algorithmic-transparency-and-you-should-be-too.html|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=PCWorld|date=9 April 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], the data protection laws that came into effect in May 2018 include a "right to explanation" of decisions made by algorithms, though it is unclear what this means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=False Testimony |journal=Nature |date=31 May 2018 |volume=557 |issue=7707 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''altruism''' refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name="Bell2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: The Mechanism of Evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruism in this sense is different from the philosophical concept of altruism, in which an action would only be called "altruistic" if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. In the behavioural sense, there is no such requirement. As such, it is not evaluated in moral terms—it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action is considered altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.&lt;ref name="Okasha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/|title=Biological altruism|author=Okasha, S.|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term altruism was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of egoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from an Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning "other people" or "somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruistic behaviours appear most obviously in [[Kin selection|kin relationships]], such as in parenting, but may also be evident among wider social groups, such as in social insects. They allow an individual to increase the success of its genes by helping relatives that share those genes.&lt;ref name="DaviesKrebs2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas B. Davies|author2=John R. Krebs|author3=Stuart A. West|title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9mXO5asWi8C|date=April 9, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3949-9|pages=307–333|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obligate altruism is the permanent loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain). For example, honey bee workers may forage for the colony. Facultative altruism is temporary loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain followed by personal reproduction); for example, a [[Florida scrub jay]] helping at the nest, then gaining parental territory.&lt;ref&gt;{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR by John Alcock 9th edition}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of behavior), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], on occasion, some animals do behave in ways that reduce their individual fitness but increase the fitness of other individuals in the population; this is a functional definition of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Robert L. Trivers]] | title = The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism | journal = [[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 1
 | year = 1971 | page = 35 | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2822435?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101295513123 | doi = 10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in [[evolutionary theory]] has been applied to social behaviour, including altruism. Cases of animals helping individuals to whom they are closely related can be explained by [[kin selection]], and are not considered true altruism. Beyond the physical exertions that in some species mothers and in some species fathers undertake to protect their young, extreme examples of sacrifice may occur. One example is [[matriphagy]] (the consumption of the mother by her offspring) in the spider ''[[Stegodyphus]]''; another example is a male spider allowing a female fertilized by him to eat him. [[Hamilton's rule]] describes the benefit of such altruism in terms of [[Sewall Wright|Wright's]] [[coefficient of relationship]] to the beneficiary and the benefit granted to the beneficiary minus the cost to the sacrificer. Should this sum be greater than zero a fitness gain will result from the sacrifice.

When apparent altruism is not between kin, it may be based on [[reciprocal altruism|reciprocity]]. A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed. Such reciprocity will pay off, in evolutionary terms, as long as the costs of helping are less than the benefits of being helped and as long as animals will not gain in the long run by "cheating"—that is to say, by receiving favours without returning them. This is elaborated on in [[evolutionary game theory]] and specifically the [[prisoner's dilemma]] as social theory.

==Implications in evolutionary theory==
[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right| 250 px|Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils.]]
The existence of altruism in nature is at first sight puzzling, because altruistic behaviour reduces the likelihood that an individual will reproduce. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The idea that ''[[group selection]]'' might explain the evolution of altruism was first broached by Darwin himself in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]], (1871). The concept of group selection has had a chequered and controversial history in evolutionary biology but the uncritical 'good of the species' tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due largely to the work of [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams, G.C.]] (1972) [[Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought]].

(2012). [http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection The False Allure of Group Selection].  Edge,  Jun 19, 2012.  http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection&lt;/ref&gt; These evolutionary theorists pointed out that [[natural selection]] acts on the individual, and that it is the individual's fitness (number of offspring and grand-offspring produced compared to the rest of the population) that drives evolution. A group advantage (e.g. hunting in a pack) that is disadvantageous to the individual (who might be harmed during the hunt, when it could avoid injury by hanging back from the pack but still share in the spoils) cannot evolve, because the selfish individual will leave, on average, more offspring than those who join the pack and suffer injuries as a result. If the selfishness is hereditary, this will ultimately result in the population consisting entirely of selfish individuals. However, in the 1960s and 1970s an alternative to the "group selection" theory emerged. This was the [[kin selection]] theory, due originally to [[W. D. Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour, I and II. | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–16, 17–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kin selection is an instance of [[inclusive fitness]], which is based on the notion that an individual shares only half its genes with each offspring, but also with each full [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] (See footnote{{#tag:ref |An individual's gene complement (or genome) can be represented by the letters of the alphabet. Each letter is represented twice: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The subscript indicates from which parent that copy of A has come. Mostly the two copies are identical, but occasionally they differ slightly.

When this individual reproduces sexually, one or other copy of A (chosen randomly) is passed on to offspring-1, who gets its other copy of A from the sexual partner. The same happens with genes B, C, D …. Z. If we denote the two sexual partners by means of  subscripts "m" and "f", then the genome of the offspring they produce might consist of A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/B&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt; …… Z&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each parent has contributed exactly half of the offspring's genome. So individual "m" shares only half of its genome with its offspring.
Suppose individuals "m" and "f" produce a second offspring (offspring-2), whose genome is determined in exactly the same manner. For this example, suppose their genome consists of 52 genes. There is a coin-flip 50% probability that offspring-2 will inherit the same copy of A from "m" as offspring-1 did (i.e. A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;). This also applies to gene B and so on through the alphabet. If a coin-flip "heads" means that gene X is the same in offspring-1 as it is in offspring-2, then in 26 flips of the coin, approximately half are going to be "heads", and the rest "tails", i.e. half the genes inherited from parent "m" will be the same in the two offspring. The same will happen to the genes inherited from parent "f". Thus of the 52 genes inherited from the two parents, on average, 13&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;26 (or half) will be identical in the two sibs.
Thus sibs are genetically as similar to one another as a parent is to an offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. (1984) Natural selection, kin selection and group selection. In Krebs, J.R. &amp; Davies, N.B. (Eds.) ‘' Behavioural Ecology. An Evolutionary Approach.'' (p. 70-71). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications. {{ISBN|0632009985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maynardsmith&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics.|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=173–175|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations. }}&lt;/ref&gt; |group=nb}}). From an evolutionary genetic point of view it is therefore as advantageous to help with the upbringing of full sibs as it is to produce and raise one's own offspring. The two activities are evolutionarily entirely equivalent. Co-operative breeding (i.e. helping one's parents raise sibs—provided they are full sibs) could thus evolve without the need for group-level selection. This  quickly gained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of social behaviour.&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt;

In 1971 [[Robert Trivers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1086/406755|last=Trivers|first= R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology| volume= 46|pages= 35–57|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced his [[reciprocal altruism]] theory to explain the evolution of helping at the nest of an unrelated breeding pair of birds. He argued that an individual might act as a helper if there was a high probabilistic expectation of being helped by the recipients at some later date. If, however, the recipients did not reciprocate when it was possible to do so, the altruistic interaction with these recipients would be permanently terminated. But if the recipients did not cheat then the reciprocal altruism would continue indefinitely to both parties' advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Emlen, S.T. (1984) Cooperative breeding in birds and mammals.

However, Trivers did make reference to the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma Game]] which, 10 years later, would restore interest in Trivers' reciprocal altruism theory, but under the title of "tit-for-tat".&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7466396|last1=Axelrod |first1=R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=W.D.|year = 1981 | title = The evolution of cooperation|url = | journal = Science |volume = 211 | issue =|pages = 1390–1396 |pmid =7466396|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The "[[Game theory|game]]" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) ("cooperation") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is  unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG:  two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behaviour: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy.&lt;ref name=sigmund&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigmund|first1 =K.|title=Games of Life.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=|pages=180–206|url= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances.

However, in 1981 Axelrod and Hamilton&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt; noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (the so-called Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by Robert Triver's reciprocal altruism theory) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism.&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt;&lt;ref name=sigmund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=168–169, 181–183|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "tit-for-tat" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, "generous tit-for-tat", which behaves like "tit-for-tat", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was "betray".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Godfray, H.C.J. | title = The evolution of forgiveness | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue =  |date=1992 | pages = 206–207 | doi =  10.1038/355206a0| pmid =|bibcode = 1992Natur.355..206G }}&lt;/ref&gt;), but all can be outperformed by at least one of the other strategies, should one of the players switch to such a strategy.

In the light of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game failing to provide a full answer to the evolution of cooperation or altruism, several alternative explanations have been proposed.

There are striking parallels between altruistic acts and exaggerated [[Sexual selection|sexual ornaments]] displayed by some animals, particularly certain bird species, such as, amongst others, the [[Peafowl|peacock]]. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led [[Amotz Zahavi]] to suggest that both might be [[Signalling theory|fitness signals]] rendered evolutionarily stable by his [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1975 |title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zahavi&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1977 |title=The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle) |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3 |pmid=904334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-510035-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, [[Signalling theory#The sports handicapping metaphor|the signal]] has to be evolutionarily costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1990 |title=Biological signals as handicaps |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=517–546 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80088-8 |pmid=2402153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=RA |first2=A |last2=Grafen |year=1993 |title=Dishonesty and the handicap principle |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=759H. Carl 764 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahavi borrowed the term "handicap principle" from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]], provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in [[Golf handicap|amateur golf]], better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by its increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is its health. An altruistic act is, by definition, similarly costly. It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case altruism is evolutionarily stabilized by [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=zahavi /&gt;

There is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a [[Silent mutation|non-silent]] [[mutation]] will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through [[natural selection]], while less adaptive attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher R. (1930) ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to [[Koinophilia|prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features]].&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D.

Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviours will also be rendered [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]], including any altruistic, cooperative and social characteristics. Thus, in the example of the selfish individual who hangs back from the rest of the hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate.&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt; Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.&lt;ref name=koeslag1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=koeslag3&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00188-7|last1 = Koeslag|first1 = J.H.| year = 2003 |title = Evolution of cooperation: cooperation defeats defection in the cornfield model |url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume = 224 |issue = | pages = 399–410 |pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reciprocity mechanisms ==
Altruism in animals describes a range of behaviors performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/altruism |title=Altruism &amp;#124; Define Altruism at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs and benefits are measured in terms of reproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself, but boosts the likelihood that other organisms are to produce offspring. There are other forms of altruism in nature other than risk-taking behavior, such as reciprocal altruism. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday human concept. For humans, an action would only be called 'altruistic' if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. Yet in the biological sense there is no such requirement. Instead, until we can communicate directly with other species, an accurate theory to describe altruistic acts between species is Biological Market Theory.
Humans and other animals exchange benefits in several ways, known technically as reciprocity mechanism. No matter what the mechanism, the common thread is that benefits find their way back to the original giver.

=== Symmetry-based ===
Also known as the "buddy-system", mutual affection between two parties prompts similar behavior in both directions without need to track of daily give-and-take, so long as the overall relationship remains satisfactory. This is one of the most common mechanism of reciprocity in nature, this kind is present in humans, primates, and many other mammals.

=== Attitudinal ===
Also known as, "If you're nice, I'll be nice too." This mechanism of reciprocity is similar to the heuristic of the golden rule, "Treat others how you would like to be treated." Parties mirror one another's attitudes, exchanging favors on the spot. Instant attitudinal reciprocity occurs among monkeys, and people often rely on it with strangers and acquaintances.

=== Calculated ===
Also known as, "what have you done for me lately?" Individuals keep track of the benefits they exchange with particular partners, which helps them decide to whom to return favors. This mechanism is typical of chimpanzees and very common among human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeWaal, F. B. M. 2005. "How animals do business." ??(?) ''Scientific American''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet some opposing experimental research suggests that calculated or contingent reciprocity does not spontaneously arise in laboratory experimental settings, despite patterns of behavior.

== Biological market theory ==
Biological market theory is an extension of the idea of reciprocal altruism, as a mechanism to explain altruistic acts between unrelated individuals in a more flexible system of exchanging commodities. The term 'biological market' was first used by Ronald Noe and Hammerstein in 1994 to refer to all the interactions between organisms in which different organisms function as 'traders' that exchange goods and services such as food and water, grooming, warning calls, shelter, etc. Biological market theory consists of five formal characteristics which present a basis for altruism.

# Commodities are exchanged between individuals that differ in the degree of control over those commodities.
# Trading partners are chosen from a number of potential partners.
# There is competition among the members of the chosen class to be the most attractive partner. This competition by 'outbidding' causes an increase in the value of the commodity offered.
# Supply and demand determine the bartering value of commodities exchanged.
# Commodities on offer can be advertised. As in commercial advertisements there is a potential for false information.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, R., &amp; Voelkl, B. (2013). "Cooperation and biological markets: The power of partner choice". In K. Sterelny, R. Joyce, B. Calcott, B. Fraser (Eds.), ''Cooperation and its evolution'' (pp. 131–151).

The applicability of biological market theory with its emphasis on partner choice is evident in the interactions between the [[cleaner wrasse]] and its "client" [[reef fish]]. [[Cleaner fish|Cleaners]] have small territories, which the majority of reef fish species actively visit to invite inspection of their surface, gills, and mouth. Clients benefit from the removal of [[Fish diseases and parasites|parasites]] while cleaners benefit from the access to a food source. Some particularly choosy client species have large home ranges that cover several [[cleaning station]]s, whereas other clients have small ranges and have access to one cleaning station only (resident clients). Field observations, field manipulations, and laboratory experiments revealed that whether or not a client has choice options influences several aspects of both cleaner and client behaviour. Cleaners give choosy clients priority of access. Choosy clients switch partners if cheated by a cleaner by taking a bite of out of the cleaner, whereas resident clients punish cheats. Cleaners and resident clients, but not choosy clients, build up relationships before normal cleaning interactions take place. Cleaners are particularly cooperative if choosy clients are bystanders of an interaction but less so when resident clients are bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;Bshary, R., &amp; Noë, R. (2003).

Hammerstein (Ed.), ''Genetic and cultural evolution of cooperation'' (pp. 167–184). Cambridge, MA US: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers tested whether wild white-handed [[gibbon]] males from [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand, increased their grooming activity when the female partner was fertile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barelii|first1=C|last2=Reichard|first2=U|last3=Mundry|first3=R|title=Is grooming used as a commodity in wild white-handed gibbons, Hylobates lar?|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2011|volume=82|issue=4|pages=801–809|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.012}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adult females and males of our study population are codominant (in terms of aggression), they live in pairs or small multi male groups and mate promiscuously. They found that males groomed females more than vice versa and more grooming was exchanged when females were cycling than during pregnancy or lactation. The number of copulations/day was elevated when females were cycling, and females copulated more frequently with males on days when they received more grooming. When males increased their grooming efforts, females also increased their grooming of males, perhaps to equalize give and take. Although grooming might be reciprocated because of intrinsic benefits of receiving grooming, males also interchange grooming as a commodity for sexual opportunities during a female's fertile period.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Fish===
* ''[[Harpagifer|Harpagifer bispinis]]'', a species of fish, live in social groups in the harsh environment of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. If the parent guarding the nest of eggs is removed, a usually male replacement unrelated to the parents guards the nest from predators and prevents fungal growth that would kill off the brood. There is no clear benefit to the male so the act may be considered altruistic.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, R.A.

[[File:Andon Otomasyon Panosu2.jpg|thumb|right|Signboard]]
'''Andon''' ({{lang-ja|アンドン or あんどん or 行灯}}) is a [[manufacturing]] [[Technical terminology|term]] referring to a system to notify management, maintenance, and other workers of a quality or process problem.  The centerpiece is a device incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem. The alert can be activated manually by a worker using a pullcord or button, or may be activated automatically by the production equipment itself.  The system may include a means to stop production so the issue can be corrected.  Some modern alert systems incorporate audio alarms, text, or other displays.

An Andon System is one of the principal elements of the [[Jidoka]] [[Quality control|quality-control]] method pioneered by Toyota as part of the [[Toyota Production System]] and therefore now part of the [[Lean production|Lean]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Liker, Jeffrey (2004) "The Toyota Way" New York:McGraw Hill {{ISBN|0-07-139231-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/EUM0000000001635 Robert J. Everett &amp; Amrik S. Sohal, (1991) "Individual Involvement and Intervention in Quality Improvement Programmes: Using the Andon System", International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 2]. Accessed 5 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the worker the ability, and moreover the empowerment, to stop production when a defect is found, and immediately call for assistance. Common reasons for manual activation of the Andon are part shortage, defect created or found, tool malfunction, or the existence of a safety problem. Work is stopped until a solution has been found. The alerts may be logged to a database so that they can be studied as part of a continuous-improvement program.

The system typically indicates where the alert was generated, and may also provide a description of the trouble. Modern Andon systems can include text, graphics, or audio elements. Audio alerts may be done with coded tones, music with different tunes corresponding to the various alerts, or pre-recorded verbal messages.

The concept/process of giving a non-management (production line) worker the authority to stop the production line because of a suspected quality issue is generally thought to have been pioneered by [[W. Edwards Deming]]. Many in Japan credit Deming as the inspiration for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war to start Japan on the road to becoming the second largest economy in the world through processes founded on the ideas Deming taught:

* Better design of products to improve service
* Higher level of uniform product quality
* Improvement of product testing in the workplace and in research centers
* Greater sales through side [global] markets

Usage of the word originated within [[Japan]]ese manufacturing companies, and in English is a [[loanword]] from a Japanese word for a [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan|paper lantern]].

The '''Apollonian and Dionysian''' is a [[philosophical]] and literary [[concept]], or also a [[dichotomy]], based on [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]] in [[Greek mythology]].  Some [[Western culture|Western]] philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and later followers.  

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both [[son of God|sons]] of [[Zeus]]. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.

==Nietzsche's version==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the terms were used before him in [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Del Caro, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709799 Dionysian Classicism, or Nietzsche's Appropriation of an Aesthetic Norm]", in ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1989), pp. 589–605 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them, while [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, [[Rudolf Steiner]] treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Satyrs and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men LACMA 50.9.43.jpg|thumb|230px|Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Sileni and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men]]

Nietzsche's [[aesthetic]] usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian "''Kunsttriebe''" ("artistic impulses") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. [[Nietzsche]] is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]] that tragedy begins its downfall ("''Untergang''"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the [[dialectic]]) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.

To further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the [[Socratic method|Socratic Dialectic]] as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for "higher" ideals. Nietzsche claims in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life.  Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. 
&lt;!-- As above, these two principles can only be described by provisional estimations and whatever Nietzsche states ought to mime that chord scrupulously, but these contrasts/notations might make it quite familiar to the reader wherewith their meaning can be adduced. Furthermore, something will have to be mentioned about the Greeks ''et cetera'' below in this section of the article; therefore, I have added a "section-stub" here. Consequently, other parts of this article will most likely require a slight alteration as well and additional evenhandedness, for this is a much debated topic. --&gt;

The interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in ''The Birth of Tragedy'', from their use in [[Greek tragedy]]: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the "Primordial Unity", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was "...burdened with all the errors of youth" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.

Different from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.

==Other viewpoints==
===Post-modern reading===
Nietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of ''fragmented consciousness'' or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeNOhsRjzrcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Michel+Foucault+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5jHLWLXKP&amp;sig=tBkq0FoIuszQzCyAvLlF0aJUNcc&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dEJ4ULm3N8jxsga8jYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Michel%20Foucault%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title=The Postmodernism Reader|first=Drolet |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the re-reading of modernity By Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Manchester University Press,1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3745-0}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Sloterdijk]], the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8166-1765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth being ''primordial pain'', our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.

Extending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Femininity and Masculinity in City-Form: Philosophical Urbanism as a History of Consciousness|journal=Human Studies|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–256|doi= 10.1007/s10746-006-9019-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9337128m117q48k2/|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruth Benedict===
Anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the [[Zuñi people]] as opposed to the Dionysian [[Kwakiutl|Kwakiutl people]].&lt;ref&gt;BENEDICT, R. (1932), CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE IN NORTH AMERICA. American Anthropologist, 34: 1–27. doi: 10.1525/aa.1932.34.1.02a00020&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work ''[[Patterns of Culture]]''.

===Albert Szent-Györgyi===
[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who wrote that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szent-Györgyi|first=Albert|date=1972-06-02|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/176/4038/966.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=176|issue=4038|pages=966–966|doi=10.1126/science.176.4038.966|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17778411}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge", Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Camille Paglia===
American humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller ''[[Sexual Personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1990). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]],'' New York: Vintage Books.{{isbn missing|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.

The Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and [[chthonic]] (she prefers ''Chthonic'' to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with [[hedonism]] and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that "the Dionysian is no picnic."). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: "Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: "The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and the older [[limbic]] and reptilian brains."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of &amp;ndash; or combat with &amp;ndash; Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: "The male orientation of [[classical Athens]] was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Āsava''' is a [[Pali]] term ([[Sanskrit]]: Āśrava) that is used in Buddhist scripture, philosophy, and psychology, meaning "influx, canker." It refers to the mental defilements of sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and ignorance, which perpetuate ''samsara'', the beginningless cycle of rebirth, ''dukkha'', and dying again.

''Asavas'' are also translated as "karmic predilections" and "karmic propensities" in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97342-3|pages=73–74 with notes 1 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also common in Jainism literature, and sometimes appears equivalently as ''Asrava'' or ''Anhaya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Govind Chandra Pande|title=Studies in the Origins of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__1kiAonBzIC|year=1995|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1016-7|pages=361–362 with note 253}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buddhism rejects the karma and asava theories of Jainism, and presents a different version instead.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;

==Etymology==
According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]],
{{quote|The commentaries derive the word from a root ''su'' meaning "to flow." Scholars differ as to whether the flow implied by the prefix ''ā'' is inward or outward; hence some have rendered it as "influxes" or "influences," others as "outflows" or "effluents."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}}}

==Meaning==

===Samsara===
{{main|Samsara (Buddhism)}}
The āsavas are mental defilements that perpetuate ''samsara'', the beginningless cycle of rebirth, ''dukkha'', and dying again. Carr and Mahalingam:
{{quote|inflow, influx, influence; mental bias or canker, cankers that keep one bound to the world of ''[[samsāra]]; used particularly in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Carr|Mahalingam|1997|p=948}}}}

Bikkhu Bodhi:
{{quote|A stock passage in the suttas indicates the term's real significance independently of etymology when it describes the ''āsavas'' as states "that defile, bring renewal of existence, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, aging and death" (MN 36.47; I 250). Thus other translators, bypassing the literal meaning, have rendered it "cankers," "corruptions," or "taints."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}}}

De Silva further explains:
The word canker suggests something that corrodes or corrupts slowly. These figurative meanings perhaps describe facets of the concept of ''āsava'': kept long in storage, oozing out, taint, corroding, etc.{{sfn|De Silva|2000|p=75}}

===Number of ''āsavas''===
Some Pali canons mention three ''āsava'' that sustain karmic flow. These three mentioned in the Nikāyas are "karmic propensities for sensual pleasures (''kāmāsava''), karmic propensities for existence (''bhavāsava''), and karmic propensities for ignorance (''avijjāsava'')".&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}

Other Pali texts mention four ''āsava'', adding ''diṭṭhāsava'' or "karmic propensities for a viewpoint or perspective".&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;{{sfn|De Silva|2000|p=75}}

In either case, these texts assert that the complete destruction of all these asavas is synonymous with complete Awakening.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p73"/&gt;

===Liberation===
According to Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), "Freedom from the 'Āsavas' constitutes [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arahantship]]."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921–25|p=115-16}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi,
{{quote|When the disciple's mind is liberated from the taints by the completion of the path of arhantship, he reviews his newly won freedom and roars his lion's roar: "Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming back to any state of being."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2005|p=229}}}}

==Textual appearance==
[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], in his [[Dhammapada (Radhakrishnan translation)|translation of the Dhammapada]], notes that the word "asava" appears in the ''[[Dhammapada]]'' in verses 93, 226, 253, 292, and 293.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1950|p=189}} Verse 226 (chapter 17, verse 6) has been translated by Acharya Buddharakkhita as follows:
{{quote|Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night,&lt;br&gt; 
and are ever intent upon Nibbana – their defilements fade away.{{sfn|Buddharakkhita|1985|p=39}}{{refn|group=note|Radhakrishnan: "6. sadā jāgaramānānam, ahorattānusikkhinam&lt;br&gt;nibbāṇam adhimuttānam, atthaṁ gacchanti āsavā 226."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1950|p=132}}}}}}

'''"Between the devil and the deep blue sea"''' is an [[idiom]] meaning a [[dilemma]]—i.e., to choose between two undesirable situations  (equivalent to "[[wiktionary:between a rock and a hard place|between a rock and a hard place]]").

The first recorded citation of "the Devil and the deep sea" in print is in [[Robert Monro]]'s ''His expedition with the worthy Scots regiment called Mac-keyes'', 1637: "I, with my partie, did lie on our poste, as betwixt the devill and the deep sea."

{{Violence against women}}
 
'''Bride burning''' or '''bride-burning''' is a form of [[domestic violence]] practiced in countries located on or around the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A category of [[dowry death]], bride-burning occurs when a young woman is [[murder]]ed by her husband or his family for her family's refusal to pay additional dowry. The wife is typically doused with [[kerosene]], [[gasoline]], or other flammable liquid, and set alight, leading to [[Death by burning|death by fire]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ash |first=Lucy |title=India's dowry deaths |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lakhani | first = Avnita | title = Bride-burning: the "elephant in the room" is out of control | journal = [[Pepperdine Dispute Resolution Law Journal]] | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–298 | publisher = [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] | date = 2005 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/pepds5&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&amp;context=drlj pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerosene is most often used as the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aishaiqbal.blogspot.com/2007/02/bride-burning.html |title=Aisha Iqbal: Bride Burning- in the name of dowry |publisher=Aishaiqbal.blogspot.com |date=8 February 2007 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most common in India and has been a major problem there since at least 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1996-08-18/world/9608_18_bride.burn_1_dowry-hindu-attitudes?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Brideburning claims hundreds in India – CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=18 August 1996 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Dowry deaths===
A [[dowry death]] is the death of a young woman in South Asian countries, primarily [[India]], who is murdered or driven to [[suicide]] by her husband. This results from the husband continually attempting to extract more dowry from the bride or her family. Bride burning is just one form of dowry death. Others include [[acid throwing]] and [[Eve teasing]]. Because dowry typically depends on class or socioeconomic status, women are often subjected to the dowry pressures of their future husband or his relatives.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

===Origins of bride burning===
There are at least four perspectives on why bride burning came to be and how its existence has prevailed in South Asian nations, as detailed by Avnita Lakhani in her report on bride burning titled “The Elephant in the Room Is Out of Control". These theories describe practices that contributed to the rise of dowry as a whole, thus ultimately contributing to bride burning.

One of the more culturally-founded theories suggests that in a highly patriarchal society such as India, a woman’s role is defined from before she is born, which ultimately places her as lesser than men.&lt;ref name="Nangia"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nangia | first = Anshu | title = Note: the tragedy of bride burning in India: how should the law address it? | journal = [[Brooklyn Journal of International Law]] | volume = 22 | pages = 637–694 | publisher = [[Brooklyn Law School]] | date = 1996–1997 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bjil22&amp;div=31&amp;id=&amp;page | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=22+Brooklyn+J.+Int%27l+L.+637&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=6a3e2417a95ef12fac702ce6549e7ea1 Lexis Nexis.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because she is seen as a burden and an "extra mouth to feed",&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; her status as an economic liability promotes the idea that men, who are considered physical assets, can treat women as subservient.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Once a woman marries, she is bound to her husband and his will because “society mandates obedience to her husband".&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt;

Another theory claims that consumerism, a primarily Western ideal that is newly founded in developing nations, has caused countries like India to become greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pardee | first = Laurel Remers | title = The dilemma of dowry deaths: domestic disgrace or international human rights catastrophe | journal = [[James E. Rogers College of Law|Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law]] | volume = 13 | pages = 491–522 | publisher = [[James E.

Lakhani also suggests that, historically speaking, it has been noted that the dowry system may have been conceived as a way to distinguish Muslim from Hindu culture,&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt; creating a further divide within [[castes]]. A higher dowry would indicate a higher status and distinction from Islam, thus providing an incentive to demand a larger dowry.&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt;

Finally, some scholars argue that the dowry practice came out of British rule and influence in India in order to distinguish "different forms of marriage" between castes.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; When the dowry system was established within the higher castes, the British government sought to reinforce it in the lower castes as a means to eradicate their more ritualised marriages.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Such forms of union were discredited until only upper caste marriage systems were recognised.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

===In India===
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|A Muslim organization -[[Karnataka Forum for Dignity]]'s  poster against Dowry system in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
{{see also|Dowry system in India|Dowry law in India}}

Dr. Ashley K. Jutla, MD and [[David Heimbach]] describe bride burning by saying that "the husband and/or in-laws have determined that the dowry, a gift given from the daughter's parents to the husband, was inadequate and therefore attempt to murder the new bride to make the husband available to remarry or to punish the bride and her family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jutla | first1 = Rajni K. | last2 = Heimbach | first2 = David | title = Love burns: an essay about bride burning in India | journal = Journal of Burn Care &amp; Rehabilitation | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–170 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 15091143 | date = March–April 2004 | url = http://journals.lww.com/burncareresearch/Abstract/2004/03000/Love_Burns__An_Essay_about_Bride_Burning_in_India.5.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1097/01.bcr.0000111929.70876.1f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, dowry size is a reflection of wealth. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar has written a play on dowry deaths titled 'The Bride Who Would Not Burn.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rajesh Talwar | url = https://www.amazon.com/author/rajeshtalwar | website = amazon.com | publisher = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the Government of India passed the Dowry Prohibition Act, making the dowry demands in wedding arrangements illegal.&lt;ref name="Act"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 | url = http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionact.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150909082421/http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionact.htm | website = wcd.nic.in | publisher = [[Ministry of Women and Child Development (India)]]  | date = 20 May 1961 | archive-date = 9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Indian Parliament added dowry deaths as a new [[domestic violence]] crime. According to the new section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, where a bride "within 7 years of her marriage is killed and it is shown that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband, or any relative of her husband, or in connection with any demand for dowry, such death shall be called 'dowry death' and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death."&lt;ref name="Act" /&gt;

The offenders can be sentenced for any period, from a minimum of seven years in prison to a maximum of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Annex C: Legal framework surrounding domestic violence in India | editor-last1 = Johnson | editor-first1 = Cate | title = Domestic violence in India: recommendations of the women's rights team: report to USAID/India PROWID | date = October 1996 | pages = 28–42 |display-editors=etal}} (Explaining section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides, and murders have been reported. A 1997 report claimed that at least 5000 women die each year because of dowry deaths and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Kitchen fires kill Indian brides with inadequate dowry | publisher = [[United Press International|UPI]] | location = New Delhi, India | date = 23 July 1997 }} [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/52a/033.html Extract.]&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 percent of reported dowry deaths result in convictions in courts.&lt;ref name=ncrb/&gt;

===In Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the Progressive Women's Association says that 300 women are burned to death each year by their husband's families and that bride burning incidents are sometimes disguised as accidents, such as an 'exploding stove'.&lt;ref name="BBC_1999"/&gt;  According to the Association, doctors say that victims presenting from these accidents have injuries inconsistent with stove burns.&lt;ref name="BBC_1999"&gt;{{cite news

==In other nations==
Occasionally, bride burning happens among resettled Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in other parts of the world, including the United States.

===In the United States===
Aleyamma  Mathew was a registered nurse at a hospital in [[Carrollton, Texas]], who died of burn wounds on 5 April 1992.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parameswaran | first = Radhika | title = Coverage of "Bride Burning" in the "Dallas Observer": a cultural analysis of the "Other" | journal = [[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 69–100 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.2307/3346804 | jstor = 3346804 | date = 1996 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3346804 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://jthomasniu.org/class/781/Assigs/otheriing111.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband, Mathew Varughese, had immigrated from India two decades before and had three daughters in the United States.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;  The couple had been having marital problems since the late 1980s, which culminated in a fight that led to Aleyamma’s death.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;  She was found by her children, doused in gasoline and covered in flames, dying soon after.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;

Brief articles were run in the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' and ''[[The Atlanta-Journal Constitution]]'' after the incident, while the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' ran a detailed, nine page article covering Aleyamma’s death.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt; The article faced some criticism for its portrayal of non-Western countries as backward or inappropriate: “Battered by her husband, Aleyamma Mathew remained true to her culture. In the end she became its victim.”&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;

==Controlling bride burning==
There are current governmental initiatives to criminalize bride burning and grassroots organizations working to combat the practice, as well as international laws working against human rights violations.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Finally, there are many proposed initiatives in place to end bride burning globally.

===Governmental efforts===
In 1961, India enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Greenberg | first = Judith G. | title = Criminalizing dowry deaths: the Indian experience | journal = Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 801–846 | publisher = [[American University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geoimlj7&amp;div=40&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1410&amp;context=jgspl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; to halt dowry murders. It was amended in the early 1980s to “rectify several inherent weaknesses and loopholes”&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt; in order to make it a criminal offense if the husband or his relatives causes a woman to “die of burns or bodily injury or unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage and where there is evidence that she suffered cruelty and harassment in connection with the dowry.”&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Unfortunately, this particular law does not provide a comprehensive definition of dowry, which can change the way it is demanded and delivered. Ultimately, this allowed perpetrators more flexibility in the court of dowry death.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; The seven-year clause is equally problematic, as it simply allowed husbands to wait until that period ended to burn or otherwise cause the death of their bride.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

Another major Indian law, the 1983 “Anti-Cruelty Statute", prohibits cruelty towards a wife and subjects the husband and/or in-laws to fines or imprisonment if they inflict cruelty upon the wife.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; However, the law is equally ambiguous, which results in inadequate enforcement of bride burning and dowry murders.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] declares the following: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights | url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml | website = un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] }} [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 5 proclaims: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

===Non-governmental efforts===
In India, where most cases of bride burning are seen, domestic legislation is typically inadequately enforced. Because of this, grassroots organizations “have taken up the cause to halt bride burning". One example of this is government-funded family counseling center cells, in which the intended goal is to strengthen family ties and reduce legal intervention. However, often such cells only reinforce the stereotype of “women’s sharp tongues” and men’s power to “hit and beat.”&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Other similar counseling-style [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s have been developed in order to resolve such issues with similar consequences.&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt;

===Potential efforts===
Primarily, alternative initiatives resolve around reform of current flawed, failing laws. One proposal calls for the expansion of the protection for women under the international refugee law  in order to provide asylum to victims of gender discrimination or gendercide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cipriani | first = Linda | title = Gender and persecution: protecting women under international refugee law | journal = Georgetown Immigration Law Journal | volume = 7 | pages = 511–548 | publisher = [[Georgetown University Law Center]] | date = 1993 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geoimlj7&amp;div=39&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this could be achieved would be by including women in the definition of a “persecuted social group”,&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; which would allow their gender to seek international asylum under fear of dowry-related persecution globally.

In April 1984, European Parliament introduced a proposal that would “protect women from persecution on the basis of gender”&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; by reforming international refugee laws.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; However, the proposal was rejected.

Another solution is to increase economic interest for women by establishing their [[Women's property rights|property rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gopal | first = Gita | title = Gender and economic inequality in India: the legal connection | journal = Boston College Third World Law Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–86 | publisher = [[Boston College]] | date = 1993 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bctw13&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1280&amp;context=twlj Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even when married, the bride has no rights over the property belonging to the husband while he is living.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; In giving women the right to own property, women would not need to marry for economic or legal purposes, thus disregarding the dowry practice.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11634">In contemporary philosophy, a '''brute fact''' is a fact that has no explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Fahrbach. "Understanding brute facts," ''Synthese'' 145 (3):449 - 466 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  More narrowly, brute facts may instead be defined as those facts which cannot be explained (as opposed to simply having no explanation).&lt;ref&gt;John Hospers, ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis'' (1997) p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; To reject the existence of brute facts is to think that everything can be explained. ("Everything can be explained" is sometimes called [[the principle of sufficient reason]]). There are two ways to explain something: say what "brought it about", or describe it at a more "fundamental" level.{{cn|date=March 2016}} For example, a cat displayed on a computer screen can be explained, more "fundamentally", as there being certain voltages in bits of metal in the screen, which in turn can be explained, more "fundamentally", as certain subatomic particles moving in a certain manner. If we keep explaining the world in this way and reach a point at which no more "deeper" explanations can be given, then we would have found some facts which are brute or inexplicable, in the sense that we {{cns|text=cannot give them an ''[[Ontology|ontological]] explanation''|date=March 2016}}. As it might be put, there may exist some things that just ''are''. The same thing can be done with ''[[causal explanation]]s''. If nothing made the [[Big Bang]] expand at the velocity it did, then this is a brute fact in the sense that it lacks a causal explanation.

==Brute/scientific fact==

[[Henri Poincaré]] distinguished between brute facts and their scientific descriptions, pointing to how the conventional nature of the latter always remained constrained by the brute fact in question.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gutting, ''French Philosophy in the Twentieth Century'' (2001) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Duhem]] argued that just as there may be several scientific descriptions of the same brute fact, so too there may be many brute facts with the same scientific description.&lt;ref&gt;Gutting, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anscombe==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{unclear|section|reason (editor version)=need a good rewrite; and stop "heavy-lifting" Anscombe's words without adding furthur elaboration/explanation; Anscombe's explanations has a tendency to be digressing and "naggy" (as contrasted with razor-sharp reductionism) in a confusing way|date=March 2016}}{{refimprove |section|date=March 2016}}}}
[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] wrote about how facts can be brute relative to other facts. Simply put, some facts cannot be reducible to other facts, such that if some set of facts holds true, it does not entail the fact brute relative to it.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

The example she uses is that of someone owing a grocer money for supplying them with potatoes. In such a case, the set of facts, e.g. that the customer asked for the potatoes, that the grocer supplied them with the potatoes, etc., does not necessarily entail that the customer owes the grocer money. After all, this could all have transpired on the set of a film as a bit of acting, in which case the customer would not ''actually'' owe anything.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

One might argue that if the institutional context is taken into account, putatively brute facts ''can'' be reduced to constituent facts. That is, in the context of something like the institution of a market, a customer ordering potatoes, etc. would entail that they owe the grocer compensation equal to the service that was provided. While Anscombe does acknowledge that an institutional context is necessary for a particular description to make sense, it does not necessarily follow that a particular set of facts holding true in an institutional context entails the fact brute relative to it. To wit, if the example is indeed considered in the institutional context necessary for descriptions of 'owing', it could still be the case that the customer does not owe the grocer, per the counterexample of a film production. This fundamental ambiguity is essentially what makes a fact brute relative to other facts.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

That being said, Anscombe does argue that under normal circumstance, such a fact ''is'' actually entailed. That is, if it is true that a customer requested potatoes, etc., then ''under normal circumstances'' the customer would indeed owe the grocer money. However, because such entailment is conditional on such a set of facts holding true under a particular set of circumstances, the fact entailed is still fundamentally brute relative to such facts, just that in such a case the leap in inference occurs at the level of the circumstances, not that of the facts themselves.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Finally, if a fact brute relative to other facts holds true, it follows that some set of facts it is brute relative to is also true, e.g. if the customer owes the grocer money, then it follows that the grocer supplied them with potatoes. After all, had they not done so, then the customer would not owe them money. As such, given some fact brute relative to other facts, there is a range of facts, such that a set of them will hold if the fact brute relative to them also holds. That being said, Anscombe argues that the full range of facts that some fact can be brute relative to cannot be known exhaustively. The rough range can be sketched out with relevant, paradigmatic examples, but the full range of such facts cannot be known, as one can theoretically always suppose a new special context that changes the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anscombe|first1=G.E.M.|authorlink1=On Brute Facts|title=The Collected Philosophical Papers of G. E. M. Anscombe|volume=Volume III: Ethics, Religion and Politics|date=1981|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-12942-1|pages=22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searle==

[[John Searle]] developed Anscombe's concept of brute facts into what he called brute physical facts—such as that snow is on Mt. Everest—as opposed to social or institutional facts, dependent for their existence on human agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 121 and p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he considered money to be an institutional fact, which nevertheless rested ultimately on a brute physical fact, whether a piece of paper or only an electronic record.

Searle thought that the pervasiveness of social facts could disguise their [[Social constructivism|social construction]] and ultimate reliance upon the brute fact: thus, we are for example trained from infancy (in his words) to see "cellulose fibres with green and gray stains, or enamel-covered iron concavities containing water...[as] dollar bills, and full bathtubs".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 56 and p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
The [[principle of sufficient reason]] is sometimes understood to entail that there are no brute facts.

According to the Principle of Sufficient Reason all facts must have an explanation and this seems to exclude brute facts. But the truth of this principle is not accepted by all. After all, if no brute facts exist, how are fundamental laws possible? One could argue that the principle of sufficient reason is true a priori but that is something that has famously been disputed by David Hume.

==Vintiadis==
In 2018 Elly Vintiadis edited a collection of papers on brute facts that is the first systematic exploration of bruteness and which includes original papers by a number of philosophers and scientists. The collection focuses on physical, emergent and modal brute facts rather than social facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1034594829|title=Brute facts|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Vintiadis|first=Elly|last2=Mekios|first2=Constantinos|isbn=9780191818523|edition=1st|location=New York, NY|oclc=1034594829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vintiadis argues that a properly understood naturalistic attitude requires that we accept the existence of ontological brute facts and also, possibly, emergent brute facts.

Beyond the initial definition given above of brute facts as facts that that do not have explanations, there is a distinction drawn by Eric Barnes (1994) between epistemically brute facts and ontologically brute facts. The former are for which we do not have an explanation, they are brute for us (e.g., Vintiadis cites the fact that gases behave in a manner described by the Boyle-Charles law was an epistemologically brute fact until its explanation in terms of the kinetic theory of gases). The latter, ontologically brute facts are facts for which there is no explanation in virtue of the way the world is (e.g., the fundamental laws of physics). Which facts we accept as ontologically brute though depends on what kind of theory of explanation we accept (e.g. the properties of fundamental particles will be brute facts under a mereological view of explanation, but a fundamental law will be brute under a covering law model of explanation).

==Brute Necessities==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
John Heil has argued that brute facts can only be contingent facts, since otherwise asking for an explanation for something that couldn’t be otherwise doesn’t make sense. Joseph Levine agrees with this since for him explanation means removing different possibilities. But not all agree, because some philosophers argue that it is a natural question to ask why some things are necessary.{{who|date=October 2018}} For instance philosopher James Van Cleve believes that brute necessities cannot be excluded.

==Infinitism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
According to explanatory infinitism, the chain of explanations goes on infinitely and there is no fundamental explanation. This, then, is another way of objecting to the existence of explanatory brute facts, but also metaphysical brute facts, if bruteness is understood in terms of ontological independence.

The '''chicken''' (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') is a type of [[domestication|domesticated]] [[fowl]], a subspecies of the [[red junglefowl]]. It is one of the most common and widespread [[domestic animals]], with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011.

[[File:Chicken anatomy.jpg|thumb|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a chicken.]]
In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as ''[[cock (bird)|cock]]s'', whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called ''[[rooster]]s''. Males less than a year old are ''[[cockerels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cockerel |title=Cockerel – definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[castration|Castrated]] roosters are called ''[[capon]]s'' (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as ''hens'', and younger females as ''[[pullet]]s'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pullet |title=Pullet – definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age.  In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term ''[[chook]]'' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʊ|k}} to describe all ages and both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Definition of "chook" in ''Encarta''.  The vernacular use is said to be offensive in this dictionary but it may also be used as a term of jocular familiarity |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQrJia9?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young are often called ''chicks''.

"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJCTL_mC5w4C |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2001-01-01 |isbn=978-0300138139 |first=Janet Vorwald |last=Dohner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species as a whole was then called ''domestic fowl'', or just ''[[fowl]]''.  This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British [[public house]] or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example [[Hen and Chicken Islands]]). The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used.

In the [[Deep South]] of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term ''[[yardbird]]''.&lt;ref name=berhardt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berhardt |first1=Clyde E.

The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the [[breed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruleworks.co.uk/cgi-bin/TUfaq.exe?Guide=Poultry&amp;Category=Poultry%20-%20General#q9 |title=The Poultry Guide – A to Z and FAQs |publisher=Ruleworks.co.uk |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jamon. [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060806/NEWS/608060400/1007/NEWS02 Tuscaloosanews.com "World’s oldest chicken starred in magic shows, was on 'Tonight Show’"], ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' (Alabama, USA).

Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (''hackles'') and backs (''saddle''), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
A ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].
Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

=== Behavior ===
==== Social behaviour ====
[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]
[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]
Chickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "[[pecking order]]", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock " Musings from a Stonehead |publisher=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.

A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |title=Top cock: Roosters crow in pecking order |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1993-07-01 |title=On the meaning of alarm calls: functional reference in an avian vocal system |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347283711589 |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1158 |issn=0003-3472 |last1=Evans |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Evans |first2=Linda |last3=Marler |first3=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Courtship ====
To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.&lt;ref name="grandin69"&gt;{{cite book |title=Animals in Translation |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |author2=Johnson, Catherine |year=2005 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7432-4769-6 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance triggers a response in the hen&lt;ref name="grandin69" /&gt; and when she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.

More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:  1. Male approaching the hen.  2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing.  3. Male waltzing.  4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet  on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cheng |first=Kimberly M.  and Burns, Jeffrey T. |date=1988 |title=Dominance relationship and mating behavior of domestic cocks--a model to study mate-guarding and sperm competition in birds |url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v090n03/p0697-p0704.pdf |journal=The Condor |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=697–704 |via= |doi=10.2307/1368360 |jstor=1368360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nesting and laying behaviour ====
[[File:Chicken eggs.jpg|thumb|200px|Chicken [[egg (biology)|eggs]] vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) ([[Araucana]] varieties).]]
[[File:Küken vor dem ersten Ausflug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chicks before their first outing]]

Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own.  The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2–3 |pages=211–222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Broodiness ====
Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go [[Broodiness|broody]]".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe.  While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation.  To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest.  To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.

[[Breed]]s artificially developed for [[egg as food|egg production]] rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] or [[Goose|geese]].

==== Hatching and early life ====
Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.&lt;ref name="grandin69" /&gt;  Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by "pipping"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.

Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]].  Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://ps.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/5/789.short | doi=10.3382/ps.0640789| pmid=4001066| title=Early Egg Production in Genetically Blind (rc/rc) Chickens in Comparison with Sighted (Rc+/rc) Controls| journal=Poultry Science| volume=64| issue=5| pages=789–794| year=1985| last1=Ali| first1=A.| last2=Cheng| first2=K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.

=== Embryology ===
[[File:Embryo.ogv|thumb|Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo]]
In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds "turned on" a chicken [[recessive gene]], ''talpid2'', and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have "...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1666805 Scientists Find Chickens Retain Ancient Ability to Grow Teeth] Ammu Kannampilly, [[ABC News]], February 27, 2006.

== Breeding ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Gallus gallus male Kaziranga 0.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Male red junglefowl.]]

The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the [[red junglefowl]] (''Gallus gallus'') and is scientifically classified as the same species.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong |first1=GK |display-authors=etal |title=A genetic variation map for chicken with 2.8 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7018 |pages=717–722 |doi=10.1038/nature03156 |pmid=15592405 |pmc=2263125 |date=December 2004 |bibcode=2004Natur.432..717B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the [[grey junglefowl]] (''G. sonneratii'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eriksson |first1=J |last2=Larson |first2=G |last3=Gunnarsson |first3=U |last4=Bed'hom |first4=B |last5=Tixier-Boichard |first5=M |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Identification of the Yellow Skin Gene Reveals a Hybrid Origin of the Domestic Chicken |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000010 |journal=PLoS Genet |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e1000010 |pmid=18454198 |pmc=2265484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that chickens [[domestication|were first domesticated]] for [[cockfighting]] in Asia, Africa, and Europe.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of [[Thailand]] gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.&lt;ref name="oneMatriarch"&gt;{{citation |title=One subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus gallus) suffices as the matriarchic ancestor of all domestic breeds |first=A |last=Fumihito |first2=T |last2=Miyake |first3=S |last3=Sumi |first4=M |last4=Takada |first5=S |last5=Ohno |first6=N |last6=Kondo |journal=PNAS |date=December 20, 1994 |volume=91 |number=26 |pages=12505–12509 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.26.12505 |pmid=7809067 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9112505F |pmc=45467}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the [[clade]] found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], where a large number of unique [[haplotype]]s occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Yi-Ping |last=Liu |first2=Gui-Sheng |last2=Wu |first3=Yong-Gang |last3=Yao |first4=Yong-Wang |last4=Miao |first5=Gordon |last5=Luikart |first6=Mumtaz |last6=Baig |first7=Albano |last7=Beja-Pereira |first8=Zhao-Li |last8=Ding |first9=Malliya Gounder |last9=Palanichamy |first10=Ya-Ping |last10=Zhang |title=Multiple maternal origins of chickens: Out of the Asian jungles |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |number=1 |year=2006 |pages=12–19 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.09.014 |pmid=16275023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zeder |year=2006 |title=Documenting domestication: the intersection of genetics and archaeology |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.01.007 |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=139–155 |pmid=16458995 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is postulated that the red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year [[bamboo]] seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Rick |last=King |title=Rat Attack |date=February 24, 2009 |journal=NOVA and National Geographic Television |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/rat-attack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Rick |last=King |title=Plant vs. Predator |date=February 1, 2009 |journal=NOVA |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/plant-vs-predator.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1=B. |last2=Zhou |first2=B.X. |year=1988 |title=Did chickens go north?

Instead, the origin could be the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan culture]] of the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]]. Eventually, the chicken moved to the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim basin]] of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="CHOF"&gt;CHOF : The Cambridge History of Food, 2000, [[Cambridge University Press]], vol.1,  pp496-499&lt;/ref&gt;
Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the [[Roman Empire]], and was reduced in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;  [[DNA sequencing|Genetic sequencing]] of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the [[High Middle Ages]] chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Marley |title=Fast Food |journal=Archaeology |date=Sep–Oct 2017 |volume=70 |issue=5 |page=18 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=38&amp;sid=d022d3dd-d76c-4a0c-8bda-3d22c2e5033b%40sessionmgr103 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |format=PDF |issn=0003-8113 |postscript={{subscription needed |via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in [[Syria]]; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached [[Egypt]] for purposes of [[cockfighting]] about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] Egypt (about 300 BC).&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt; Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa. It was during the [[Hellenistic period]] (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"/&gt; This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe.

Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian [[Nile River|Nile]] Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]]. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by [[extinction]] may also help with research into this area.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

==== South America ====
An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the [[araucana]], bred in southern [[Chile]] by the [[Mapuche]] people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and are evidence of [[pre-Columbian]] trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the [[Arauco Peninsula]] in [[Zona Sur|south-central Chile]]. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070604/full/447620b.html DNA reveals how the chicken crossed the sea] Brendan Borrell, ''Nature'', June 5, 2007. Retrieved October 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Storey et al., "Radiocarbon and DNA evidence for a pre-Columbian introduction of Polynesian chickens to Chile", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0703993104; John Noble Wilford, "First Chickens in Americas were Brought from Polynesia, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gongora |first1=Jaime |last2=Rawlence |first2=Nicolas J. |last3=Mobegi |first3=Victor A. |last4=Jianlin |first4=Han |last5=Alcalde |first5=Jose A. |last6=Matus |first6=Jose T. |last7=Hanotte |first7=Olivier |last8=Moran |first8=Chris |last9=Austin |first9=J. | last10 = Ulm | first10 = Sean |last11=Anderson |first11=Atholl J. |last12=Larson |first12=Greger |last13=Cooper |first13=Alan |year=2008 |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA |url= |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=30 |pages=10308–10313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105 |pmid=18663216 |pmc=2492461 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10510308G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of poultry are raised in [[Intensive animal farming|factory farms]]. According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], 74 percent of the world's poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Towards Happier Meals In A Globalized World |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/towards-happier-meals-globalized-world |publisher=World Watch Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to intensive poultry farming is [[free-range]] farming.

Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of [[ethical consumerism]]. Opponents of [[intensive farming]] argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ilea |first=Ramona Cristina |date=2009-04-01 |title=Intensive Livestock Farming: Global Trends, Increased Environmental Concerns, and Ethical Solutions |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=153–167 |doi=10.1007/s10806-008-9136-3 |issn=1187-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tilman |first=David |last2=Cassman |first2=Kenneth G. |last3=Matson |first3=Pamela A. |last4=Naylor |first4=Rosamond |last5=Polasky |first5=Stephen |date=2002-08-08 |title=Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/nature01014.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6898 |pages=671–677 |doi=10.1038/nature01014 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=12167873 |bibcode=2002Natur.418..671T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reared for meat ====
{{Main|Broiler}}
[[File:Florida chicken house.jpg|thumb|right|A commercial chicken house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat]]
Chickens farmed for meat are called [[broiler]]s. Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalsaustralia.org/factsheets/broiler_chickens.php |title=Broiler Chickens Fact Sheet // Animals Australia |publisher=Animalsaustralia.org |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[free range]] or [[Organic (food)|organic]] broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age.

==== Reared for eggs ====
{{Main|Egg as food}}
Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.egginfo.co.uk/egg-facts-and-figures/industry-information/data |title=UK Egg Industry Data {{!}} Official Egg Info |website=www.egginfo.co.uk |access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hen [[List of chicken breeds|breeds]] can produce over 300 eggs per year, with "the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0440423104/ ''Guinness World Records 2011''] ed. by Craig Glenday – page 286&lt;/ref&gt;  After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable.  Hens, particularly from [[battery cage]] systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,,662799,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Ten weeks to live |first=Anthony |last=Browne |date=March 10, 2002 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as "soup hens".&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;  In some other countries, flocks are sometimes [[Forced molting|force moulted]], rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying.

=== As pets ===
{{Main|Chickens as pets}}
Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upc-online.org/home.html |title=Providing a Good Home for Chickens |author=United Poultry Concerns |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain breeds, such as [[Silkie]]s and many [[Bantam (poultry)|bantam]] varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henkeeping.co.uk/which.html |title=Clucks and Chooks: A guide to keeping chickens |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730222405/http://www.henkeeping.co.uk/which.html |archivedate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial incubation ===
[[File:Egg incubator.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An egg incubator]]
Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2104/ANSI-8100web.pdf |author=Joe G.

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8&amp;nbsp;°F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|°C|°F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.

Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.

== Diseases and ailments ==
Chickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worms]], as well as other diseases.  Despite the name, they are not affected by [[chickenpox]], which is generally restricted to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2001.tb00416.x |last1=White |first1=T.

[[File:Persian Cock.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vatican Persian Cock — A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican ([[Holy See]]) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] denoting the status of being [[holy]] in that religious schema.]]
Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Adler |first1=Jerry |last2=Lawler |first2=Andrew |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Chicken-Conquered-the-World.html |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deeply embedded within belief systems and [[religious worship]]. The term "Persian bird" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact "because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peters |first=John P. |date=1913 |title=The Cock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGUPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=33 |pages=363–396 |jstor=592841 |doi=10.2307/592841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]] the chicken has great significance during the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[cremation]] ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.

In [[ancient Greece]], the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were "[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.

The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.

In the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: "Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34&lt;/ref&gt; It happened,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.

Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34. For a recent study of chickens in the New Testament, see Joshua N. Tilton "[http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ Chickens and the Cultural Context of the Gospels]" [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ www.jerusalemperspective.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century, [[Pope Gregory I]] declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by [[Edward Walford]], [[John Charles Cox]], George Latimer Apperson – page 202&lt;/ref&gt; and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by [[Pope Nicholas I]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com" /&gt; ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philadelphia Museum bulletin'', Volumes 1-5, Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, p 14, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Central European [[Folklore|folk tales]], the [[devil]] is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.

In traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called [[kapparos]]; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.

The [[Talmud]] speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's mate" from the rooster.&lt;ref&gt;Eruvin 100b.&lt;/ref&gt; This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks",&lt;ref&gt;A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L.

[[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b&lt;/ref&gt; which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of "A cock girded about the loins" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay–Rheims Bible]]) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",&lt;ref&gt;PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages&lt;/ref&gt; identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.

The chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with "serious" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today.

A [[cockatrice]] was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's call.

[[File:Red junglefowl hm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[red junglefowl]]]]
An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (''*manuk'') is part of the reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language]] {{crossref|(see [[Austronesian languages]])}}. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the [[Lapita]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ9ULYwX3zgC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Chickens,+together+with+dogs+and+pigs,+were+the+domestic+animals+of+the+Lapita+culture,+the+first+Neolithic+culture+of+Oceania.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3e3mOr4AZE&amp;sig=MJjoAwUowJLntgnWNZpz2CQxpOc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmVLUPPYD8KO2AWrt4GYAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chickens%2C%20together%20with%20dogs%20and%20pigs%2C%20were%20the%20domestic%20animals%20of%20the%20Lapita%20culture%2C%20the%20first%20Neolithic%20culture%20of%20Oceania.&amp;f=false] The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders By Donald Denoon, Malama Meleisea – Cambridge University Press, March 25, 2004 – page 56&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Neolithic]] culture of Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlSspaBLkhoC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;lpg=PA411&amp;dq=lapita+the+first+Neolithic+culture+of+Oceania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WIEGSQMt8O&amp;sig=vH8TP9pGgf2FwZ4upxIjoxfCXbs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1GVLUIqrIMaI2gW_uYCIBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lapita%20the%20first%20Neolithic%20culture%20of%20Oceania&amp;f=false] Anthropological Genetics: Theory, Methods and Applications edited by Michael H.

In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for [[Symposium|symposia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onagriculturewit02coluuoft |title=On agriculture, with a recension of the text and an English translation by Harrison Boyd Ash |last=Columella |first=Lucius Junius Moderatus |date=1941 |publisher=Cambridge Harvard University Press |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delos]] seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, ''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). "About 3200 BC chickens were common in [[Sindh]]. After the attacks of [[Aria]] people these fowls spred from Sindh to Balakh and Iran.

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] used chickens for oracles, both when flying ("ex avibus", [[Augury]]) and when feeding ("auspicium ex tripudiis", [[Alectryomancy]]). The hen ("gallina") gave a favourable omen ("auspicium ratum"), when appearing from the left (Cic., de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl.

For the oracle "ex tripudiis" according to [[Cicero]] (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used in [[auspice]], and shows at one point that any bird could perform the ''tripudium''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RYhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA601&amp;lpg=PA601&amp;dq=The+Romans+used+chickens+for+oracles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OpWs3qaTCq&amp;sig=JQkBl7qznVphAkr5c_EsrNfQP6c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cpxLUNv2CIjq2QX0yYHwBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sacred%20chickens&amp;f=false] A classical and archaeological dictionary of the manners, customs, laws, institutions, arts, etc. of the celebrated nations of antiquity, and of the middle ages: To which is prefixed A synoptical and chronological view of ancient history – P.

The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed.

In 162 BC, the ''Lex Faunia'' forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QmevzbQ0AsIC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=Rome+forbade+the+consumption+of+fattened+chickens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oNJ71NY_rm&amp;sig=KgEDxCUwRHAtFHMDRS8t4Uw5jlk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nndLUJaJHc6ByAHYtoC4DQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rome%20forbade%20the%20consumption%20of%20fattened%20chickens&amp;f=false] A History of Food By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat – John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 25, 2009 – page 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[A History of Food By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat – John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 25, 2009 – page 305]&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters ([[capon]]), which resulted in a doubling of size&lt;ref&gt;Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, (Anthea Bell, translator) ''The History of Food'', Ch. 11 "The History of Poultry", revised ed. 2009, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty "tail" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).

The Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.

According to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).

Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and "poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=surOAlOzK9&amp;sig=M7g4WsSKZE0xt-tSoYD8dmPyi8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MqJLULLIMarg2wWtpoHYDQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Per%20Columella%2C%20chicken%20coops&amp;f=false] The New England farmer, Volume 6 By Thomas Greene Fessenden – Thomas W. Shepard, 1828 – page 69&lt;/ref&gt; Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.

According to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.

Chickens were spread by [[Polynesia]]n seafarers and reached [[Easter Island]] in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the [[Polynesian rat]] (''Rattus exulans'').

'''Chữ Nôm''' ({{Vi-nom|𡨸喃}}, {{IPA-vi|cɨ̌ˀ nom|IPA}}, literally "Southern characters"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Khuê |date=2009 |title=Chữ Nôm: cơ sở và nâng cao |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in earlier times also called ''quốc âm'' or ''chữ nam'', is a [[logographic]] writing system formerly used to write the [[Vietnamese language]]. It used the standard set of classical [[Chinese characters]] to represent [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] and some native Vietnamese words, while new characters were created on the Chinese model to represent other words. &lt;ref name="Chữ-nôm script"&gt;{{cite web

Although formal writing in Vietnam was done in [[classical Chinese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tri Tài |date=2002 |title=Giáo trình tiếng Hán. Tập I: Cơ sở |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the early 20th century (except for two brief interludes), chữ Nôm was widely used between the 15th and 19th centuries by Vietnam's cultured elite, including women, for popular works, many in verse. One of the best-known pieces of Vietnamese literature, ''[[The Tale of Kiều]]'', was composed in chữ Nôm.

In the 1920s, the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]] displaced chữ Nôm as the preferred way to record Vietnamese. The characters are still used for decorative, historic and ceremonial value and symbols of good luck. The task of preservation and study of Vietnamese texts written in Nôm (but also classical Chinese texts from Vietnam) is conducted by the [[Institute of Hán-Nôm Studies]] in [[Hanoi]].

==Etymology==
The Vietnamese word ''chữ'' (character) is derived from the [[Old Chinese]] word 字, meaning 'character'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tài Cẩn |date=1995 |title=Giáo trình lịch sử ngữ âm tiếng Việt (sơ thảo) |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Giáo dục |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Nôm'' in ''chữ Nôm'' means 'Southern', and is derived from the [[Middle Chinese]] word 南, meaning 'south'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Khuê |date=2009 |title=Chữ Nôm: cơ sở và nâng cao |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |pages=5, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways to write the name ''chữ Nôm'' in chữ Nôm characters. The word ''chữ'' may be written as 字, 𫳘(⿰字宁), 𪧚(⿰字守), 𡨸, 茡, 芓, 𫿰(⿰字文), 𡦂, 佇 or 宁, while ''Nôm'' may be written as 喃 or 諵.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vũ |first=Văn Kính |date=2005 |title=Đại tự điển chữ Nôm |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn nghệ Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |pages=293, 899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nguyễn |first1=Hữu Vinh |last2=Đặng |first2=Thế Kiệt |last3=Nguyễn |first3=Doãn Vượng |last4=Lê |first4=Văn Đặng |last5=Nguyễn |first5=Văn Sâm |last6=Nguyễn |first6=Ngọc Bích |last7=Trần |first7=Uyên Thi |date=2009 |title=Tự điển chữ Nôm trích dẫn |publisher=Viện Việt-học |pages=[http://www.vietnamtudien.org/chunom-trichdan/tr0248.png 248], [http://www.vietnamtudien.org/chunom-trichdan/tr0249.png 249], [http://www.vietnamtudien.org/chunom-trichdan/tr0866.png 866]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of writing in Vietnam}}
''Chữ Nôm'' is the logographic writing system of the Vietnamese language. It is based on the Chinese writing system but adds a high number of new characters to make it fit the Vietnamese language.

In Vietnamese, Chinese characters are called ''chữ Hán'' (字漢 ‘Han characters’), ''Hán tự'' (漢字 ‘Han characters’), ''Hán văn'' (漢文 ‘Han characters’), or ''chữ nho'' (字儒 ‘Confucian characters’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tài Cẩn |date=2001 |title=Nguồn gốc và quá trình hình thành cách đọc Hán Việt |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học quốc gia Hà Nội |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hội Khai-trí tiến-đức |date=1954 |title=Việt-nam tự-điển |publisher=Văn Mới |pages=141, 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Đào |first=Duy Anh |date=2005 |title=Hán-Việt từ-điển giản yếu |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn hoá Thông tin |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hán văn'' (漢文) also means Chinese language literature (in this case, ''Hán văn'' literally means ‘Han literature’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hội Khai-trí tiến-đức |date=1954 |title=Việt-nam tự-điển |publisher=Văn Mới |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Đào |first=Duy Anh |date=2005 |title=Hán-Việt từ-điển giản yếu |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn hoá Thông tin |pages=281, 900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Hán Nôm'' (漢喃 ‘Han and chữ Nôm characters’)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trần |first=Văn Chánh |date=January 2012 |title=Tản mạn kinh nghiệm học chữ Hán cổ|journal=Suối Nguồn, tập 3&amp;4 |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Tổng hợp Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Vietnamese designates the whole body of Vietnamese premodern written materials, either written in Chinese (''chữ hán'') or in Vietnamese (''chữ Nôm'').&lt;ref&gt;Asian research trends: a humanities and social science review – No 8 to 10 – Page 140 Yunesuko Higashi Ajia Bunka Kenkyū Sentā (Tokyo, Japan) – 1998 "Most of the source materials from premodern Vietnam are written in Chinese, obviously using Chinese characters; however, a portion of the literary genre is written in Vietnamese, using chu nom. Therefore, han nom is the term designating the whole body of premodern written materials.."&lt;/ref&gt; Hán and Nôm could also be found in the same document side by side,&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Courier 1984 Vol20/21 Page 63 "Altogether about 15,000 books in Han, Nom and Han—Nom have been collected. These books include royal certificates granted to deities, stories and records of deities, clan histories, family genealogies, records of cutsoms, land registers, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; for example, in the case of translations of books on [[Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Khắc Mạnh Trịnh, ''Nghiên cứu chữ Nôm: Kỷ yếu Hội nghị Quốc tế về chữ Nôm''
Viện nghiên cứu Hán Nôm (Vietnam), Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation – 2006 "The Di sản Hán Nôm notes 366 entries which are solely on either medicine or pharmacy; of these 186 are written in Chinese, 50 in Nôm, and 130 in a mixture of the two scripts. Many of these entries ... Vietnam were written in either Nôm or Hán-Nôm rather than in 'pure' Chinese. My initial impression was that the percentage of texts written in Nôm was even higher. This is because for the particular medical subject I wished to investigate-[[smallpox]]-the percentage of texts written in Nom or Hán-Nôm is even higher than is the percentage of texts in Nôm and Hán-Nôm for general medical and pharmaceutical .."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhist]] history ''Cổ Châu Pháp Vân phật bản hạnh ngữ lục'' (1752) gives the story of early [[Buddhism in Vietnam]] both in Hán script and in a parallel Nôm translation.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn Wilcox ''Vietnam and the West: New Approaches'' 2010- Page 31 "At least one Buddhist text, the Cổ Châu Pháp Vân phật bản hạnh ngữ lục (CCPVP), preserves a story in Hán script about the early years of Buddhist influence in Vietnam and gives a parallel Nôm translation."&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit [[Girolamo Maiorica]] (1605–1656) had also used parallel Hán and Nôm texts.

The term ''chữ quốc ngữ'' ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:𡨸|𡨸]][[wikt:國|國]][[wikt:語|語]]}} "national language script") refers to the [[romanized]] [[writing system]] based on the [[Vietnamese alphabet]].

== History ==
[[File:Tu duc thanh che tu hoc giai nghia ca.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from ''Tự Đức Thánh Chế Tự Học Giải Nghĩa Ca'' ({{vi-nom|嗣德聖製字學解義歌}}), a 19th-century primer for teaching Vietnamese children Chinese characters. The work is attributed to Emperor [[Tự Đức]], the 4th Emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty. In this primer, chữ Nôm is used to gloss the Chinese characters, for example, {{vi-nom|𡗶}} is used to gloss {{vi-nom|天}}.]]
Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the [[Han dynasty]] conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but [[Literary Chinese]] was adopted for official purposes in 1010.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=78–79, 82}} For most of the period up to the early 20th century, formal writing was indistinguishable from contemporaneous classical Chinese works produced in China, Korea, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Marr141"&gt;{{harvnb|Marr|1984|p=141}}: "Because the Chinese characters were pronounced according to Vietnamese preferences, and because certain stylistic modifications occurred over time, later scholars came to refer to a hybrid "Sino-Vietnamese" (Han-Viet) language. However, there would seem to be no more justification for this term than for a fifteenth-century "Latin-English" versus the Latin written contemporaneously in Rome."&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese scholars were thus intimately familiar with Chinese writing.  In order to record their native language, they applied the structural principles of Chinese characters to develop ''chữ Nôm''.  The new script was mostly used to record folk songs and for other popular literature.{{sfn|Marr|1984|p=141}}  Vietnamese written in ''chữ Nôm'' briefly replaced Chinese for official purposes under the [[Hồ dynasty]] (1400–1407) and under the [[Tây Sơn]] (1778–1802), but in both cases this was swiftly reversed.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|pp=32, 38}}

===Earliest evidence===

The use of Chinese characters to write the Vietnamese language can be traced to an inscription with the two characters "{{vi-nom|[[:wikt:布|布]][[:wikt:蓋|蓋]]}}", as part of the posthumous title of [[Phùng Hưng]], a national hero who succeeded in expelling the Chinese, albeit briefly in the late 8th century. These two characters literally mean "cloth" + "cover" in Chinese but when pronounced by the Vietnamese, the phonetic value is employed to represent ''vua cái'' ("great king"), or archaic Vietnamese ''bố cái'' ("father and mother", i.e. as respectable as one's parents). During the 10th century, the founder of the [[Đinh dynasty]] (968-979) named the country ''Đại Cồ Việt ''({{vi-nom|[[:wikt:大|大]][[:wikt:瞿|瞿]][[:wikt:越|越]]}}). The second character of this title is another early example of using Chinese characters to represent Vietnamese native words, although which word it represents is still debated.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|pp=21–23}}&lt;ref&gt;Keith Weller Taylor ''The Birth of Vietnam'' 1976 – Page 220 "The earliest example of Vietnamese character writing, as we have noted earlier, is for the words bo and cai in the posthumous title given to Phung Hung. Although Vietnamese character writing was eventually developed for literary purposes"&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving objects with chữ Nôm inscriptions are a stele (1209) at Bảo Ân temple containing 18 characters naming villages and people, and a stele at Hộ Thành Sơn in [[Ninh Bình Province]] (1343), listing 20 villages.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurence C. Thompson A Vietnamese Reference Grammar 1987 Page 53 "This stele at Ho-thành-sơn is the earliest irrefutable piece of evidence of this writing system, which is called in Vietnamese chữ nôm (chu 'written word', nom 'popular language', probably ultimately related to nam 'south'-note that the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first literary writing in Vietnamese is said to have been an [[incantation]] in verse composed in 1282 by the Minister of Justice [[Nguyễn Thuyên]] and thrown into the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] to expel a menacing [[crocodile]].{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|p=23}} The oldest Nom text that is still extant is the collected poetry of Emperor [[Trần Nhân Tông]] written in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{vi}} Trần Nhân Tông, ''[[s:vi:Cư trần lạc đạo phú|Cư trần lạc đạo phú]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hồ dynasty (1400–07) and Ming conquest (1407–27)===

During the seven years of the [[Hồ dynasty]] (1400–07) Classical Chinese was discouraged in favor of vernacular Vietnamese written in chữ Nôm, which became the official script. The emperor [[Hồ Quý Ly]] even ordered the translation of the [[Book of Documents]] into Nôm and pushed for reinterpretation of Confucian thoughts in his book ''Minh đạo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nguoiduatin.vn/nhin-lai-cuoc-cai-cach-cua-ho-quy-ly-600-nam-truoc-a59764.html "Reexamining the Reforms of Hồ Quý Ly 600 years ago"]&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were reversed with the fall of the Hồ and [[fourth Chinese domination|Chinese conquest of 1407]], lasting twenty years, during which use of the vernacular language and demotic script were suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hannas|1997|p=83}}: "An exception was during the brief Hồ dynasty (1400–07), when Chinese was abolished and chữ Nôm became the official script, but the subsequent Chinese invasion and twenty-year occupation put an end to that (Helmut Martin 1982:34)."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ming dynasty occupation of Vietnam]], chữ Nôm printing blocks, texts and inscriptions were thoroughly destroyed; as a result the earliest surviving texts of chữ Nôm post-date the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen ''Culture and Customs of Vietnam'' 2001 Page 68  –  "In part because of the ravages of the Ming occupation — the invaders destroyed or removed many Viet texts and the blocks for printing them — the earliest body of nom texts that we have dates from the early post-occupation era ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lê (1428–1788), Tây Sơn (1788–1802) and Nguyễn dynasties (1802–1945) ===
[[File:Nhật dụng thường đàm, p. 38.jpg|thumb|A page from the bilingual dictionary ''Nhật dụng thường đàm'' (1851). Characters representing words in ''Hán'' (Chinese) are explained in ''Nôm'' (Vietnamese).]]
Among the earlier works in Nôm of this era are the writings of [[Nguyễn Trãi]] (1380–1442).&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a2TerRF1j74C&amp;dq= Culture and Customs of Vietnam]'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p.  68.&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus of Nôm writings grew over time as did more scholarly compilations of the script itself. [[Trịnh Thị Ngọc Trúc]], consort of King [[Lê Thần Tông]], is generally given credit for ''{{lang|vi|[[Chỉ nam ngọc âm giải nghĩa]]}}'' (the Explication of the Guide to Jeweled Sounds), a 24,000-character bilingual Han-to-Nom [[dictionary]] compiled between the 15th and 18th centuries, most likely in 1641 or 1761.&lt;ref name=chu&gt;Viết Luân Chu, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-XZuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= Thanh Hóa, thế và lực mới trong thế kỷ XXI]'', 2003, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phan 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chữ Nôm and the Taming of the South: A Bilingual Defense for Vernacular Writing in the ''{{lang|vi|Chỉ Nam Ngọc Âm Giải Nghĩa|nocat=true}}''|first=John|last=Phan|journal=[[Journal of Vietnamese Studies]]|location=Oakland, California|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|volume=8|issue=1|page=1|jstor=10.1525/vs.2013.8.1.1|doi=10.1525/vs.2013.8.1.1|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While almost all official writings and documents continued to be written in [[classical Chinese]] until the early 20th century, Nôm was the preferred script for literary compositions of the cultural elites. Nôm reached its golden period with the Nguyễn dynasty in the 19th century as it became a vehicle for diverse genres, from novels to theatrical pieces, and instructional manuals. Apogees of Vietnamese literature emerged with [[Nguyễn Du]]'s ''[[The Tale of Kiều]]''&lt;ref&gt;B. N. Ngô "The Vietnamese Language Learning Framework" – ''Journal of Southeast Asian Language and Teaching'', 2001 "... to a word, is most frequently represented by combining two Chinese characters, one of which indicates the sound and the other the meaning. From the fifteenth to the nineteenth century many major works of Vietnamese poetry were composed in chữ nôm, including Truyện Kiều"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hồ Xuân Hương]]'s poetry. Although literacy in premodern Vietnam was limited to just 3 to 5 percent of the population,{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=78}} nearly every village had someone who could read Nom aloud for the benefit of other villagers.{{sfn|Marr|1984|p=142}} Thus these Nôm works circulated orally in the villages, making it accessible even to the illiterates.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|pp=44-46}}

In 1838, [[Jean-Louis Taberd]] compiled a Nom dictionary, helping with the standardization of the script.&lt;ref name="Taberd"&gt;Taberd, J.L., ''[http://staging.nomfoundation.org/taberd/ Dictionarium Anamitico-Latinum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626064515/http://staging.nomfoundation.org/taberd/ |date=2013-06-26 }}'', 1838. This is a revision of a dictionary by Pierre-Joseph [[Pigneau de Béhain]] compiled in 1772–1773 and reprinted in 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, Catholic scholar [[Nguyễn Trường Tộ]] made the bold move to petition the Emperor [[Tự Đức]] to adopt Nôm as the official script. The court failed to make a break with chu Nho but Nôm did gain some sanction as ''Quốc Âm'', i.e. the national speech.&lt;ref name="Dinh"&gt;Quyen Vuong Dinh, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uB2OAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= Văn bản quản lý nhà nước và công tác công văn, giấy tờ thời phong kiến Việt Nam]'', 2002, p. 50. The decree is entitled, ''Xin khoan dung Quốc Âm'' ("Please respect the national voice.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Indochina and the Latin alphabet===
From the latter half of the 19th century onwards, the [[Cochinchina|French colonial authorities]] discouraged or simply banned the use of classical Chinese, and promoted the use of the Vietnamese alphabet, which they viewed as a stepping stone toward learning French. Language reform movements in other Asian nations stimulated Vietnamese interest in the subject. Following the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905, Japan was increasingly cited as a model for modernization. The Confucian education system was compared unfavorably to the Japanese system of public education. According to a polemic by writer [[Phan Châu Trinh]], "so-called Confucian scholars" lacked knowledge of the modern world, as well as real understanding of Han literature. Their degrees showed only that they had learned how to write characters, he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Phan Châu Trinh, "Monarchy and Democracy", ''Phan Châu Trinh and His Political Writings'', SEAP Publications, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-87727-749-1}}, p. 126. This is a translation of a lecture Chau gave in Saigon in 1925. "Even at this moment, the so-called "Confucian scholars (i.e. those who have studied Chinese characters, and in particular, those who have passed the degrees of ''cử nhân'' [bachelor] and ''tiến sĩ'' [doctorate]) do not know anything, I am sure, of Confucianism. Yet every time they open their mouths they use Confucianism to attack modern civilization – a civilization they do not comprehend even a tiny bit."&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Hanoi's short-lived [[Tonkin Free School]] suggested that broad reform was possible. In 1910, the colonial school system adopted a "Franco-Vietnamese curriculum", which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese. The teaching of Chinese characters was discontinued in 1917.&lt;ref name="Chung"&gt;{{vi}} Phùng Thành Chủng, "[http://damau.org/archives/10281 Hướng tới 1000 năm Thăng Long-Hà Nội]", November 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 28, 1918, Emperor [[Khải Định]] declared that the traditional writing system no longer had official status.&lt;ref name="Chung" /&gt; The traditional Civil Service Examination, which emphasized the command of classical Chinese, was dismantled in 1915 in [[Tonkin]] and was given for the last time at the imperial capital of [[Huế]] on January 4, 1919.&lt;ref name="Chung" /&gt; The examination system, and the education system based on it, had been in effect for almost 900 years.&lt;ref name="Chung" /&gt; &lt;!--China itself abandoned the imperial examinations soon afterward as part of the [[May Fourth Movement]].--&gt;

The decline of the Chinese script also led to the decline of chữ Nôm given that Nôm and Chinese characters are so intimately connected.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|p=179}} During the early half of the 20th century, chữ Nôm gradually died out as quốc ngữ grew more and more standardized and popular. In an article published in 1935 by Cordier he stated that quốc ngữ is rapidly dethroning Chinese characters and is replacing chữ Nôm so that by 1935 out of one hundred literate persons 70 knew quốc ngữ, 20 knew chữ Nôm and 10 knew Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="Cordier"&gt;Cordier, Georges (1935), [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5658111f/f127 ''Les trois écritures utilisées en Annam: chu-nho, chu-nom et quoc-ngu (conférence faite à l'Ecole Coloniale, à Paris, le 28 mars 1925)''], Bulletin de la Société d'Enseignement Mutuel du Tonkin 15: 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
The syntax of nôm naturally follows [[Vietnamese grammar]] not [[Chinese grammar]]. For example, in nôm texts the [[Trịnh]] lords (1545–1787) are Chúa Trịnh (chữ Nôm: {{vi-nom|主鄭}}) not as in Sino-Vietnamese Trịnh vương (chữ Hán: {{vi-nom|鄭王}}). Here the character used (lord in Vietnamese, king in Chinese) is also different, but the difference in syntax is that in Vietnamese the noun "lord" precedes the name, whereas in Chinese "king" follows the name.

A similar example, in Vietnamese [[Truyện Kiều]] ({{vi-nom|傳翹}}, lit. "Tale of Kiều") the word "tale" precedes the name, but in Chinese syntax "tale" (''truyện'' {{vi-nom|[[:wikt:傳|傳]]}}) should follow the name Kiều. The nôm term "chữ Nôm" itself is an example of this. In Vietnamese nôm syntax the noun "script" ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:𡨸|𡨸]]}}) precedes "Southern" ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:喃|喃]]}}), whereas in chữ Hán the order is reversed and a purely Chinese chữ Hán character used instead of the locally created Chữ (chữ Hán: {{vi-nom|喃字}}). Similarly with gods and heroes; the syntax of the popular name [[Thánh Gióng]] ({{vi-nom|聖容}}) differes from his chữ Hán name Phù Đổng Thiên Vương ({{vi-nom|扶董天王}}); the nôm name [[Mẫu Thoải]] ({{vi-nom|母水}}), has a Vietnamese syntax while her chữ Hán name Thủy cung Thánh Mẫu ({{vi-nom|水宮聖母}}) exhibits Chinese syntax. The official Chinese [[Tên chữ]] and vernacular [[Tên nôm]] for village names may also have different syntax as well as different characters.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Guillaume La Terre du Dragon Tome 2 – Page 59 "Elle comprenait en général un village principal (Xa) et les hameaux environnants (Làng). Le village viêtnamien possédait alors deux noms : un nom courant ou vulgaire (Tên Nôm) et un nom littéraire réservé à l'administration (Tên Chu)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese poems translated into Nôm could retain more Chinese syntax and poetic forms than those translated into Korean or Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia History of Chinese Literature -Victor H. Mair – 2012  Page 1097 -"Chinese vocabulary was largely kept in place even in poetic writings in Vietnamese using chu nom (adapted from the sinographs) phonetics. Chinese poetic forms could be maintained without the radical restructuring required by translation to a foreign syntax required in Japan and Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; Though as literature in Nôm developed it increasingly freed itself from Chinese syntax.&lt;ref&gt;The Vietnamese novel in French: a literary response to colonialism -Jack Andrew Yeager, University of New Hampshire – 1987  Page 30 "Nom would eventually free itself of the influence of Chinese syntax and, with the gradual hardening of Confucian philosophy, become more important than Chinese for literary production in Viet Nam. By the eighteenth century, important ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
In chữ Nôm, each monosyllabic word of Vietnamese was represented by a character, either borrowed from Chinese or locally created.
There was no development of a [[syllabary]] like Japanese [[kana]] or Korean [[hangul]]; in part due to the [[analytic language|analytic nature]] of Vietnamese, similar to Chinese, as opposed to the [[agglutinative]] morphology of Japanese and Korean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marr|1984|pp=141–142}}: "By the same token, some women developed word skills to the point where they could outmatch any male participants — much to the delight of their peers.9 Partly as a means to capture Vietnamese folklore in writing, the literati gradually improvised a separate ideographic system to accord with the sounds and syntax of the spoken language.10 known subsequently as nom, this unique Vietnamese script unfortunately remained even more unwieldy than the Chinese from which it was spawned. Unlike Japanese kana or Korean Hangul/no process of character simplification that resulted in a basic set of phonemes or syllables. Some of the problem lay in the tonal and nonagglutinative nature of Vietnamese as contrasted with Japanese or Korean.11 More important, however, was the attitude of most Vietnamese literati, who continued to regard Chinese as the ultimate in civilized communication and thus considered nom a form of recreation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borrowed characters===
{{see also|Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese reading|Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters}}
Unmodified Chinese characters were used in chữ Nôm in three different ways.

A large proportion of Vietnamese vocabulary had been borrowed from Chinese from the Tang period.
Such [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] could be written with the original Chinese character for each word, for example:{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=80–81}}
* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|役}}}} ''dịch'' ("service", "corvée"), from Early [[Middle Chinese]] (EMC) /jwiajk/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=371}}
* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|本}}}} ''bản'' ("root", "foundation"), from EMC /pən'/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=32}}
* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|頭}}}} ''đầu'' ("head"), from EMC /dəw/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=311}}
To represent a native Vietnamese word, one method was to use a Chinese character for a Chinese word with a similar meaning. For example, {{vi-nom|本}} may also represent ''vốn'' ("capital, funds"). When a character would have two readings, a diacritic may be added to the character to indicate the "indigenous" reading. Thus when {{vi-nom|本}} is meant to be read as ''vốn'', it is written as {{vi-nom|本㆑}}, with a diacritic at the upper right corner. In this case the word ''vốn'' is actually an earlier Chinese loan that has become accepted as Vietnamese; William Hannas claims that all such readings are similar early loans.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=80–81}}

Alternatively, a native Vietnamese word could be written using a Chinese character for a Chinese word with a similar sound, regardless of the meaning of the Chinese word. For example, {{vi-nom|{{linktext|沒}}}} (Early Middle Chinese /mət/{{sfn|Pulleyblank|1991|p=218}}) may represent the Vietnamese word ''một'' ("one").{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=80}}

To draw an analogy to the [[Japanese writing system]], the first two categories are similar to the ''[[on'yomi|on]]'' and [[kun'yomi|''kun'' reading]]s of Japanese [[Kanji#Readings|kanji]] respectively. The third is similar to ''[[ateji]]'', in which characters are used only for their sound value, or the [[Man'yōgana]] script that became the origin of [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].

===Locally invented characters===
[[File:Nom Character V04-5055.svg|thumb|right|upright|The Nom character for ''[[pho|phở]]'' ({{linktext|𬖾|}}), a popular soup made from rice noodles, was added to the Unicode 8.0 as part of CJK Unified Ideographs Extended-E (𬖾, U+2C5BE).{{efn|The character is part of the proposed set for Extension E. See "[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4358-A.pdf Code Charts - CJK Ext. E]", (N4358-A), JTC1/SC2/WG2, Oct. 10, 2012, p. 5. The V Source code is V04-5055.}} The radical {{vi-nom|{{linktext|米}}}} on the left suggests that the meaning of the character is linked to rice. The phonetic component {{vi-nom|{{linktext|頗}}}} on the right suggests that the pronunciation of the character is linked to that of 頗 ''phở'', and in this case the character's pronunciation and that of its phonetic component is the same.]]
In contrast to the few hundred Japanese [[kokuji]] and handful of Korean [[gukja]], which are mostly rarely used characters for indigenous natural phenomena, Vietnamese scribes created thousands of new characters, used throughout the language.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=79}}

Similar to the Chinese writing system, the most common kind of invented character in Nom is the phono-semantic compound, made by combining two characters or components, one suggesting the word's meaning and the other its approximate sound. For example,{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=81}}
* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|𠀧}}}} (''ba'' "three") is composed of the phonetic part {{vi-nom|{{linktext|巴}}}} (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''ba'') and the semantic part {{vi-nom|{{linktext|三}}}} "three". "Father" is also ''ba'', but written as {{vi-nom|{{linktext|爸}} (⿱{{linktext|父|巴}}}}), while "turtle" is ''con ba ba'' {{vi-nom|{{linktext|昆|蚆|蚆}}}}.
* {{vi-nom|{{linktext|媄}}}} (''mẹ'' "mother") has {{vi-nom|{{linktext|女}}}} "woman" as semantic component and {{vi-nom|{{linktext|美}}}} (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''mỹ'') as phonetic component.{{efn|The character 媄 is also used in Chinese as an alternate form of 美 "beautiful".}}

A smaller group consists of semantic compound characters, which are composed of two Chinese characters representing words of similar meaning. For example, {{vi-nom|{{linktext|𡗶}}}} (''giời'' or ''trời'' "sky", "heaven") is composed of {{vi-nom|{{linktext|天}}}} ("sky") and {{vi-nom|{{linktext|上}}}} ("upper").{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=81}}

A few characters were obtained by modifying Chinese characters related either semantically or phonetically to the word to be represented. For example,
* the Nôm character {{vi-nom|{{linktext|𧘇}}}} (''ấy'' "that', "those") is a simplified form of the Chinese character {{vi-nom|{{linktext|衣}}}} (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''ý'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Khuê |date=2009 |title=Chữ Nôm: cơ sở và nâng cao |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Nôm character 爫 (làm "work", "labour") is a simplified form of the Chinese character 濫 (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''lạm'') (濫 &gt; 氵&lt;u&gt;爫&lt;/u&gt; &gt; 爫).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Khuê |date=2009 |title=Chữ Nôm: cơ sở và nâng cao |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Nôm character 𠬠 (một ‘one’) comes from the right part of the Chinese character 没 (Sino-Vietnamese reading: ''một'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vũ |first=Văn Kính |date=2005 |title=Đại tự điển chữ Nôm |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn nghệ Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korea and Japan, phonetic systems were developed so that Chinese characters could be taught to the general public.&lt;ref name="Marr141-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Marr|1984|pp=141–142}}: "Known subsequently as ''nom'', this unique Vietnamese script unfortunately remained even more unwieldy than the Chinese from which it was spawned. Unlike Japanese ''kana'' or Korean ''hangul'', there was no process of character simplification that resulted in a basic set of phonemes or syllables."&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam's educated class looked down on Nom as inferior to Han, so they were not interested in doing the work required to turn Nom into a form of writing suitable for mass communication.&lt;ref name="Marr142"&gt;{{harvnb|Marr|1984|p=142}}: "More important, however, was the attitude of most Vietnamese literati, who continued to regard Chinese as the ultimate in civilized communication and thus considered ''nom'' a form of recreation...Meanwhile, the minority of the literati who took ''nom'' writing seriously had to be careful not to offend the fraternity or be accused of subversion through circulating 'vulgar' texts."&lt;/ref&gt; Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language and has nearly 5,000 distinct syllables.{{sfn|Hannas|1997|pp=78–79, 82}} Neither the Korean nor the Japanese writing systems indicate tones, so they cannot be accurately applied to the Vietnamese language without significant modifications to their systems.&lt;ref name="Marr141" /&gt;

===Most common characters===
The website chunom.org gives a frequency table of the 586 most common characters in Nom literature. According to this table, the most common 50 characters are as follows, with the modern spelling given in italics:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chunom.org/charsets/ Comparison of Character Sets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616023959/http://www.chunom.org/charsets/ |date=2013-06-16 }}, chunom.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standardization===
In 1867, the reformist [[Nguyễn Trường Tộ]] proposed a standardization of chữ Nôm (along with the abolition of classical Chinese), but the new system, what he called ''quốc âm Hán tự'' ({{vi-nom|國音漢字}} lit. "Han characters with national pronunciations"), was rejected by Emperor Tự Đức.{{sfn|DeFrancis|1977|pp=101-105}} To this date, chữ Nôm has never been officially standardized. As a result, a Vietnamese word can be represented by variant Nôm characters. For example, the very word ''chữ'' ("character", "script"), a Chinese loan word, can be written as either {{vi-nom|{{linktext|字}}}} (Chinese character), {{vi-nom|𡦂}} (invented character, "compound-semantic") or {{vi-nom|𡨸}} (invented character, "semantic-phonetic"). For another example, the word ''béo'' ("fat", "greasy") can be written either as {{vi-nom|脿}} or {{vi-nom|[[File:Chu nom fat.svg|18px|⿰月報]]}}. Both characters are invented characters with a semantic-phonetic structure, the difference being the phonetic indicator ({{vi-nom|{{linktext|表}}}} vs. {{vi-nom|{{linktext|報}}}}).

From 2013, Han-Nom Revival Committee of Vietnam, an internet-based organization has started its standardization work for Chữ [[Hán Nôm]]. Aiming at both chữ Nôm and [[Chữ Hán]] standardization, the Committee's "Chữ Hán Nôm Standardization Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannom-rcv.org/wi/index.php?title=%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E5%8C%96:%E4%BB%8B%E7%B4%B9 標準化:介紹 – 韋那威箕（VI NA UY KI）・委班復生漢喃越南]&lt;/ref&gt;" is designed to determine the Standard chữ Nôm among many variant Nôm characters, to confirm the usage of chữ Nôm and Chữ Hán in [[:vi:Từ thuần Việt|Pure Vietnamese words]], [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese words]] (especially Vietnamese-made Sino-Vietnamese words), and [[:vi:Tiếng Việt#Từ hỗn chủng|Hybrid words]], as well as to determine the chữ Nôm and Chữ Hán characters in [[Loan words]] for phonetic transliteration. Till 2015, based on discussions among many specialists of Chữ Hán Nôm, around 500 frequently-used Chữ Hán Nôm are determined and published on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannom-rcv.org/wi/index.php?title=%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E5%8C%96:%E9%9F%B3%E7%AF%80%E9%80%9A%E5%B8%B8 標準化:音節通常 – 韋那威箕（VI NA UY KI）・委班復生漢喃越南]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer encoding==
In 1993, the Vietnamese government released an 8-bit coding standard for alphabetic Vietnamese (TCVN 5712:1993, or VSCII), as well as a 16-bit standard for Nom (TCVN 5773:1993).&lt;ref&gt;Luong Van Phan, "[http://www.cicc.or.jp/japanese/hyoujyunka/j-af15/15-21.pdf Country Report on Current Status and Issues of e-government Vietnam – Requirements for Documentation Standards]". The character list for the 1993 standard is given in [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~nhan/npct-2.1.pdf Nôm Proper Code Table: Version 2.1] by Ngô Thanh Nhàn.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of glyphs is referred to as "V0." In 1994, the [[Ideographic Rapporteur Group]] agreed to include Nom characters as part of [[Unicode]].&lt;ref name=unicode&gt;"[https://www.unicode.org/uni2book/appA.pdf Han Unification History]", ''The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A revised standard, TCVN 6909:2001, defines 9,299 glyphs.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; About half of these glyphs are specific to Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;{{vi}} Nguyễn Quang Hồng, "[http://nomfoundation.org/vn/du-an-nom/Kho-chu-Han-Nom-ma-hoa/Gioi-thieu-Kho-chu-Han-Nom-ma-hoa Giới thiệu Kho chữ Hán Nôm mã hoá]" [Hán Nôm Coded Character Repertoire Introduction], ''Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nom characters not already encoded were added to [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B|&lt;abbr title="Chinese/Japanese/Korean"&gt;CJK&lt;/abbr&gt; Unified Ideographs Extension B]].&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; (These characters have five-digit [[hexadecimal]] code points. The characters that were encoded earlier have four-digit hex.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5478">A '''Cluster diagram''' or ''clustering diagram'' is a general type of [[diagram]], which represents some kind of cluster. A cluster in general is a group or bunch of several discrete items that are close to each other.

The cluster diagram figures a cluster, such as a network diagram figures a [[computer network|network]], a flow diagram a process or movement of objects, and a tree diagram an abstract [[tree]]. But all these diagrams can be considered interconnected: A network diagram can be seen as a special orderly arranged kind of cluster diagram. A cluster diagram is a [[Mesh networking|mesh]] kind of network diagram. A [[wikt:flow diagram|flow diagram]] can be seen as a [[wikt:line|line]] type of network diagram, and a [[tree structure|tree diagram]] a [[Tree and hypertree networks|tree]] type of network diagram.

== Types of cluster diagrams ==
Specific types of cluster diagrams are:

In the field of psychology, '''cognitive dissonance''' is the [[Stress (psychological)|mental discomfort]] (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory [[belief]]s, [[idea]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]. This discomfort is triggered by a situation in which a person’s belief clashes with new evidence perceived by that person. When confronted with facts that contradict personal beliefs, ideals, and values, people will find a way to resolve the contradiction in order to reduce their discomfort.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance''. California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive dissonance | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4| pages = 93–107 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance'' (1957), [[Leon Festinger]] proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the [[Reality|real world]]. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;

== Relations among cognitions ==
To function in the [[reality]] of a modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;
# Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine)
# Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, and wearing a shirt)
# Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine)

=== Magnitude of dissonance ===
The reduction of the [[psychological stress]] of cognitive dissonance is a function of the magnitude of the dissonance caused by the existential inconsistency, between two contradictory beliefs held by the person; or by the contradiction between the person's beliefs and an action he or she has taken.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:
# The importance of cognitions: The greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation.
# Ratio of cognitions: The proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements.

== Reduction==
Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their personal expectations of life and the existential [[reality]] of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.

The creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen his or her mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realised either by changing with or by justifying against, or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt; In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:
# Change the behavior or the cognition ("I'll eat no more of this doughnut.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition ("I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new cognitions ("I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.")
# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.")

Three cognitive biases in particular are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is "better, kinder, smarter, more moral, and nicer than average," and [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tavris |first1=Carol |authorlink1=Carol Tavris |last2=Aronson |first2=Elliot |authorlink2=Elliot Aronson |title=Why We Believe -- Long After We Shouldn't |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=51-53 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105182429/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of ''The Psychology of Prejudice'' (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.

Likewise, the study ''Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey'' (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking tobacco.

# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.)
# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.)
#Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.)

To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:

# Functional beliefs ("Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset."; "Smoking helps me concentrate better."; "Smoking is an important part of my life."; and "Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.")
# Risk-minimizing beliefs ("The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated."; "One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?"; and "Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.")&lt;ref&gt;Fotuhi, Omid, et al.  Tobacco control (2012): tobaccocontrol-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms==
There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior [[belief]]s, [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.

===Belief disconfirmation===
The disconfirmation (contradiction) of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the belief under contradiction; yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person, by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction; seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs; or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, Eddie, "A Cognitive Dissonance Theory Perspective on Persuasion", in ''The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice'', James Price Dillard, Michael Pfau, Eds. 2002. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Kracht|Kracht, C.]], &amp; [[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], [http://www.wehrhahn-verlag.de/index.php?section=abisz&amp;subsection=details&amp;id=577 ''Five Years, Vol. 1''] ([[Hannover]]: [[:de:Wehrhahn Verlag|Wehrhahn Verlag]], 2011), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early hypothesis of belief disconfirmation presented in ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]'' (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth, to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance, between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, [[Reality|material reality]], most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing. That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. Moreover, upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers, by successful [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S. ''When Prophecy Fails'' (1956). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference'' (2008) reported the belief disconfirmation occurred to the ''[[Chabad]]'' Orthodox Jewish congregation who believed that their [[Rebbe]] (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. Yet, when he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that [[Chabad messianism#The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death|Schneerson was the Messiah]], and that he would soon return from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, David (2008). ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference''. Portland: Litman Library of Jewish Civilization.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced compliance===
{{see also|Forced compliance theory}}
In the ''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'' (1959), the investigators Festinger and [[Merrill Carlsmith]] asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.

[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|After performing dissonant behavior ([[lie|lying]]) a person might find external, consonant elements. Therefore, a [[snake oil]] salesman might find a psychological self-justification (great profit) for promoting medical falsehoods, but, otherwise, might need to change his beliefs about the falsehoods.]]

At the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: "I told someone that the task was interesting" and "I actually found it boring." Moreover, the subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the "interesting task" mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the "interesting task" mental attitude and, thus, experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Forbidden Behaviour paradigm
In the ''Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior'' (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by [[Elliot Aronson]] and Carlsmith, examined [[self-justification]] in children.&lt;ref name="aronson1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1963 | title = Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 584–588 | doi = 10.1037/h0039901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).&lt;ref name= "aronson1963"/&gt;

Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.&lt;ref name=aronson1963 /&gt;

In ''The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance'' (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name=MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep00694|title=The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|volume=2|year=2012|last1=Masataka|first1=Nobuo|last2=Perlovsky|first2=Leonid |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00694.pdf}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played alone. In that group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance"/&gt;

Moreover, music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, ''Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance'' (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee |first1=Spike W. S. |last2=Schwarz |first2=Norbert |title=Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance|journal=Science|date=May 2010|volume=328|doi=10.1126/science.1186799 |pmid=20448177 |issue=5979 |pages=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free choice===
In the study ''Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives'' (1956) 225 female students rated a series of domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of a second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brehm | first1 = J. | year = 1956 | title = Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives | doi = 10.1037/h0041006 | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 384–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of cognitive dissonance occurs to a person faced with making a difficult decision, wherein there always exist aspects of the rejected-object not chosen, which appeal to the person making the choice. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; thus, the decision "I chose X" is dissonant with the cognition that "There are some aspects of Y that I like." Moreover, the study ''Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys'' (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals.&lt;ref name="Egan et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | last3 = Santos | first3 = L.R. | year = 2010 | title = Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.08.014 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 204–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?'' (2013) indicated that, in addition to internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts individually. That social preferences and social norms are related, and function in line with wage-giving among three persons. The actions of the first person influenced{{clarify|date=October 2015}} the wage-giving actions of the second person. That inequity aversion is the paramount concern of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jeea.12015|pmid=28553193|title=Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|volume=11|issue=3|pages=548–573|year=2013|last1=Gächter|first1=Simon|last2=Nosenzo|first2=Daniele|last3=Sefton|first3=Martin|ssrn=2010940}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effort justification===
{{further|Effort justification}}
Cognitive dissonance occurs to a person when he or she voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In ''The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group'' (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.

Both groups then were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal-sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Mills | first2 = J. | year = 1956 | title = The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group | url = http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Aronson.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 177–181 | doi=10.1037/h0047195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in ''Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing'' (2006), the results indicated that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S.W.S. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5979/709 | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5979| page = 709 | doi=10.1126/science.1186799 | pmid=20448177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhong | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Liljenquist | first2 = K. | year = 2006 | title = Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing | doi = 10.1126/science.1130726 | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5792| pages = 1451–1452 | pmid=16960010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise, the study ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.

The results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on his or her attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Jarcho, J.

=== Unpleasant medical screenings ===
In the study ''Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings '' (2016), the researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the "human respiratory virus-27". The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, "We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest—this dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ent|first=Michael R.|last2=Gerend|first2=Mary A.|date=September 2016|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=21|issue=9|pages=2075–2084|doi=10.1177/1359105315570986|issn=1461-7277|pmid=27535832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications==
=== Education ===
The management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the [[motivation]] of a student to pursue education.&lt;ref name="Aronson1995"&gt;Aronson, E. (1995).'' The Social Animal'' (1995), New York: W.H. Freeman and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children’s Intrinsic Motivation'' (1975) indicated that the application of the [[effort justification]] paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward.&lt;ref name="LepperandGreene1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lepper | first1 = M.

The incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students’ [[self-awareness]] of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[values]] and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the  students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the [[psychological stress]] of the conflict between reality and the student's value system.&lt;ref name="GuzzettiSnyderGlassandGamas1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guzzetti | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Glass | first3 = G.V. | last4 = Gamas | first4 = W.S. | year = 1993 | title = Promoting Conceptual Change in Science: A Comparative Meta-analysis of Instructional Interventions from Reading Education and Science Education | journal = Reading Research Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 116–159 | jstor=747886 | doi=10.2307/747886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[educational software]] that applies the derived principles facilitates the students’ ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject.&lt;ref name="GraesserBaggettandWilliams1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graesser | first1 = A.

=== Psychotherapy ===
The general effectiveness of [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychological intervention]] is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Cooper2007"&gt;Cooper, J. (2007). Cognitive Dissonance: 50 Years of a Classic Theory. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, [[social psychology]] proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific [[therapy]] and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="CooperAxsom1982"&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Axsom, D. (1982). Integration of Clinical and Social Psychology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study ''Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children'' (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.&lt;ref name="MendoncaBrehm1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mendonca | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Brehm | first2 = S.

In the study ''Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction '' (1980), people afflicted with [[ophidiophobia]] (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their [[phobia]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = J. | year = 1980 | title = Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(80)90064-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 452–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the results of ''Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss'' (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying his or her efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight. That the therapy of effort expenditure can predict long-term change in the patient's perceptions.&lt;ref name="AxsomCooper1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axsom | first1 = D. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(85)90012-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 149–160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred.  Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group will develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).

=== Consumer behavior&lt;!-- This section is not an application of research, and is questionable regarding ethics --&gt; ===
Three  main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii)  The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer. The consumer is free to select from the alternatives, and the decision to buy is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gbadamosi|first=Ayantunji|title=Cognitive Dissonance: The Implicit Explication in Low-income Consumers' Shopping Behaviour for "Low-involvement" Grocery Products|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|date=January 2009|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1077–1095|doi= 10.1108/09590550911005038|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices '' (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii)  Engage in [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullikin|first=Lindsey J|title=Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices|journal=Journal of Products &amp; Brand Management|year=2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=140–153|doi=10.1108/10610420310476906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Cognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cognitive-dissonance-politics-prabhakar-mundkur/|title=Is there Cognitive Dissonance in Politics?|date=2016-07-11|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater.

This effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Ryan K.|last2=Joslyn|first2=Mark R.|date=2001-09-01|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Attitude Change in Six Presidential Elections|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0162-895X.00252/abstract|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–540|doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00252|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What wasn't studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. Since the U.S. 2016 election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html|title=Poll: Trump, Clinton score historic unfavorable ratings|last=CNN|first=David Wright,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it might be a good case study to examine the cognitive dissonance effects in these instances.

=== Self-perception theory===
In ''The Gestalt Theory of Motivation'' (1960), the social psychologist [[Daryl Bem]] proposed the [[self-perception theory]] whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"&gt;Heider, F. (1960). The Gestalt Theory of Motivation. Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 8, pp. 145–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'', 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: "Did you find the task interesting?", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1965 | title = An Experimental Analysis of Self-persuasion|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(65)90026-0 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 199–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1967 | title = Self-perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena | url = http://dbem.ws/SP%20Theory%20Cognitive%20Dissonance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 183–200 | doi=10.1037/h0024835 | pmid=5342882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant [[arousal]], of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zanna | first1 = M. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1974 | title = Dissonance and the Pill: An Attribution Approach to Studying the Arousal Properties of Dissonance | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1974-32359-001 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 703–709 | doi=10.1037/h0036651| pmid = 4833431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiesler | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Pallak | first2 = M.S. | year = 1976 | title = Arousal Properties of Dissonance Manipulations | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1977-21057-001 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 83 | issue = 6| pages = 1014–1025 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1014| pmid = 996211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective'' (1969), [[Elliot Aronson]] linked cognitive dissonance to the [[self-concept]]: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions "I am an honest person." and "I lied about finding the task interesting."&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 1969 pp. 1–34"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60075-1|chapter=The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=1–34|year=1969|last1=Aronson|first1=Elliot|isbn=9780120152049|publisher=Academic Press|editor-first1=Leonard |editor-last1=Berkowitz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects his or her public [[self-image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedeschi | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Schlenker | first2 = B.R. | last3 = Bonoma | first3 = T.V. | year = 1971 | title = Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 685–695 | doi = 10.1037/h0032110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the results reported in the study ''I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors'' (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coppin | first1 = G. | last2 = Delplanque | first2 = S. | last3 = Cayeux | first3 = I. | last4 = Porcherot | first4 = C. | last5 = Sander | first5 = D. | year = 2010 | title = I'm No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 489–493 | pmid = 20424088 | doi=10.1177/0956797610364115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance theory===
{{main|Balance theory}}
[[Fritz Heider]] proposed a motivational theory of attitude change that functions on the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance.  This drive is known as the consistency motive—the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time.
According to balance theory there are three things interacting: (1) you (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X).  These are each positioned at one point of a triangle and share two relations:&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"/&gt;
# ''Unit relations'' – things and people that belong together based on similarity, proximity, fate, etc.
# ''Sentiment relations'' – evaluations of people and things (liking, disliking)

As people, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among three positions; 3 positives or 2 negatives, 1 positive:
 P = you
 O = John
 X = John's dog
::"I don't like John"
::"John has a dog"
::"I don't like the dog either"

People also avoid unbalanced states of relations; 3 negatives or 2 positives, 1 negative)
 P = you
 O = your child
 X = picture your child drew
::"I love my child"
::"She drew me this picture"
::"I love this picture"

===Cost–benefit analysis===
In the study ''On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works'' (1969), [[Jules Dupuit]] reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuit, J. (1969). “On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works”, ''Readings in Welfare''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-discrepancy theory===

[[E. Tory Higgins]] proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves:

# ''Actual self'' – representation of the attributes the person believes him- or herself to possess (basic self-concept)
# ''Ideal self'' – ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change)
# ''Ought self'' – ideal attributes the person believes he or she should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities)

When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce [[self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] (the gap between two self-guides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3615707|year=1987|author1=Higgins|first1=E. T.|title=Self-discrepancy: A Theory Relating Self and Affect|journal=Psychological Review|volume=94|issue=3|pages=319–340|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS%3DPSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074101/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS%3DPSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Averse consequences vs. inconsistency===
During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60121-5|chapter=A New Look at Dissonance Theory|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=17|pages=229–266|year=1984|last1=Cooper|first1=Joel|last2=Fazio|first2=Russell H.|isbn=9780120152179|editor-first=Leonard|editor-last= Berkowitz|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they feel they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Brehm | first2 = J.W. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Simon | first4 = L. | last5 = Nelson | first5 = D.E. | year = 1996 | title = Evidence that the production of aversive consequences is not necessary to create cognitive dissonance | url = http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal96.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 5–16 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the free-choice paradigm===
In the study ''How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm'' (2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Risen | first2 = J.L. | year = 2010 | title = How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm | doi = 10.1037/a0020217 | pmid = 20658837 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 573–594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.

Although the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. ''Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence'', 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00983.x|title=Do Choices Affect Preferences?

===Action–motivation model===
The action–motivation model proposes that inconsistencies in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency interferes with the person's functioning in the [[Reality|real world]]. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.

The occurrence of cognitive dissonance produces a state of [[affect (psychology)|negative affect]], which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behaviour, in order to resolve the psychologic inconsistency that caused the mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;(Beckmann and Kuhl, 1984, Harmon-Jones, 1999, Harmon-Jones, 2000a, Jones and Gerard, 1967, McGregor et al., 1999 and Newby-Clark ''et al.'', 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; As the afflicted person works towards a behavioural commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left [[frontal cortex]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = J | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = J | year = 1984 | title = Altering Information to Gain Action Control: Functional Aspects of Human Information Processing in Decision Making | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(84)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., 1999. “Toward an Understanding of the Motivation Underlying Dissonance Processes: Is Feeling Personally Responsible for the Production of Aversive Consequences Necessary to Cause Dissonance Effects?” in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Perspectives on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology''.

P., 1999. “Epistemic Discomfort is Moderated by Simultaneous Accessibility of Inconsistent Elements”, in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Progress on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology'', Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, pp. 325–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive dissonance model===
The predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the [[predictive coding]] (or predictive processing) model of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaaronen | first1 = R.O. | year = 2018 | title = A Theory of Predictive Dissonance: Predictive Processing Presents a New Take on Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02218/full | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 9| issue = | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1177/01461672002612004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming [[proprioception|proprioceptive]], [[interoception|interoceptive]] and [[exteroception|exteroceptive]] sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine which attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of [[predictive coding|prediction error]]. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the [[overfitting]] of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizable conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.

== Neuroscience findings ==
=== Visualisation ===
The study ''Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance'' (2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Veen | first1 = V. | last2 = Krug | first2 = M.K. | last3 = Schooler | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Carter | first4 = C.S. | year = 2009 | title = Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26817210_Neural_Activity_Predicts_Attitude_Change_in_Cognitive_Dissonance/file/3deec51b8bf291652a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1469–1474 | doi=10.1038/nn.2413| pmid = 19759538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter-attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the anterior [[insular cortex]]; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"/&gt;
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|right|400px|The biomechanics of cognitive dissonance: MRI evidence indicates that the greater the psychological conflict signalled by the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the greater the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance experienced by the person.]]

As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study ''How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome'' (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the [[striatum]] changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharot | first1 = T. | last2 = De Martino | first2 = B. | last3 = Dolan | first3 = R.J. | year = 2009 | title = How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome | url = http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 3760–3765 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.4972-08.2009 | pmid = 19321772 | pmc = 2675705 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053852/http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | archivedate = 2011-06-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies such as ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010)&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarcho|first1=Johanna M.|last2=Berkman|first2=Elliot T.|last3=Lieberman|first3=Matthew D.|title=The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making|journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience|year=2010|doi=10.1093/scan/nsq054|pmid=20621961|volume=6|issue=4|pages=460–467|pmc=3150852}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification'' (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Izuma et al."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qin | first1 = J. | last2 = Kimel | first2 = S. | last3 = Kitayama | first3 = S. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Yang | first5 = X. | last6 = Han | first6 = S. | year = 2011 | title = How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.076 | pmid = 21130888 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 240–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-[[inferior frontal gyrus]], in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the [[ventral striatum]], and that neural activity decreased in the [[anterior insula]].&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt; That the neural activities of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions.&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt;

=== Emotional correlations ===
The results reported in ''Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity'' (2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the [[Frontal cortex|left frontal cortex]], a brain structure also associated with the emotion of [[anger]]; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, 1999 and 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a directional model of [[Motivation|Approach motivation]], the study ''Anger and the Behavioural Approach System'' (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2003 | title = Anger and the Behavioural Approach System | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 995–1005 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(02)00313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2004 | title = Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 67| issue = 1–2| pages = 51–76 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.003 | pmid = 15130525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept as a form of higher-level thinking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amodio | first1 = D.M | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E | last3 = Devine | first3 = P.G | last4 = Curtin | first4 = J.J | last5 = Hartley | first5 = S | year = 2004 | title = A Covert Neural signals for the control of unintentional race bias | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 88–93 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502003.x| pmid = 14738514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beauvois, J. L., Joule, R. V., 1996. A radical dissonance theory. London: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychology of mental stress ===
The results reported in ''The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys'' (2007) indicated that there might be [[Evolution|evolutionary force]] behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and [[Capuchin monkey]]s when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Santos | first2 = L.R. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys | url = http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Egan%20Santos%20Bloom%20-%20origins%20cog%20diss%20-%20Psy%20Sci%202007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 11| pages = 978–983 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02012.x| pmid = 17958712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of ''An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes'' (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked [[psychological stress]] when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harmon-Jones|first=E|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=C|last3=Levy|first3=N|date=2015|title=An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes|doi=10.1177/0963721414566449|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=3|pages=184–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude'' (2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of [[Envy]] (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person's [[self-concept]] was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class [[snobbery]]. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and ''Schadenfreude'' (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the [[insular lobe]], and with increased activity in the [[Striatum|striate nucleus]]; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of [[empathy]] (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jankowski|first=K|last2=Takahashi|first2=H|date=2014|title=Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude|journal=Psychiatry &amp; Clinical Neurosciences|volume=68|issue=5|pages=319–336|doi=10.1111/pcn.12182|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260947954_Cognitive_neuroscience_of_social_emotions_and_implications_for_psychopathology_Examining_embarrassment_guilt_envy_and_schadenfreude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling in neural networks ==

'''Conservation psychology''' is the scientific study of the reciprocal relationships between [[human]]s and the rest of [[nature]], with a particular focus on how to encourage [[conservation movement|conservation]] of the [[natural environment|natural world]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, C.D. 2003. The Emerging Field of Conservation Psychology. Human Ecology Review, Vol. 10, No, 2. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a specialty area within [[psychology]] itself, it is a growing field for scientists, researchers, and practitioners of all disciplines to come together and better understand the earth and what can be done to preserve it. This network seeks to understand why humans hurt or help the environment and what can be done to change such behavior. The term "conservation psychology" refers to any fields of psychology that have understandable knowledge about the environment and the effects humans have on the natural world. Conservation psychologists use their abilities in "greening" psychology and make society [[ecologically sustainable]].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ Myers, Gene. ''Conservation Psychology''. WWU. January 20, 2002.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219133545/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of conservation psychology is oriented toward environmental sustainability, which includes concerns like the conservation of [[natural resources|resources]], conservation of [[ecosystem]]s, and quality of life issues for humans and other [[species]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

One common issue is a lack of understanding of the distinction between conservation psychology and the more-established field of [[environmental psychology]], which is the study of transactions between individuals and all their physical settings, including how people change both the built and the natural environments and how those environments change them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, R. 2007. Environmental Psychology: Principles and Practice (4th ed.). Colville, WA: Optimal Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental psychology began in the late 1960s (the first formal program with that name was established at the City University of New York in 1968), and is the term most commonly used around the world. Its definition as including human transactions with both the natural and built environments goes back to its beginnings, as exemplified in these quotes from three 1974 textbooks: "Environmental psychology is the study of the interrelationship between behavior and the built and natural environment"&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.A., Fisher, J. D., &amp; Loomis, R.J.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Philadelphia PA: Saunders (p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt; and "...the natural environment is studied as both a problem area, with respect to [[environmental degradation]], and as a setting for certain recreational and psychological needs",&lt;ref&gt;Ittelson, W.H., Proshansky, H.M., Rivlin, L.G., Winkel, G.H. 1974. Environmental Psychology: An Introduction. New York: Hold, Rinehart, and Winston (p. 6),&lt;/ref&gt; and a third that included a chapter entitled The Natural Environment and Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heimstra, N.W. &amp; McFarling, L.H.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation psychology, proposed more recently in 2003 and mainly identified with a group of US academics with ties to zoos and environmental studies departments, began with a primary focus on the relations between humans and animals. Introduced in ecology, policy, and biology journals, some have suggested that it should be expanded to try to understand why humans feel the need to help or hurt the environment, along with how to promote conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clayton|first=S|author2=Brook, A|title=Can Psychology Save the World?  A Model for Conservation Psychology|journal=[[Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy]] |date=Dec 2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=87–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneers in this field==
Psychologists from all fields including philosophy, biology, sociology, industrial and organizational, health, and consumer psychology, along with many other subfields like environmental education and [[conservation biology]] come together to put their knowledge to practice in educating others to work together and encourage a congruous relationship between humans and the environment around them. These psychologists work together with places such as zoos and aquariums. Zoos and aquariums may seem to only be places of recreation and fun but are actually trying hard to put positive messages out and to educate the public on the homes and needs of the animals that live there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitgood|first=Stephen C.|title=Environmental psychology in museums, zoos, and other exhibition centers|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|location=NJ|isbn=0-471-40594-9|pages=461–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are trying to find ways to interact and teach the public the consequences of their day to day actions to the animals and the environment rather than simply viewing the animals. Psychologists and sociologists have been visiting workshops and think tanks at the zoos to evaluate if the animals are being viewed and shown to the best of their ability while still giving informative knowledge to the public.

==Research to consider==
What characterizes conservation psychology research is that in addition to descriptive and theoretical analyses, studies will explore how to cause the kinds of changes that lessen the impact of human behavior on the natural environment, and that lead to more sustainable and harmonious relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, L.C. &amp; Schultz, P.W. (eds.). 2000. Promoting environmentalism. Journal of Social Issues 56, 3, 365–578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, C.M. 1999. Psychological perspectives on sustainability. In E. Becker and T. Jahn (eds.), Sustainability and the Social Sciences: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Integrating Environmental Considerations into Theoretical Reorientation, 223–42. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research being done with respect to conservation is estimating exactly how much land and water resources are being used by each human at this point along with projected future growth.  Also important to consider is the partitioning of land for this future growth.  Additionally, conservation efforts look at the positive and negative consequences for the biodiversity of plant and animal life after humans have used the land to their advantage.  In addition to creating better conceptual models, more applied research is needed to: 1) identify the most promising strategies for fostering ways of caring about nature, 2) find ways to reframe debates and strategically communicate to the existing values that people have, 3) identify the most promising strategies for shifting the societal discourse about human–nature relationships, and 4) measure the success of these applications with respect to the conservation psychology mission.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; The ultimate success of conservation psychology will be based on whether its research resulted in programs and applications that made a difference with respect to environmental sustainability. We need to be able to measure the effectiveness of the programs in terms of their impact on behavior formation or behavior change, using tools developed by conservation psychologists.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

== Present research and future planning ==
Conservation psychology research has broken down the four most important tenets of promoting positive conservation attitudes into "the four 'I's".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Vugt|first=Mark|title=Averting the Tragedy of the Commons: Using Social Psychological Science to Protect the Environment|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1 June 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=169–173|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01630.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include: Information, Identity, Institutions, and Incentives.  Research has been done in all four categories.

=== Information ===
Studies have shown that the way in which crises are presented is a key predictor for how people will react to them.  When people hear that they personally can help to alleviate a crisis through their conservation efforts, just by simple actions with their personal energy use, they are more likely to conserve.  However, if people are told that the other people around them are overusing energy, it increases selfish behavior and causes people to actually consume more.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"&gt;{{cite journal|last=SAUNDERS|first=CAROL D. |author2=BROOK, AMARA T. |author3=EUGENE MYERS, OLIN|title=Using Psychology to Save Biodiversity and Human Well-Being|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 June 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=702–705|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching people about the benefits of conservation, including easy ways to help conserve, is an effective way to inform about and promote more environmentally friendly behavior.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Patrick R.|author2=Greco, Steven E. |author3=Thorne, James H. |title=Boundaries Make a Difference: The Effects of Spatial and Temporal Parameters on Conservation Planning*|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=24 June 2010|volume=62|issue=3|pages=409–425|doi=10.1080/00330121003788309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, research has shown that making sure people understand more about the boundaries of land they can help preserve actually improves positive attitudes towards conservation.  When people know more about local regions they can help protect, they will care more.  Knowing more about the regions includes knowing the extent of the [[biodiversity]] in that region, and being sure that the ecosystem will remain healthy and protected.  Cost analysis is another important factor.  People do not want to take risks on valuable lands, which in places like California, could be worth billions.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"/&gt;

=== Identity ===
In general, people like to fit in and identify with their peer social groups.  Studies have shown people identify more intimately with close friends and family, which is why conservation campaigns try to directly address the most people.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"/&gt;  The "think of the children" argument for conservation follows this logic by offering a group everyone can relate to and feel close to.  Studies have also shown that this need to fit in among peer social groups can be reinforced positively or negatively: giving positive feedback on energy bills for conserving in their homes encourages people to continue lower energy use.  Examples of negative [[reinforcement]] include the use of negative press against companies infamous for heavy pollution.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

Another interesting line of research looks at how people identify positively or negatively with certain issues.  One relevant idea is the notion of "consistency attitudes".  Studies have shown that people tend to take a good association they have, and then use this to make positive or negative links with other, related things.  For example, if someone thinks it is a good idea to protect old Pacific forests, this will positively form a link to also want to protect smaller forests and even grasslands.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bright|first=Alan D.|author2=Barro, Susan C. |author3=Burtz, Randall T. |title=Attitudes Toward the Protection and Restoration of Natural Areas Across Three Geographic Levels: An Examination of Interattitude Consistency1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=1 November 2001|volume=31|issue=11|pages=2301–2321|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This same line of thinking can cause someone who supports the protection of old Pacific forests to start thinking negatively about the creation of more logging roads.  Other studies on consistency attitudes have shown that, with one particular issue, people like to align their preferences with each other.  This has been shown repeatedly while looking at political ideologies and racial attitudes, and studies have shown that this can also include environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  Finally, other studies have shown that how people identify an ecosystem geographically can affect their concern for it.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  For instance, when people think of saving the rainforests, they often think of this as a global problem and support it more readily.  However, lesser known but still significant local ecosystems remain ignored and unprotected.

=== Institutions ===
Another approach that has been considered is the use of organized institutions and government as the leaders for promoting conservation.  However, these leaders can only be effective if they are trusted.  Studies from previous crises where conserving resources was extremely necessary showed that people were more likely to obey energy restrictions and follow certain leaders when they felt they could trust the people directing them.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  People need to understand that they are being encouraged to act a certain way out of necessity, and that they are not being misled.

=== Incentives ===
Incentivizing conservation through rewards and fines is another approach.  Studies have shown that people who identify more with their community need less incentives to conserve than those who do not identify strongly with their surrounding community.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  For corporations, monetary incentives have been shown to work for companies showing some effort to make their buildings and practices more "green".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  Studies have also shown that doing something as simple as putting a water meter in homes has helped incentivize conservation by letting people track their energy consumption levels.  Finally, studies have shown that when giving fines, it is better to start with very small and then raise it for repeated violations.  If the fines are too high, the issue becomes too economic, and people start to mistrust the authorities enforcing the fines.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

==Main concepts==
Conservation psychology assesses as a whole four different concepts. At the country's first Conservation Psychology conference these four things were discussed. The first is the main original topic of the field, and the other three are topics with a previous history in [[environmental psychology]].

The first topic being discussed is the connection of humans and animals. The Multi-Institutional Research Project (MIRP) works diligently on finding ways to develop a compassionate stance towards animals in the public eye. Many different questions were assessed to find answers to questions concerning ways to help develop loving attitudes for animals and the earth. With these questions and answers, effective educational and interpretive programs were made that would help review the progress.

The second concept that was discussed at the conference concerned connections of humans and places. A new language of conservation will be supported if there are abundant opportunities for meaningful interactions with the natural world in both urban and rural settings. Unfortunately, as biodiversity is lost, every generation has fewer chances to experience nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, P.K., Jr. 1999. The human relationship with nature. Development and culture. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. 2006. Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution: in press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many questions asked concerning how humans in their everyday lives could be persuaded or educated well enough to make them want to join in programs or activities that help maintain biodiversity in their proximity. Local public and private organizations were asked to come together to help find ways to protect and manage local land, plants, and animals. Other discussions came to whether people on an individual or community level would voluntarily choose to become involved in maintaining and protecting their local biodiversity. These plus many other important questions were contemplated. Techniques in marketing are a key tool in helping people connect to their environment. If an identity could be connected from the environment to towns becoming more urbanized, maybe those living there would be more prone to keep it intact.

The third discussion covered the aspects of producing people who act [[environmentally friendly]]. Collectively, any activities that support sustainability, either by reducing harmful behaviors or by adopting helpful ones, can be called conservation behaviors. Achieving more sustainable relationships with nature will basically require that large numbers of people change their reproductive and consumptive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Any action, small or large, that helps the environment in any way is a good beginning to a future of generations who only practice environmentally friendly behavior. This may seem to be a far-fetched idea but with any help at all in educating those who do not know the repercussions of their actions could help achieve this. Approaches to encouraging a change in behavior were thought about carefully. Many do not want to change their way of life. A more simplistic lifestyle rather than their materialistic, current lives hurt their environment around them rather than help, but could people willingly change? To take public transportation rather than drive a car, recycling, turning off lights when they are not needed, all these things are very simple yet a nuisance to actually follow through with. Would restructuring tax-code help people to want to change their attitudes? Any concept to reach the goal of helping people act ecologically aware was discussed and approached. Some empirical evidence shows that simply "being the change you want to see in the world" can influence others to behave in more environmentally friendly ways as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R., &amp; Gifford, R. (2013). Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places. Environment &amp; Behavior, 45, 323-343, DOI: 10.1177/0013916511431274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final point at the first Conservation Psychology convention was the discussion of the values people have to their environment. Understanding our relationship to the natural world well enough so that we have a language to celebrate and defend that relationship is another research area for conservation psychology. According to the [[biophilia hypothesis]], the [[human]] species evolved in the company of other life forms, and we continue to rely physically, emotionally, and intellectually on the quality and richness of our affiliations with natural diversity.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; A healthy and diverse natural environment is considered an essential condition for human lives of satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Kellert, S.R. &amp; Wilson E.O. (eds.). 1993. The Biophilia Hypothesis. Washington, DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Where did they get these values and are they ingrained to the point they cannot be changed? How can environmentally educated people convey value-based communication to a community, a nation, or even on a global level? National policy for this model is something that is desired but under such a strong political scrutiny this could be very challenging. Advocates for biodiversity and different programs came together to try to find methods of changing Americans' values concerning their environment and different methods to express and measure them.

==Connection of conservation in biology and psychology==
[[Conservation biology]] was originally conceptualized as a crisis-oriented discipline, with the goal of providing principles and tools for preserving biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, M.E. (1987). History of the Society for Conservation Biology: How and why we got here. Conservation Biology, 1, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a branch of biology that is concerned with preserving genetic variation in plants and animals. This scientific field evolved to study the complex problems surrounding habitat destruction and species protection. The objectives of conservation biologists are to understand how humans affect biodiversity and to provide potential solutions that benefit both humans and non-human species. It is understood in this field that there are underlying fields of biology that could readily help to have a better understanding and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Biological knowledge alone is not sufficient to solve conservation problems, and the role of the social sciences in solving these problems has become increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;Mascia, M.B.; Brosius, J.P.; Dobson, T.A.; Forbes, B.C.; Horowitz, L.; McKean, M.A. &amp; N.J. Turner. 2003. Conservation and the social sciences. Conservation Biology 17: 649–50.&lt;/ref&gt; With the knowledge of conservation biology combined with other fields, much was thought to be gained. Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human thought, feeling, and behavior.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Psychology was one of the fields that could take its concepts and apply them to conservation. It was also always understood that in the field of psychology there could be much aid to be given, the field only had to be developed. Psychology can help in providing insight into moral reasoning and moral functioning, which lie in the heart of human–nature relationships.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Everyone that is now involved from the field of psychology had knowledge of ways to conceptualize the relationship of humans to their environment. Biology has always been involved in advances of conservation considering biodiversity, and the organisms in it are part of the main field of biology. Psychology has been absent from conservation for some time, but educators and scientists are realizing that with the help of both we can come to a better understanding of humans and their social interactions with their environment and everything in it.

A '''corner solution''' is a special solution to an [[Agent (economics)|agent]]'s [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]] problem in which the quantity of one of the arguments in the maximized function is [[0 (number)|zero]]. In non-technical terms,:3 a corner solution is when the chooser is either unwilling or unable to make a tradeoff.  In economics when someone says "I wouldn't buy that at any price" or "I will do X no matter the cost", those are corner solutions.  Another example is "zero-tolerance" policies, or parents who are unwilling to expose their children to any risk, no matter how small and no matter what the benefits of the activity might be.  "Nothing is more important than my child's safety" is a corner solution in its refusal to admit there might be tradeoffs.  The term "corner solution" is sometimes used by economists in a more colloquial fashion to refer to these sorts of situations.  The word "corner" refers to the fact that if one graphs the maximization problem, the optimal point will occur at the "corner" created by the budget constraint and one axis.

A corner solution is an instance where the "best" solution (i.e. maximizing profit, or utility, or whatever value is sought) is achieved based not on the market-efficient maximization of related quantities, but rather based on brute-force boundary conditions. Such a solution lacks [[mathematical elegance]], and most examples are characterized by externally forced conditions (such as "variables ''x'' and ''y'' cannot be negative") that put the actual [[local extrema]] outside the permitted values.

The more usual solution will lie in the non-zero interior at the point of tangency between the [[objective function]] and the constraint. For example, in [[consumer theory]] the objective function is the [[indifference curve|indifference-curve]] map (the [[utility function]]) of the consumer.  The budget line is the constraint.  In the usual case, constrained utility is maximized on the budget constraint with strictly positive quantities consumed of both goods.  For a corner solution, however, utility is maximized at a point on one axis where the budget constraint intersects the highest attainable indifference curve at zero consumption for one good with all income used for the other good.  Furthermore, a range of lower prices for the good with initial zero consumption may leave quantity demanded unchanged at zero, rather than increasing it as in the more usual case.

Another technical way to state it is that a corner solution is a solution to a minimization or maximization problem where the non-corner solution is infeasible, that is, not in the domain. Instead, the solution is a corner solution on an axis where either ''x'' or ''y'' is equal to zero. For instance, from the example above in economics, if the maximal utility of two goods is achieved when the quantity of goods ''x'' and ''y'' are (−2,&amp;nbsp;5), and the utility is subject to the constraint ''x'' and ''y'' are greater than or equal to 0 (one cannot consume a negative quantity of goods) as is usually the case, then the actual solution to the problem would be a corner solution where ''x'' = 0.

'''European Pathway to Zero Waste''' is an EU demonstration project part funded by [[The LIFE Programme]] (LIFE+), the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and is a partnership between the [[Environment Agency]] and [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP). The project has been set up to investigate practical ways to achieve zero waste to landfill in the South East of England. It will share the results with colleagues both in the UK and in relevant EU Member States. Zero waste in this context is an approach to supporting the sustainable use of resources by business to benefit both the economy and the environment. It concentrates on reducing, re-using, recycling and recovering energy from waste. The project will run to March 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2742">[[Ezra Pound]] distinguished three "kinds of [[poetry]]:" '''melopoeia,''' '''phanopoeia,''' and '''logopoeia'''.

==Melopoeia==
'''Melopoeia''' or '''melopeia''' is when words are "charged" beyond their normal meaning with some musical property which further directs its meaning,&lt;ref name="htr"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pound, Ezra|isbn=978-0-8112-0157-5|title=Literary Essays of Ezra Pound|publisher=New Directions Publishing|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; inducing emotional correlations by sound and rhythm of the speech.

Melopoeia can be "appreciated by a foreigner with a sensitive ear" but does not [[translation|translate]] well, according to Pound.&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt;

==Phanopoeia==
'''Phanopoeia''' or '''phanopeia''' is defined as "a casting of images upon the visual [[imagination]],"&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt; throwing the object (fixed or moving) on to the visual imagination. In the first publication of these three types, Pound refers to phanopoeia as "imagism."

Phanopoeia can be translated without much difficulty, according to Pound.

==Logopoeia==
'''Logopoeia''' or '''logopeia''' is defined by Pound as poetry that uses words for more than just their direct meaning,&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt; stimulating the visual imagination with phanopoeia and inducing emotional correlations with melopoeia.

Pound was said to have coined the word from [[Greece|Greek]] roots in a 1918 review of the "Others" poetry anthology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pound |first=Ezra |date=March 1918 |title=Others |url=http://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1297803957765625.pdf |journal=The Little Review |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=56–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — he defined the term as "the dance of the intellect among words."&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt; Elsewhere he changes intellect to intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' of 20 January 1929, he gave a less opaque definition: poetry which "employs words not only for their direct meaning, but [...] takes count in a special way of habits of usage, of the context we expect to find with the word".&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt;

Logopoeia is the most recent kind of poetry and does not translate well, according to Pound{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, though he also claimed it was abundant in the poetry of [[Sextus Propertius]] (c.50BC-15BC).&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra. [[ABC of Reading]]. George Roudedge Limited, 1934. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual word "logopoeia" was not coined by Pound. The word already existed in classical Greek, as one sees by looking at any version of Liddell and Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Greek-English Lexicon, ninth edition, Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott (Oxford UP, 1940), p. 1057&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11332">The term '''fixed action pattern''' ('''FAP'''), or '''modal action pattern''', is sometimes used in [[ethology]] to denote an [[instinct]]ive behavioral sequence that is relatively invariant within the species and almost inevitably runs to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Campbell, N. A.]]|year=1996|title=Biology|edition=4|chapter=Chapter 50|publisher=Benjamin Cummings, New York|ISBN= 0-8053-1957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed action patterns, or similar behaviour sequences, are produced by a [[biological neural network|neural network]] known as the innate releasing mechanism in response to an external [[sensory system|sensory]] stimulus known as a '''sign stimulus''' or '''releaser'''. A fixed action pattern is one of the few types of behaviors which is thought to be "hard-wired" and [[instinct]]ive.

[[Konrad Lorenz]] was one the key founders of the fixed action pattern definition. He identified six characteristics of fixed action patterns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19670401|title=Studying animal behavior : autobiographies of the founders|date=1989|origyear= 1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Dewsbury, Donald A., 1939-|isbn=0226144100|location=Chicago|oclc=19670401}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That stated fixed action patterns are, stereotyped, complex, species characteristic, released, triggered and, independent of experience&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

==Terminology==
The term "sign stimulus", or "releaser", is used to denote a simple feature of a complex stimulus that can elicit a FAP.  For example, the red belly of a male stickleback elicits a head-down, attack behaviour in other male sticklebacks. This same response can be elicited by artificial models or objects that contain the sign stimulus of red, for example, a red coloured card.

The terms "sign stimulus" and "releaser" are sometimes used interchangeably; however, they have different meanings.  The term "sign stimulus" is used to denote a feature of an animal's environment that elicits a particular response.  The term "releaser" is used for a stimulus that has evolved to facilitate communication between conspecifics (animals of the same species).&lt;ref name="Kenyon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenyon, P.|title=Ethological Experiments|publisher=University of Plymouth|accessdate=August 1, 2014|url=http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year1/psy128ethology_experiments/ethexpt.htm#FAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Male stickleback behaviour===

One example of fixed action patterns is the courtship and aggression behaviour of the male three-spined [[stickleback]] during the mating season, described in a series of studies by [[Niko Tinbergen]].  During spring, male sticklebacks change colour, establish a territory and build a nest. They attack male sticklebacks that enter their territory, but court females and entice them to enter the nest to lay eggs.  Tinbergen used crude models of sticklebacks to investigate which features of male and female sticklebacks elicited attack and courtship behaviour from male sticklebacks. Tinbergen's main findings were that male sticklebacks responded in a relatively invariant way and attacked a model with a red belly, but in contrast, courted a model with a swollen belly.

===Egg-retrieval behaviour===
Another example of a behaviour that has been described as a FAP is the egg-retrieval behavior of the [[graylag goose]], reported in classic studies by Niko Tinbergen and [[Konrad Lorenz]]. Like many ground-nesting birds, if an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] becomes displaced from the nest, the greylag rolls it back to the nest with its beak. The sight of the displaced egg is the sign stimulus and elicits the egg-retrieval behaviour. If the egg is removed from the goose during the performance of egg-rolling, the bird often continues with the behavior, pulling its head back as if an imaginary egg is still being maneuvered by the underside of its beak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUNZv-ByPkU|title=Video of grelag goose performing FAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greylag will also attempt to retrieve other egg-shaped objects, such as a golf ball, door knob, or even a model egg too large to have possibly been laid by the goose itself (i.e. a [[supernormal stimulus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tinbergen, N.|year=1951|title=The Study of Instinct|publisher=Oxford University Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate regurgitating reflex.]]
Other examples include:
*Some [[mating dance]]s, commonly carried out by [[bird]]s, are examples of fixed action patterns. In these cases, the sign [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is typically the presence of the opposite sex.
*[[Kelp gull]] chicks are stimulated by a red spot on the mother's beak to peck at the spot (pictured), which induces regurgitation.
*Some [[moth]]s instantly fold their wings and drop to the ground if they encounter ultrasonic signals such as those produced by [[bat]]s; see [[ultrasound avoidance]].
*[[Mayflies]] drop their eggs when they encounter a certain pattern of light polarization which indicates they are over water.

== Significance ==
[[File:V31-d-Graugans.JPG|right|thumb|The egg-rolling retrieval behavior of a [[greylag goose]] is a widely cited as an example of a fixed action pattern.]]

FAPs, or inflexible behavior patterns, are usually noticeable in animal behavior because FAPs represent the simplest type of behavior in which a particular ''stimulus'' almost always results in an invariable behavioral response. 

FAPs have been said to be "hard-wired" in animals' brains. They are unusual in that they are relatively ''un-influenced'' by the environment, once the behaviour has been elicited. The existence of FAPs is rather unusual in that a fixed response can lead to maladaptive results, whereas flexible behaviors are generally more likely to be adaptive by increasing [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Because of this, most behaviors which are both FAPs and occur in more complex animals are usually essential to the animal's fitness, or in which speed (i.e. an absence of learning) is a factor.  For instance, the greylag goose's egg rolling behavior is so essential to the survival of its chicks that the fitness of the parent bird is increased by the behavior being relatively invariant. A stickleback will attack any male fish who enters his territory while the female is sexually receptive, reacting to their red colour, while the female stickleback triggers behavior in the male resulting in the fertilization of her eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=APARICIO|first=SANS|title=Psychology of Motivation|year=2000|publisher=UNED|location=Spain|isbn=9788492948673}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatively invariant behaviors are also predictable, which can lead to their exploitation by humans or other animals.

There are exceptions to fixed action pattern rules. For example, male blond ring doves isolated from their own species will resort to courting a pigeon, then a human's hand, and finally expressing courtship activity alone in their box if they are left alone for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CRAIG|first=WALLACE|title=APPETITES AND AVERSIONS AS CONSTITUENTS OF INSTINCTS|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2307/1536346|journal=The Biological Bulletin|volume=34|issue=2|pages=91–107|doi=10.2307/1536346|pmc=1091358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aYS5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=craig+1918+courtship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yZoJ1mhEpV&amp;sig=EaRgQoA_Rqw2TSujc9i21BCNLqE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH7qXRpvbYAhXyRt8KHeBgBs0Q6AEIQjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=craig%201918%20courtship&amp;f=false|title=The Foundations of Ethology|last=Lorenz|first=K.|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783709136713|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploitation==
[[File:Reed warbler cuckoo.jpg|thumb|Brood parasites, such as the cuckoo, provide a supernormal stimulus to the parenting species.]]
Some species have evolved to exploit the FAPs of other species by [[mimicry]] of their sign stimuli. Replicating the releaser required to trigger a FAP is known as ''code-breaking''. A well-known example of this is [[brood parasitism]], where one species will lay its eggs in the nest of another species, which will then parent its young. A young [[North American cowbird]], for example, provides a supernormal stimulus to its foster parent, which will cause it to forage rapidly to satisfy the larger bird's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Wickler, W. (1968) ''Mimicry in Plants and Animals.'' World University Library, London.&lt;/ref&gt; A nestling will provide higher levels of stimulus with noisier, more energetic behavior, communicating its urgent need for food. Parents in this situation have to work harder to provide food, otherwise their own offspring are likely to die of [[starvation]].
&lt;!-- Second example: Thynnine wasps and orchids (orchid exploiting wasp) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Third example: Larva of blister beetles emits scents that mimics the scents coming from female Ivy bees so that the male Ivy bees come to mate the larval mass. The larva then climbs on the body of the male bee which later if lucky gets to mate a female bee. Then the larva rides with the female bee to the hive of the bee and exploit the food resources of the hive for its own survival.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, J. (2013)''Animal Behavior.''Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers. Sunderland, Massachusetts &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">''''Good citizenship'''' is when one properly fulfills their role as a [[citizen]]. There are many opinions as to what constitutes a good citizen. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] said, "The first requisite of a good citizen in this Republic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his weight."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt, Speech at New York (1902-11-11)&lt;/ref&gt; Education is sometimes viewed as a prerequisite to good citizenship, in that it helps citizens make good decisions and deal with [[demagogue]]s who would delude them. Roger Soder writes that in a [[democracy]], where the demands of good citizenship are placed upon all, "only the common schools can provide to all the education that all need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Good Citizen and the Common School|author=Roger Soder|journal=Phi Delta Kappan Magazine|volume=85|issue=1|date=2003|page=37|jstor=20440499}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science literacy]] is also frequently touted as a key to good citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=S Lee, WM Roth|journal=Science, Technology &amp; Human Values|year=2003|title=Science and the" good citizen": Community-based scientific literacy|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/3/403|doi=10.1177/0162243903028003003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good citizenship is sometimes viewed as requiring both intellectual skills (such as [[critical thinking]]) and participatory skills (such as deliberating civilly, monitoring the government, building coalitions, managing conflict peacefully and fairly, and petitioning, speaking or testifying before public bodies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40027433|title=Educating Democratic Minds in South African Public Schools: African Teachers' Perceptions of Good Citizenship|author=Sonja Schoeman|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=74|issue=3|date=2005|pages=275–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote that men who serve the state making "no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense...are commonly esteemed good citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Thoreau, Henry David|url=http://thoreau.eserver.org/civil1.html|title=Civil Disobedience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orit Ichilov notes that children "tend to perceive the government in the image of an ideal father that is benevolent and protective. At this stage, the good citizen is characterized as one who, through his behavior, proves himself one worthy of the love and protection of the government rather than one possessing certain political obligations and rights." Through their early school years, children usually continue to think in apolitical terms of their citizenship, expressing loyalty by their desire to remain in their country due to an attachment to its beauty, wildlife, and good people. By age twelve or thirteen, they begin referring more to political qualities, such as the nature and values of the regime. High school seniors define the good citizen primarily in political terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="The Good Citizen" As Viewed by Israeli Adolescents|author=Orit Ichilov and Nisan Nave|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=13|issue=3|date=1981|pages=361–376|jstor=421903|doi=10.2307/421903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students define good citizenship in terms of standing up for what one believes in. [[Joel Westheimer]] identifies the personally responsible citizen (who acts responsibly in his community, e.g. by [[donating blood]]), the participatory citizen (who is an active member of community organizations and/or improvement efforts) and the justice-oriented citizen (who critically assesses social, political, and economic structures to see beyond surface causes) as three different types of "good citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Educating the "Good" Citizen: Political Choices and Pedagogical Goals|author=Joel Westheimer and Joseph Kahne|journal=Political Science and Politics|volume=37|issue=2|year= 2004|pages=241–247|jstor=4488813|doi=10.1017/S1049096504004160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes incentives prevail over desires to be a good citizen. For example, many people will avoid coming forth as witnesses in court cases because they do not want to deal with the inconvenience and [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why the Good Citizen Avoids Testifying|author=A. S. Cutler|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=287|issue=Judicial Administration and the Common Man|date=1953|pages=103–109|jstor=1028908|doi=10.1177/000271625328700116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] makes a distinction between the good citizen and the good man, writing, "...there cannot be a single absolute excellence of the good citizen. But the good man is so called in virtue of a single absolute excellence. It is thus clear that it is possible to be a good citizen without possessing the excellence which is the quality of a good man." Specifically, in his view, the good citizen is measured in relation to ruling and being ruled, the good man only in ruling. Some of the ambiguity is likely due to more than one [[Greek word]] being translated "good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Good Man and the Good Citizen in Aristotle's "Politics"|author=Robert Develin|journal=Phronesis|volume=18|issue=1|year=1973|pages=71–79|jstor=4181903|doi=10.1163/156852873X00069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations attempt to promote "good citizenship." For example, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] published ''[[Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship]]'', and the [[Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship]] is given to those who are deemed to have made outstanding contributions to the well being of their communities without expectation of remuneration or reward. Another non profit organization, [http://goodcitizen.org Good Citizen], has a mission to teach Americans how to be effective citizens and focuses on 100 citizen actions.

[[File:The Green Dot.svg|thumb|200px|The Green Dot symbol]]

The '''Green Dot''' ({{lang-de|'''Der Grüne Punkt'''}}) is the license symbol of a European network of industry-funded systems for recycling the packaging materials of consumer goods. The logo is trademark protected worldwide.

==Concept==
The Green Dot was a system thought up by [[Klaus Töpfer]], Germany's environment minister in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/german-green-dot-recycling-system-under-threat/a-16939098 German Green Dot recycling system] Deutsche Welle 15.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea of the Green Dot is that consumers who see the logo know that the manufacturer of the product contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling. This can be with household waste collected by the authorities (e.g. in special bags - in Germany these are yellow), or in containers in public places such as car parks and outside supermarkets.

The system is financed by the green dot licence fee paid by the producers of the products. Fees vary by country and are based on the material used in packaging (e.g. paper, plastic, metal, wood, cardboard). Each country also has different fees for joining the scheme and ongoing fixed and variable fees. Fees also take into account the cost of collection, sorting and recycling methods.

In simple terms, the system encourages manufacturers to cut down on packaging as this saves them the cost of licence fees.

[[Image:4 PAO 12M 2007-07-12.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Black-and-white version of the "Der Grüne Punkt" DSD logo on a bottle of lotion, located between the [[PAO symbol]] and the [[resin identification code]] for [[LDPE]], next to an [[EAN-13]] barcode.]]

==German dual system of waste collection==
In 1991, the German government passed a packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take care of the recycling or disposal of any packaging material they sell. As a result of this law, German industry set up a "dual system" of [[waste collection]], which picks up household packaging in parallel to the existing municipal waste-collection systems. This industry-funded system is operated in Germany by the Duales System Deutschland GmbH (German for "Dual System Germany Ltd") corporation, or short DSD.

DSD only collects packaging material from manufacturers who pay a license fee to DSD. DSD license fee payers can then add the Green Dot logo to their package labeling to indicate that this package should be placed into the separate yellow bags or yellow [[wheelie bin]]s that will then be collected and emptied by DSD-operated [[waste collection vehicles]] and sorted (and where possible recycled) in DSD facilities.

German licence fees are calculated using the weight of packs, each material type used and the volumes of product produced per.

==Management==
Worldwide stewardship of the Green Dot logo is managed by PRO Europe (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe) on behalf of the various national Green dot organizations across Europe.

==Symbol design and confusion==
The design of the Green Dot symbol has obvious links with the Chinese [[Taijitu]] ([[yin and yang]]) symbol and [[Gary Anderson (Recycling)|Gary Anderson]]'s [[recycling symbol]]. Where full-color printing is available, its official form is printed in a light and a dark shade of green ([[Pantone]] 366C and 343C). For cost reasons or to avoid a visual clash with other symbols, many manufacturers chose a black-and-white or other color combination on their packages.

The Green Dot logo merely indicates that a company has joined the Green Dot scheme, and not necessarily that the package is fully recyclable. The logo is often confused with the [[recycling]] logo.

==Lawsuits==
In Malta, Green Dot Malta Limited, a waste recovery company that is licensed from Der Grune Punkt Duales System Deutschland GmbH to use the Green Dot trademark in Malta, has successfully petitioned the Maltese courts on a number of occasions to protect the mark from free-riders and from competitors seeking to obtain unfair advantage from the international reputation and goodwill that it enjoys.

In February 2009, Smart Supermarket, a well established local supermarket based in [[Birkirkara]], [[Malta]], was ordered by a judge not to sell, manufacture or pack products bearing the trademark Green Dot without the necessary licenses. Green Dot Malta Limited had argued in court that the supermarket was not only blatantly infringing the trademark and contravening the Trademarks Act but was also taking unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation and goodwill without having its authorisation. The First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro, upheld Green Dot Malta Limited's request and issued a warrant of prohibitory injunction. Lawyers Antoine Naudi and Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Following this injunction, the two parties reached an agreement whereby Smart Supermarket entered into a royalty license agreement with Green Dot Malta Limited and registered all its own branded food items such as confectionery and freshly packed products. they agreed to cooperate. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in ensuring that the intellectual property rights relating to the Green Dot mark in Malta will be further protected from any unlawful use by third parties including suppliers of the various goods to the supermarket.

In April 2009, following a similar request for an injunction filed by Green Dot Malta Limited, the company Zamco Caterware Limited declared in open court that it was binding itself not to circulate any products in the market with the Green Dot symbol on their packaging without the required license. The company also declared that it would not be importing any product bearing the Green Dot mark unless the relative royalty contributions have been paid and unless they prove that the imported product will be recycled in terms of applicable environmental legislation.

In September 2009, Karta Converters Limited, a company which produces and distributes articles made of paper, cardboard and plastic, was ordered by the First Hall of the Civil Court not to manufacture, pack, sell or otherwise continue circulating in the local market products bearing the trademark “Green Dot” without the necessary licenses. Presiding Judge Dr. Geoffrey Valencia accepted Green Dot Malta Limited’s assertion that the company was conducting itself as a “free-rider” in the local market and that it was taking an unjust and unfair advantage of Green Dot’s reputation without having its consent. Following this injunction, Karta Converters Limited issued a press release whereby it declared that it would be adopting the internationally recognised Green Dot symbol on its paper, carton and plastic products in accordance with the law. Karta Converters also declared that it would be joining some three hundred other companies participating in GreenPak, a waste recovery scheme operated by Green Dot Malta Limited, for the recycling of its packaging.

Out of court settlements have been reached on a number of occasions with various other Maltese companies to ensure that the international reputation of the mark is safeguarded.

In May 2010, Green Dot Malta Limited won a court case against Green.Mt Ltd, a local competitor which operates another waste recovery scheme in Malta. The latter was incorporated in 2007, a few years after Green Dot Malta Limited’s registration. Green Dot Malta Limited petitioned the Court to declare that the name Green.Mt Ltd amounted to unfair competition in terms of law since the use of the “.” coupled with the words “Green Mt” was intended to cause confusion in the market.

In delivering judgment, Mr. Justice Raymond Pace stated that the two schemes were obviously direct competitors operating in the same field of activity and that the name Green.Mt Ltd was creating confusion in terms of article 32 of Chapter 13 of the Laws of Malta. The court held that the law laid down that businesses could not use any name, mark or symbol which could create confusion with another name, mark or symbol used legally by others. The imitation did not need to be perfect. It was enough that in its entirety it could deceive a consumer. The Judge said that an examination of the words used left him in no doubt that the names could and indeed were creating confusion amongst consumers. The Court thus ordered Green.Mt Ltd to pay Green Dot Malta Limited a nominal sum by way of penalty and to destroy any offending material in its possession bearing the name Green.Mt Ltd within 30 days from date of judgment. Dr. Antoine Naudi and Dr. Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Before final judgment was delivered, Green.Mt Ltd changed its name to Green MT Ltd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25785">[[File:Lorenz emotions.png|right|thumb|250px|A drawing by [[Konrad Lorenz]] showing facial expressions of a dog]]
The '''grimace scale''' ('''GS'''), sometimes called the '''grimace score''', is a method of assessing the occurrence or severity of [[Pain in animals|pain]] experienced by non-human animals according to [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[Blind experiment|blinded]] scoring of facial expressions, as is done routinely for the measurement of pain in non-verbal humans.  Observers score the presence or prominence of “facial action units" (FAU), e.g. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Ear Position and Whisker Change.  These are scored by observing the animal directly in real-time, or post hoc from photographs or [[Frame grabber|screen-grabs]] from videos.  The facial expression of the animals is sometimes referred to as the '''pain face'''.

The GS method of pain assessment is highly applicable to [[laboratory rodent]]s as these are usually prey species which tend to inhibit the expression of pain to prevent appearing vulnerable to predators. For this reason, behavioural changes in these species are mainly observed with acute pain (hours) but are less pronounced in longer-lasting pain (days).&lt;ref name="Faller" /&gt;

For mice at least, the GS has been shown to be a highly accurate, repeatable and reliable means of assessing pain requiring only a short period of training for the observer.&lt;ref name="Miller2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittaker" /&gt;  Across species, GS are proven to have high accuracy and reliability, and are considered useful for indicating both procedural and postoperative pain, and for assessing the efficacy of analgesics.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chambers, C.T.  |author2=Mogil, J.S.|year=2015|title=Ontogeny and phylogeny of facial expression of pain|journal=Pain|volume=156|issue=5|pages=798–799|url= http://download.lww.com/wolterskluwer_vitalstream_com/PermaLink/PAIN/A/PAIN_2015_03_26_CHAMBERS_PAIN-D-14-13333_SDC1.pdf|doi=10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rysewyk"&gt;{{cite journal|author= van Rysewyk, S.|year=2016|title=Nonverbal indicators of pain|journal=Animal Sentience: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Animal Feeling|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30|url= http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=animsent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall accuracy of GS is reported as 97% for mice, 84% for rabbits, 82% for rats and 73.3% for horses.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History==
Facial expressions have long been considered as indicators of emotion in both human and non-human animals.  The biologist, [[Charles Darwin]], considered that non-human animals exhibit similar facial expressions to emotional states as do humans.  The assessment of changes in human anatomy during facial expressions were successfully translated from humans to non-human primates, such as the chimpanzee (ChimpFACS [http://www.chimpfacs.com/])&lt;ref name="Parr2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parr, L.A., Waller, B.M., Vick, S.J. and Bard, K.A.|year=2007|title=Classifying chimpanzee facial expressions using muscle action|journal=Emotion|volume=7|issue=1|pages=172–181|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.1.172|pmid=17352572|pmc=2826116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rhesus macaque (MaqFACS [http://lisaaparr.com/maqfacs.html]),&lt;ref name="Parr2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Parr, L.A., Waller, B.M., Burrows, A.M., Gothard, K.M. and Vick, S.J.|year=2010|title=Brief communication: MaqFACS: A muscle‐based facial movement coding system for the rhesus macaque|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=143|issue=4|pages=625–630|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21401|pmid=20872742|pmc=2988871}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were not originally applied to assess pain in these species.  In 2010, a team of researchers successfully developed&lt;ref name="Langford2010"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Methods|year=2010|volume=7|issue=6|pages=447–449|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1455|title=coding of facial expressions of pain in the laboratory mouse|author=Langford, D.J., Bailey, A.L., Chanda, M.L., Clarke, S.E., Drummond, T.E., Echols, S., Glick, S., Ingrao, J., Klassen-Ross, T., Lacroix-Fralish, M.L., Matsumiya, L., Sorge, R.E., Sotocinal, S.G., Tabaka, J.M., Wong, D., van den Maagdenberg, A.M., Ferrari, M.D., Craig, K.D. and Mogil, J.S.|pmid=20453868}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first method to assess pain using changes in facial expression in any non-human animal species.  Broadly speaking, GS quantify spontaneous pain according to objective and blinded scoring of facial expressions, as is done routinely for the measurement of pain in non-verbal humans.  Observers score the presence and extent of "facial action units" (FAU), e.g. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Ear Position and Whisker Change.  These are scored in real-time by observing the animal directly, or, [[:wikt:post hoc|post hoc]] from photographs or screen-grabs from videos.

This method of pain assessment is highly applicable to prey animals which tend to inhibit the overt expression of pain to prevent appearing vulnerable to predators. For this reason, behavioural changes in these species are mainly observed with acute pain (hours) but are less pronounced in longer-lasting pain (days).&lt;ref name="Faller" /&gt;

GS offer advantages over other methods of pain assessment. For example, the analgesic [[morphine]] reduces pain but can affect other aspects of behaviour in pain-free animals, for example, excitement, increased activity or sedation, which can hamper traditional behavioural assessment of its action on pain.  Morphine not only reduces the frequency of "pain faces" but has no effect on GS in baseline, pain-free mice.&lt;ref name="Flecknell"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Flecknell, P.A.|year=2010|title=Do mice have a pain face?|journal=Nature Methods|volume=7|issue=6|pages=437–438|url=http://www.proppi.uff.br/ceua/sites/default/files/pain_face_flecknell_1.pdf|doi=10.1038/nmeth0610-437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mice==
The GS for mice usually consists of five FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose Bulge, Cheek Bulge, Ear position and Whisker Change.  These are scored on a 0-2 scale where 0=the criterion is absent, 1=moderately present and 2=obviously present (for exemplar images, see here [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3276965/figure/fig1/]).  In mice, the GS offers a means of assessing post-operative pain that is as effective as manual behavioural-based scoring, without the limitations of such approaches.

Facial grimacing by mice after undergoing [[laparotomy]] surgery indicates postoperative pain lasts for 36 to 48 h (and at relatively high levels for 8 to 12 h) with relative exacerbation during the early dark (active) photo-phase.  Furthermore, the grimacing indicates that [[buprenorphine]] is fully efficacious at recommended doses against early postoperative pain, but [[carprofen]] and [[ketoprofen]] are efficacious only at doses much higher than currently recommended: [[acetaminophen]] is not efficacious.&lt;ref name="Matsumiya"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matsumiya, L.C., Sorge, R.E., Sotocinal, S.G., Tabaka, J.M., Wieskopf, J.S., Zaloum, A., ... &amp; Mogil, J.S.|year=2012|title=Using the Mouse Grimace Scale to reevaluate the efficacy of postoperative analgesics in laboratory mice|journal=Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science|volume=51|issue=1|pages=42–9|pmc= 3276965|pmid=22330867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2014 examined postoperative pain in mice following surgical induction of [[myocardial infarction]].  The effectiveness of the GS at identifying pain was compared with a traditional welfare scoring system based on behavioural, clinical and procedure-specific criteria.  It was reported that post hoc GS (but not real-time GS) indicated a significant proportion of the mice were in low-level pain at 24 h which were not identified as such by traditional assessment methods.  Importantly, those mice identified as experiencing low-level pain responded to analgesic treatment, indicating the traditional methods of welfare assessment were insensitive in this aspect of pain recognition.&lt;ref name="Faller"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Faller, K.M., McAndrew, D.J., Schneider, J.E. and Lygate, C.A.|year=2015|title=Refinement of analgesia following thoracotomy and experimental myocardial infarction using the Mouse Grimace Scale|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=100|issue=2|pages=164–172|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2014.083139/pdf|doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2014.083139|pmc=4340041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mice with induced [[sickle cell disease]] and their controls exhibited a "pain face" when tested on a cold plate, but sickle mice showed increased intensity compared to controls; this was confirmed using [[Von Frey hair|Von Frey filaments]] a traditional method of pain assessment.&lt;ref name="Sickle"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mittal, A.M., Lamarre, Y.Y. and Gupta, K.|year=2014|title=Observer based objective pain quantification in sickle mice using grimace scoring and body parameters|journal=Blood|volume=124|issue=21|pages=4907-4907|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/4907.full.pdf?sso-checked=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GS have also been used to assess pain and methods of its alleviation in pancreatitis.&lt;ref name="Pancreatitis"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jurik, A., Ressle, A., Schmid, R.M., Wotjak, C.T. and Thoeringer, C.K.|year=2014|title=Supraspinal TRPV1 modulates the emotional expression of abdominal pain|journal=Pain|volume=155|issue=10|pages=2153–2160|url=http://hcpportalco20150204v2.pfizer.edrupalgardens.com/sites/g/files/g10020151/f/publicaciones/2014_155_10_Supraspinal-TRPV1-modulates-the-emotional.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2014.08.012|pmid=25139591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GS have also been used to test the degree of pain caused as a side-effect of therapeutic drugs and methods of mitigating the pain.&lt;ref name="Melemedjian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Melemedjian, O.K., Khoutorsky, A., Sorge, R.E., Yan, J., Asiedu, M.N., Valdez, A., ... &amp; Price, T.J.|year=2013|title=mTORC1 inhibition induces pain via IRS-1-dependent feedback activation of ERK|journal=Pain|volume=154|issue=7|pages=1080–1091|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2013.03.021|pmc=3742001|pmid=23607966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouse GS has been shown to be a highly accurate, repeatable and reliable means of assessing pain, requiring only a short period of training for the observer.&lt;ref name="Miller2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, A.L.  |author2=Leach, M.C.|year=2015|title=The mouse grimace scale: a clinically useful tool?|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=9|pages=e0136000|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136000|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0136000|pmid=26406227|pmc=4583436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and strain effects===
It has been noted that [[DBA/2]] strain mice, but not CBA strain mice, show an increase in GS score following only [[isoflurane]] anaesthesia, which should be taken into account when using the GS to assess pain.  Administration of a common analgesic, [[buprenorphine]], had no effect on the GS of either strain.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miller, A., Kitson, G., Skalkoyannis, B. and Leach, M.|year=2015|title=The effect of isoflurane anaesthesia and buprenorphine on the mouse grimace scale and behaviour in CBA and DBA/2 mice|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=172|issue=58–62|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159115002415|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.08.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are interactions between the sex and strain of mice in their GS and also the method that is used to collect the data (i.e. real-time or post hoc), which indicates scorers need to consider these factors.&lt;ref name="Miller2015" /&gt;

===Effects of non-painful procedures===
It is important to establish whether methods of pain assessment in laboratory animals are influenced by other factors, especially those which are a normal part of routine procedures or husbandry.  There is no difference in GS scores between mice handled using a tube compared with mice picked up by the tail, indicating these handling techniques are not confounding factors in GS assessment.&lt;ref name="Handling"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, A.L.  |author2=Leach, M.C.|year=2015|title=The effect of handling method on the mouse grimace scale in two strains of laboratory mice|journal=Laboratory Animals|url=http://lan.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/12/10/0023677215622144.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar study reported there was no difference between GS scores at baseline and immediately post [[Earmark (agriculture)|ear notching]] (a method frequently used to identify laboratory mice), potentially indicating that the pain associated with ear notching is either too acute to assess using the GS tool or the practice is not painful.&lt;ref name="Earnotching"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miller, A.L.  |author2=Leach, M.C.|year=2014|title=Using the mouse grimace scale to assess pain associated with routine ear notching and the effect of analgesia in laboratory mice|journal=Laboratory Animals|url= http://lan.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/06/0023677214559084.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rats==
[[File:Rat agouti russian blue.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Closeup of the face of an agouti Russian blue rat]]
There are differences between the "pain face" of mice and rats.  In mice, the nose and cheek at baseline have a smooth appearance, but in the presence of pain, change to distinct bulges in both the nose and cheek regions.  By contrast, in rats at baseline, the nose and cheek regions show distinct bulging, and with pain, the bridge of the nose flattens and elongates causing the whisker pads to flatten.  As a consequence of these differences, the GS for rats sometimes use four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Nose/Cheek Flattening, Ear Changes and Whisker Changes.  Nose/Cheek Flattening, appears to show the highest correlation with the presence of pain in the rat.&lt;ref name="Whittaker"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Whittaker, A.L.  |author2=Howarth, G.S.|year=2014|title=Use of spontaneous behaviour measures to assess pain in laboratory rats and mice: How are we progressing?|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=151|pages=1–12|url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandra_Whittaker/publication/260291380_Use_of_spontaneous_behaviour_measures_to_assess_pain_in_laboratory_rats_and_mice_How_are_we_progressing/links/00b7d5309ca17a87d2000000.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2013.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sotocinal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sotocinal, S.G., Sorge, R E., Zaloum, A., Tuttle, A.H., Martin, L.J., Wieskopf, J.S., ... &amp; McDougall, J.J.|year=2011|title=The Rat Grimace Scale: a partially automated method for quantifying pain in the laboratory rat via facial expressions|journal=Molecular Pain|volume=7|issue=1|pages=55|url= http://www.molecularpain.com/content/pdf/1744-8069-7-55.pdf|doi=10.1186/1744-8069-7-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GS for rats has been used to assess pain due to surgery, [[orthodontic]] tooth movement, and the efficacy of analgesics for these procedures and other painful conditions.&lt;ref name="Sotocinal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chi, H., Kawano, T., Tamura, T., Iwata, H., Takahashi, Y., Eguchi, S., ... &amp; Yokoyama, M.|year=2013|title=Postoperative pain impairs subsequent performance on a spatial memory task via effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in aged rats|journal=Life Sciences|volume=93|issue=25|pages=986–993|doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2013.10.028|pmid=24211778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teeth"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liao, L., Long, H., Zhang, L., Chen, H., Zhou, Y., Ye, N. and Lai, W.|year=2014|title=Evaluation of pain in rats through facial expression following experimental tooth movement|journal=European Journal of Oral Sciences|volume=122|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.1111/eos.12110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Long, H., Liao, L., Gao, M., Ma, W., Zhou, Y., Jian, F., ... &amp; Lai, W.|year=2015|title=Periodontal CGRP contributes to orofacial pain following experimental tooth movement in rats|journal=Neuropeptides|volume=52|pages=31–37|doi=10.1016/j.npep.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Davis, M.E.|year=2014|title=The Effect Of Sumatriptan On Clinically Relevant Behavioral Endpoints In A Recurrent Nitroglycerin Migraine Model In Rats|publisher=The University of Mississippi||url= http://thesis.honors.olemiss.edu/380/1/Morgan%20Davis%20Honors%20College%20Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, GS have been used to examine the effects of postoperative analgesia on the reduction of post-operative [[cognitive dysfunction]] in aged rats.&lt;ref name="Kawano"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kawano, T., Takahashi, T., Iwata, H., Morikawa, A., Imori, S., Waki, S., ... &amp; Yokoyama, M.|year=2014|title=Effects of ketoprofen for prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in aged rats|journal=Journal of Anesthesia|volume=28|issue=6|pages=932–936|doi=10.1007/s00540-014-1821-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with mice, studies have examined the extent of agreement in assessing pain between rat GS and the use of von Frey filaments.  Good agreement has been found between these&lt;ref name="DeRantere2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|url= http://theses.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/11023/1943/2/ucalgary_2014_derantere_debbie.pdf|year=2014|publisher=University of Calgary|author=De Rantere, D.|title=The Evaluation of the Rat Grimace Scale and Ultrasonic Vocalisations as Novel Pain Assessment Tools in Laboratory Rats}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to three models of pain (intra[[plantar]] [[carrageenan]], intraplantar complete [[Freund's adjuvant]] and plantar incision).  The GS score significantly increased in all pain models and the peak GS score also coincided with the development of paw hypersensitivity, although hypersensitivity persisted after GS scores returned to baseline.&lt;ref name="De Rantere2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=De Rantere, D., Schuster, C.J., Reimer, J.N. and Pang, D.S.J.|year=2015|title=The relationship between the Rat Grimace Scale and mechanical hypersensitivity testing in three experimental pain models|journal=European Journal of Pain|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejp.742/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=|doi=10.1002/ejp.742|volume=20|pages=417–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For rats, software (Rodent Face Finder®) has been developed which successfully automates the most labour-intensive step in the process of quantifying the GS, i.e. frame-grabbing individual face-containing frames from digital video, which is hindered by animals not looking directly at the camera or poor images due to motion blurring.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oliver, V., De Rantere, D., Ritchie, R., Chisholm, J., Hecker, K.G. and Pang, D.S.|year=2014|title=Psychometric assessment of the Rat Grimace Scale and development of an analgesic intervention score|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=5|pages=e97882|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0097882|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097882|pmid=24838111|pmc=4024023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rabbits==
A GS for rabbits using four FAU, i.e. Orbital Tightening, Cheek Flattening, Nose Shape, Whisker Position (Ear Position is excluded from the analysis) has been developed (for exemplar images, see here [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044437]) and used to assess the effectiveness of an analgesic cream for rabbits having undergone ear-[[tattoo]]ing.&lt;ref name="Keating"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Keating, S.C., Thomas, A.A., Flecknell, P.A. and Leach, M.C.|year=2012|title=Evaluation of EMLA cream for preventing pain during tattooing of rabbits: changes in physiological, behavioural and facial expression responses|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=9|pages=e44437|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044437|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0044437|pmid=22970216|pmc=3436883}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a GS has been used to evaluate wellness in the post-procedural monitoring of rabbits.&lt;ref name="Hampshire"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hampshire, V.  |author2=Robertson, S.|year=2015|title=Using the facial grimace scale to evaluate rabbit wellness in post-procedural monitoring|journal=Lab Animal|volume=44|issue=7|pages=259–260|doi=10.1038/laban.806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In horses==

Based on the identification of FAU in rodents and rabbits, a GS for horses has been developed from post-operative ([[castration]]) individuals.  This is based on six FAU, i.e. Stiffly Backwards Ears, Orbital Tightening, Tension Above the Eye Area, Prominent Strained Chewing Muscles, Mouth Strained and Pronounced Chin, Strained Nostrils and Flattening of the Profile (for exemplar images, see here.[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092281])&lt;ref name="Dalla"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dalla Costa, E., Minero, M., Lebelt, D., Stucke, D., Canali, E. and Leach, M.C.|year=2014|title=Development of the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) as a pain assessment tool in horses undergoing routine castration|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92281|url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092281|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092281|pmid=24647606|pmc=3960217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HGS has thereafter been used to evaluate pain behavior in the laminitic horse, where it was concluded that the grimace scale can be used to assess the degree of pain also here, when compared to the Obel scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalla Costa|first1=Emanuela|last2=Stucke|first2=Diana|last3=Dai|first3=Francesca|last4=Minero|first4=Michela|last5=Leach|first5=Matthew|last6=Lebelt|first6=Dirk|title=Using the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) to Assess Pain Associated with Acute Laminitis in Horses (Equus caballus)|journal=Animals|date=3 August 2016|volume=6|issue=8|pages=47|doi=10.3390/ani6080047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study&lt;ref name="Gleerup"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gleerup, K.B., Forkman, B., Lindegaard, C. and Andersen, P.H.|year=2015|title=An equine pain face|journal=Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia|volume=42|issue=1|pages=103–114|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/vaa.12212/full|doi=10.1111/vaa.12212}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the equine “pain face” after pain induction by a tourniquet on the antebrachium or topical capsaicin. The pain face here involves similar facial expressions described for the HGS; low and/or asymmetrical ears, an angled appearance of the eyes, a withdrawn and/or tense stare, medio-laterally dilated nostrils and tension of the lips, chin and certain mimetic muscles and can potentially be incorporated to improve existing pain evaluation tools. From the described pain face, The Equine Pain Scale has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gleerup|first1=K. B.|last2=Lindegaard|first2=C.|title=Recognition and quantification of pain in horses: A tutorial review|journal=Equine Veterinary Education|date=January 2016|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47–57|doi=10.1111/eve.12383}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another pain scale has been described (EQUUS-FAP) which also has proven to assess acute pain in horses in a significant way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Loon|first1=Johannes P.A.M.|last2=Van Dierendonck|first2=Machteld C.|title=Monitoring equine head-related pain with the Equine Utrecht University scale for facial assessment of pain (EQUUS-FAP)|journal=The Veterinary Journal|date=February 2017|volume=220|pages=88–90|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2017.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To map and explain the different facial expressions seen in the equine face during acute pain, an equine facial action coding system (EquiFACS) has been developed. Seventeen FAU have been identified and the involved anatomical structures behind each facial expression are explained and compared to facial expressions seen in other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wathan|first1=Jen|last2=Burrows|first2=Anne M.|last3=Waller|first3=Bridget M.|last4=McComb|first4=Karen|last5=Hillmann|first5=Edna|title=EquiFACS: The Equine Facial Action Coding System|journal=PLOS ONE|date=5 August 2015|volume=10|issue=8|pages=e0131738|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cats==
Observers shown facial images from painful and pain-free cats had difficulty in identifying pain-free from painful cats, with only 13% of observers being able to discriminate more than 80% of painful cats.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holden, E., Calvo, G., Collins, M., Bell, A., Reid, J., Scott, E.M. and Nolan, A.M.|year=2014|title=Evaluation of facial expression in acute pain in cats|journal=Journal of Small Animal Practice|volume=55|issue=12|pages=615–621|doi=10.1111/jsap.12283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sheep==
A GS for sheep has been developed to detect pain caused by naturally occurring diseases such as [[footrot]] and [[mastitis]].&lt;ref name="McLennan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McLennan, K.M., Rebelo, C.J., Corke, M.J., Holmes, M.A., Leach, M.C. and Constantino-Casas, F.|year=2016|title=Development of a facial expression scale using footrot and mastitis as models of pain in sheep|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2016.01.007|volume=176|pages=19–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A GS has been used to assess pain due to the routine husbandry procedure of [[Docking (animal)|tail-docking]] in lambs.  There was high reliability between and within the observers, and high accuracy.  Restraint of the lambs during the tail-docking caused changes in facial expression, which needs to be taken into account in use of the GS.&lt;ref name="RSPCA"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Guesgen, M.  |author2=Leach, M.|title=Assessing pain using the lamb grimace scale (LGS)|url=http://norecopa.no/files/RSPCA-AHVLA2013.pdf|year=2014|accessdate=January 11, 2015|publisher=RSPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eschatology}}
'''Hindu eschatology''' is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], or the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] names of the [[Supreme Being]] in Hinduism and before the age draws to a close, and [[Harihara]] simultaneously dissolves and regenerates the universe.

The current period is [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four ''Yuga'' that make up the current age. Each period has seen a progressive decline in morality, to the point that in Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or "[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]". Each kalpa lasts 8.64 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of [[Brahma|birth]], [[Vishnu|growth]], [[Shiva|decay]], and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by the vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavism. Some Shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] and then again will expand from that single point, as the [[yuga|ages]] continue in a religious [[fractal]] pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;{{cite book|last = Hooper| first= Rev.

==The Four Yugas==
Within the current ''kalpa'', there are four ''yugas'', or epochs, that encompass the evolution of this specific cycle. These ages encompass a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total decay.

* [[Satya Yuga]] lasts 1.728 million years.
* [[Treta Yuga]] lasts 1.296 million years.
* [[Dvapara Yuga]] lasts 864,000 years.
* [[Kali Yuga]] lasts 432,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/yugatime.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223140604/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/yugatime.html |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kali Yuga===
[[Kali Yuga]], the last of the four ages, is the one in which we currently reside. This epoch has been foretold to be characterized by impiety, violence, and decay. As written in the [[Puranas|Vishnu Purana]] in 100 BCE:

{{quote|Social status depends not upon your accomplishments, but in the ownership of property; wealth is now the source of virtue; passion and luxury are the sole bonds between spouses; falsity and lying are the conditions of success in life; sexuality is the sole source of human enjoyment; religion, a superficial and empty ritual, is confused with spirituality|Vishnu Purana&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

The fourth age is ruled over by [[Kali (demon)|Kali]], not the goddess [[Kali]] but the [[Kali (demon)|demon Kali]].&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Puranas go on to write that kings in the fourth age will be godless, wanting in tranquility, quick to anger, and dishonest. They will inflict death on women, and children, and will rise and fall to power quickly. Undisciplined barbarians will receive the support of rulers.

From the four pillars of [[dharma]]—penance, charity, truthfulness, and compassion—charity will be all that remains, although it too will decrease daily. People will commit sin in mind, speech and action. Plague, famine, pestilence and natural calamities will appear. People will not believe one another, falsehoods will win disputes and brothers will become avaricious. As the each age progresses, the human life span decreases, starting from thousands of years in the Krutha Yuga to 100 years in the current Kali Yuga.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Sannyasins will wear red. There will be many false religions, and many will profess false knowledge to earn their livelihood. Life will be short and miserable. Marriage will be for pleasure alone. Being dry of water will be the only definition of land, and any hard to reach water will define a pilgrimage destination. People will hide in valleys between mountains, and suffering from cold and exposure, people will wear clothes of tree bark and leaves. People will live less than twenty-three years and the pretense of greatness will be the proof of it. Ultimately, humankind will be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

==Kalki==
{{Main|Kalki}}
[[File:Kalki.jpg|thumb|left|Kalki leading his white horse]]At this time of evil, the final incarnation of Vishnu known as [[Kalki]] will appear on a white horse. He will amass an army of those few pious souls remaining. These, together with all the incarnations of the Godhead (avatars) which have appeared throughout human history, will destroy all demons and sins in the world.

As written in the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;:Yadaa Yadaa hi Dharmasya Glaanir bhavati Bhaarata
:Abhyuthaanam Adharmasya Tadaatmaanam Srjaamy Aham.

:Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha
:And a rise of unrighteousness then I manifest Myself!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m06/m06025.htm |title=The Mahabharata, Book 6, Bhagavad Gita Chapter IV, Section 7|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate = 12 Nov 2012|date = 12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Aditi is the mother of the eight Adityas or solar deities. At the end of creation these eight suns will shine together in the skies. Kalki will amass an army to "establish righteousness upon the earth" and leave "the minds of the people as pure as crystal." Those left, transformed by virtue, will be the new seeds for a higher form of humanity, and humanity will begin again.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Puranas write: {{quote|When the sun and moon, the lunar constellation Tishya, and the planet Jupiter are all in one mansion, the Krita age shall return to the earth.|Hooper, 1508&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

At the completion of [[Kali Yuga]], the next epoch will begin, [[Satya Yuga]], in which everyone will be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma and piety. This, in turn, will be followed cyclically by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will repeat till the larger cycle of existence under [[Brahma]] returns to the singularity and a new universe is born.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last = Browne | first = Sylvia | authorlink = | title = End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World| publisher = | date = | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bAAOiMl1BIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[social psychology]], '''illusory superiority''' is a condition of [[cognitive bias]] whereby a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities, in relation to the same qualities and abilities of other persons. Illusory superiority is one of many [[positive illusions]], relating to the [[self]], that are evident in the study of [[intelligence]], the effective performance of tasks and tests, and the possession of desirable personal characteristics and personality traits.

The term ''illusory superiority'' first was used by the researchers Van Yperen and Buunk, in 1991. The condition is also known as the '''Above-average effect''', the '''superiority bias''', the '''leniency error''', the '''sense of relative superiority''', the '''''primus inter pares'' effect''',
&lt;ref name="hoorens"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hoorens |first=Vera |title=Self-enhancement and Superiority Biases in Social Comparison |journal= European Review of Social Psychology |publisher= Psychology Press |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=113–139 |doi=10.1080/14792779343000040 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''[[Lake Wobegon#The Lake Wobegon effect|Lake Wobegon effect]]'''.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Steven Pinker]] | year=2011 |title= [[The Better Angels of Our Nature]] |location= |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Effects in different situations ==
Illusory superiority has been found in individuals' comparisons of themselves with others in a variety of aspects of life, including performance in academic circumstances (such as class performance, exams and overall intelligence), in working environments (for example in [[job performance]]), and in social settings (for example in estimating one's [[popularity]], or the extent to which one possesses desirable personality traits, such as [[honesty]] or [[confidence]]), and in everyday abilities requiring particular skill.&lt;ref name="hoorens" /&gt;

For ''illusory'' superiority to be demonstrated by social comparison, two logical hurdles have to be overcome. One is the ambiguity of the word "average". It is logically possible for nearly all of the set to be above the [[mean]] if the distribution of abilities is highly [[skewed]]. For example, the mean number of legs per human being is slightly lower than two because some people have fewer than two and almost none have more. Hence experiments usually compare subjects to the [[median]] of the peer group, since by definition it is impossible for a majority to exceed the median.

A further problem in inferring inconsistency is that subjects might interpret the question in different ways, so it is logically possible that a majority of them are, for example, more generous than the rest of the group each on "their own understanding" of generosity.&lt;ref name="Colvin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1= C. Randall Colvin |author2=Jack Block |author3=David C. Funder  |year=1995 |title= Overly Positive Self-Evaluations and Personality: Negative Implications for Mental Health |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=1152–1162 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.6.1152 |pmid=7608859}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is confirmed by [[Experimental psychology|experiments]] which varied the amount of interpretive freedom. As subjects evaluated themselves on a specific, well-defined attribute, illusory superiority remains.&lt;ref name="dunning_meyerowitz"&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =David Dunning |author2= Judith A. Meyerowitz |author3=Amy D. Holzberg  |year=1989 |title= Ambiguity and Self-Evaluation: The Role of Idiosyncratic Trait Definitions in Self-Serving Assessments of Ability |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=1082–1090 |issn=1939-1315 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive ability ===

==== IQ ====
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Downing effect]] --&gt;
One of the main effects of illusory superiority in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] is the "Downing effect". This describes the tendency of people with a below-average IQ to overestimate their IQ, and of people with an above-average IQ to underestimate their IQ. This tendency was first observed by C.&amp;nbsp;L. Downing, who conducted the first [[cross-cultural studies]] on perceived intelligence. His studies also showed that the ability to accurately estimate other people's IQs was proportional to one's own IQ (i.e., the lower the IQ, the less capable of accurately appraising other people's IQs). People with high IQs are better overall at appraising other people's IQs, but when asked about the IQs of people with similar IQs as themselves, they are likely to rate them as having higher IQs.

The disparity between actual IQ and perceived IQ has also been noted between genders by British psychologist [[Adrian Furnham]], in whose work there was a suggestion that, on average, men are more likely to overestimate their intelligence by 5 points, while women are more likely to underestimate their IQ by a similar margin.&lt;ref&gt;Janet E. Davidson and C. L. Downing, [https://books.google.com/?id=7ry1NpFtZKkC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=Contemporary%20models%20of%20intelligence "Contemporary Models of Intelligence"] in Robert J. Sternberg, ''Handbook of Intelligence'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= [[Adrian Furnham]]| author2= Joanna Moutafi| author3 = Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic |title=Personality and Intelligence: Gender, the Big Five, Self-Estimated and Psychometric Intelligence|journal =International Journal of Selection and Assessment|  date= March 2005| volume=13| issue=1|pages=11–24 |doi=10.1111/j.0965-075X.2005.00296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory ====
Illusory superiority has been found in studies comparing [[memory]] self-reports, such as Schmidt, Berg &amp; Deelman's research in older adults. This study involved participants aged between 46 and 89 years of age comparing their own memory to that of peers of the same age group, 25-year-olds and their own memory at age 25. This research showed that participants exhibited illusory superiority when comparing themselves to both peers and younger adults, however the researchers asserted that these judgments were only slightly related to age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iris W. Schmidt |author2=Ina J. Berg |author3=Betto G. Deelman |year= 1999 |title = Illusory Superiority in Self-Reported Memory of Older Adults |journal= Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition  |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=288–301 |doi= 10.1076/1382-5585(199912)06:04;1-B;FT288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive tasks ====
{{Main|Dunning–Kruger effect}}
In Kruger and Dunning's experiments participants were given specific tasks (such as solving [[logic problem]]s, analyzing [[grammar]] questions, and determining whether jokes were funny), and were asked to evaluate their performance on these tasks relative to the rest of the group, enabling a direct comparison of their actual and perceived performance.&lt;ref name="unskilled" /&gt;

Results were divided into four groups depending on actual performance and it was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large illusory superiority bias. The researchers attributed this to the fact that the individuals who were worst at performing the tasks were also worst at recognizing skill in those tasks. This was supported by the fact that, given training, the worst subjects improved their estimate of their rank as well as getting better at the tasks.&lt;ref name="unskilled"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments |first= Justin |last= Kruger |author2 =David Dunning |journal =[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=1121–34 |year=1999 |pmid=10626367 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, titled "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments", won an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 |title= The 2000 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |publisher= Improbable Research |access-date= 27 May 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110225074430/http://improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 |archivedate= 25 February 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Dunning and Joyce Ehrlinger, also of [[Cornell University]], published a study that detailed a shift in people's views of themselves influenced by external cues. Cornell undergraduates were given tests of their knowledge of geography, some intended to positively affect their self-views, others intended to affect them negatively. They were then asked to rate their performance, and those given the positive tests reported significantly better performance than those given the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Joyce Ehrlinger |author2= David Dunning |date= January 2003 |title =How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=5–17 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |doi =10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.5 |pmid=12518967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Ames and Lara Kammrath extended this work to sensitivity to others, and the subjects' perception of how sensitive they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability |journal = Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher= Springer Netherlands |author1 = Daniel R. Ames |author2=Lara K. Kammrath |volume=28 |issue=3 |date= September 2004 |doi=10.1023/B:JONB.0000039649.20015.0e |pages=187–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Burson, Larrick, and Klayman suggests that the effect is not so obvious and may be due to [[Statistical noise|noise]] and bias levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal =Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2006 |volume =90 |issue= 1 |pages= 60–77 |url = http://www.chicagocdr.org/cdrpubs/pdf_index/cdr_560.pdf |title=Skilled or Unskilled, but Still Unaware of It: How Perceptions of Difficulty Drive Miscalibration in Relative Comparisons |author1 = Katherine A.

Dunning, Kruger, and coauthors' latest paper on this subject comes to qualitatively similar conclusions after making some attempt to test alternative explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Why the Unskilled Are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-Insight Among the Incompetent |journal= Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=105 |year=2008 |pages=98–121 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.05.002 |first=Joyce |last=Ehrlinger |first2 =Kerri |last2=Johnson |first3=Matthew |last3=Banner |first4=David |last4=Dunning |first5=Justin |last5=Kruger |pmid=19568317 |pmc=2702783 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Academic ability and job performance ====
In a survey of faculty at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], 68% rated themselves in the top 25% for teaching ability, and more than 90% rated themselves as above average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[K. Patricia Cross]] |year= Spring 1977 |title= Not Can But Will College Teachers Be Improved? |journal =New Directions for Higher Education |volume=1977 | issue = 17 |pages=1–15 |doi =10.1002/he.36919771703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar survey, 87% of [[Master of Business Administration]] students at [[Stanford University]] rated their academic performance as above the median.&lt;ref&gt;"It's Academic." 2000. ''Stanford GSB Reporter'', 24 April, pp.14–5. via {{Cite journal |author= Zuckerman |first= Ezra W. |author2 = John T. Jost |year=2001 |title= What Makes You Think You're So Popular?

Illusory superiority has also explained phenomena such as the large amount of [[stock market]] trading (as each [[Stock trader|trader]] thinks they are the best, and most likely to succeed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/0022-1082.00078 | author1 =[[Terrance Odean]] |date=December 1998  | title = Volume, Volatility, Price, and Profit When All Traders Are Above Average | url = http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/vvpp.pdf | journal = [[Journal of Finance]] | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 1887–1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of lawsuits that go to trial (because, due to illusory superiority, many lawyers have an inflated belief that they will win a case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neale | first1 = Margaret A. | last2 = Bazerman | first2 = Max H. | year = 1985 | title = The Effects of Framing and Negotiator Overconfidence on Bargaining Behaviors and Outcomes | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 34–49 | doi=10.2307/256060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self, friends, and peers ===
One of the first studies that found illusory superiority was carried out in the [[United States]] by the [[College Board]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun"&gt;{{cite book |author1 =Mark D. Alicke |author2 = Olesya Govorun |title= The Self in Social Judgment |editor= Mark D. Alicke |editor2=David A. Dunning |editor3=Joachim I.

In ratings of [[leadership]], 70% of the students put themselves above the median. In ability to get on well with others, 85% put themselves above the median; 25% rated themselves in the top 1%.

A 2002 study on illusory superiority in social settings, with participants comparing themselves to friends and other peers on positive characteristics (such as punctuality and sensitivity) and negative characteristics (such as [[naivety]] or inconsistency). This study found that participants rated themselves more favorably than their friends, but rated their friends more favorably than other peers (but there were several moderating factors).&lt;ref name="suls_lemos_stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Jerry Suls |author2 = Katherine Lemos |author3 = H.&amp;nbsp;Lockett Stewart |year= 2002 |title=Self-Esteem, Construal, and Comparisons With the Self, Friends, and Peers | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher =American Psychological Association |volume=82 |pages=252–261 |doi =10.1037/0022-3514.82.2.252 |url = http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/82_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_252_(Suls).pdf |pmid=11831414 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Perloff and Fetzer,&lt;ref name="Perloff 1986 502–510"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1986 |title= Self–Other Judgments and Perceived Vulnerability to Victimization |journal =Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=50 |pages=502–510 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.3.502 |issue=3|last1= Perloff |first1= Linda S. |last2= Fetzer |first2= Barbara K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown,&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/soco.1986.4.4.353 |last=Brown |first =Jonathan D. |year=1986 |title = Evaluations of Self and Others: Self-Enhancement Biases in Social Judgments  |journal= Social Cognition |volume =4 |issue=4 |pages=353–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John C.

Tajfel and Turner attributed this to an "[[In-group favoritism|ingroup bias]]" and suggested that this was motivated by the individual's desire for a "[[Social identity theory|positive social identity]]".

==== Popularity ====
In Zuckerman and Jost's study, participants were given detailed questionnaires about their [[friendship]]s and asked to assess their own [[popularity]]. Using [[social network analysis]], they were able to show that participants generally had exaggerated perceptions of their own popularity, especially in comparison to their own friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Zuckerman, Ezra W. |author2=John T. Jost |year =2001 |title=What Makes You Think You're So Popular? Self Evaluation Maintenance and the Subjective Side of the 'Friendship Paradox' | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=207–223 |url= http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Zuckerman%20&amp;%20Jost%20(2001)%20What%20Makes%20You%20Think%20You're%20So%20Popular1.pdf |doi=10.2307/3090112 |access-date=29 August 2009 |jstor=3090112 |publisher =American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that most people in the study believed that they had more friends than their friends, a 1991 study by sociologist Scott L. Feld on the [[friendship paradox]] shows that on average, due to [[sampling bias]], most people have fewer friends than their friends have.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = Scott L. |last = Feld |year = 1991 |title = Why your friends have more friends than you do |journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume = 96 |issue = 6 |pages = 1464–1477 |jstor = 2781907 |doi = 10.1086/229693 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationship happiness ====
Researchers have also found illusory superiority in relationship satisfaction. For example, one study found that participants perceived their own relationships as better than others' relationships on average, but thought that the majority of people were happy with their relationships. It also found evidence that the higher the participants rated their own relationship happiness, the more superior they believed their relationship was—illusory superiority also increased their own relationship satisfaction. This effect was pronounced in men, whose satisfaction was especially related to the perception that one's own relationship was superior as well as to the assumption that few others were unhappy in their relationships. On the other hand, women's satisfaction was particularly related to the assumption that most people were happy with their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buunk |first= Bram P. |date=December 2001 |title=Perceived Superiority of One's Own Relationship and Perceived Prevalence of Happy and Unhappy Relationships |journal = British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages= 565–574 |doi= 10.1348/014466601164984}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} found that participants became [[Defence mechanisms|defensive]] when their spouse or partner were perceived by others to be more successful in any aspect of their life, and had the tendency to exaggerate their success and understate their spouse or partner's success.

=== Health ===
Illusory superiority was found in a [[self-report study]] of [[health]] behaviors (Hoorens &amp; Harris, 1998) that asked participants to estimate how often they and their peers carried out healthy and unhealthy behaviors. Participants reported that they carried out healthy behaviors more often than the average peer, and unhealthy behaviors less often. The findings held even for expected future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08870449808407303|year=1998 |title=Distortions in Reports of Health Behaviours: The Time Span Effect and Illusory Superiority | journal = Psychology and Health |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=451–466|last1=Hoorens |first1=Vera |last2=Harris |first2=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Driving ability ===
Svenson (1981) surveyed 161 students in [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]], asking them to compare their [[Driving#Driving skills|driving skills]] and [[Road traffic safety|safety]] to other people. For driving skills, 93% of the U.S. sample and 69% of the Swedish sample put themselves in the top 50%; for safety, 88% of the U.S. and 77% of the Swedish put themselves in the top 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Svenson |first= Ola | url = http://heatherlench.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/svenson.pdf |title= Are We All Less Risky and More Skillful Than Our Fellow Drivers? |journal= Acta Psychologica |volume=47 |issue=2 |date=February 1981 |pages=143–148 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(81)90005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCormick, Walkey and Green (1986) found similar results in their study, asking 178 participants to evaluate their position on eight different dimensions of driving skills (examples include the "dangerous–safe" dimension and the "considerate–inconsiderate" dimension). Only a small minority rated themselves as below the median, and when all eight dimensions were considered together it was found that almost 80% of participants had evaluated themselves as being an above-average driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Iain A.

One commercial survey showed that 36% of drivers believed they were an above-average [[Mobile phones and driving safety|driver while texting]] or sending emails compared to other drivers; 44% considered themselves average, and 18% below average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cheapcarinsurance.net/24-of-drivers-admit-to-coming-close-to-causing-an-accident-while-texting&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immunity to bias ===
{{Main|Bias blind spot}}
Subjects describe themselves in positive terms compared to other people, and this includes describing themselves as less susceptible to bias than other people. This effect is called the "[[bias blind spot]]" and has been demonstrated independently.

== Cultural differences ==
A vast majority of the literature on illusory superiority originates from studies on participants in the [[United States]]. However, research that only investigates the effects in one specific population is severely limited as this may not be a true representation of human psychology. More recent research investigating [[self-esteem]] in other countries suggests that illusory superiority depends on culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= In Search of East Asian Self-Enhancement |journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review |year=2007|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–27|doi=10.1177/1088868306294587 |pmid=18453453|author1 = Heine|first1 = S. J.|last2 = Hamamura|first2 = T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies indicate that [[East Asian]]s tend to underestimate their own abilities in order to improve themselves and get along with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= DeAngelis |first=Tori |title=Why We Overestimate Our Competence |work =Monitor on Psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |date=Feb 2003 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=60 |doi= 10.1037/e300052003-031|access-date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = Carl F. | last2 = Heine | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Yuki | first3 = Masaki | last4 = Takemura | first4 = Kosuke | year = 2009 | title = Why Do Westerners Self-Enhance More than East Asians? | url = http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~heine/docs/WhyWesternersSelfEnhance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 183–203 | doi = 10.1002/per.715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-esteem ==
{{Main|Self-esteem}}
Illusory superiority's relationship with self-esteem is uncertain. The theory that those with high self-esteem maintain this high level by rating themselves highly is not without merit—studies involving non-[[Depression (mood)|depressed]] college students found that they thought they had more control over positive outcomes compared to their peers, even when controlling for performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = David J. | last2 = Abramson | first2 = Lyn Y. | last3 = Alloy | first3 = Lauren B. |date=January 1984 | title =Illusion of Control for Self and Others in Depressed and Non-Depressed College Students | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue =1 | pages = 126–136 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.1.125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-depressed students also actively rate peers below themselves as opposed to rating themselves higher. Students were able to recall a great deal more negative personality traits about others than about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1521/soco.1982.1.3.223 | last1 = Kuiper | first1 = Nicholas A. | last2 = Macdonald | first2 = M. R. | year = 1982 | title = Self and Other Perception in Mild Depressives | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 223–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted though, that in these studies there was no distinction made between people with legitimate and illegitimate high self-esteem, as other studies have found that absence of [[positive illusions]]  mainly coexist with high self-esteem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0191-8869(92)90177-Q | last1 = Compton | first1 = William C. | year = 1992 | title =Are Positive Illusions Necessary for Self-Esteem: A Research Note | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 13 | issue = 12| pages = 1343–1344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Grit (personality trait)|determined]] individuals bent on growth and learning are less prone to these illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knee | first1 = C. Raymond | last2 = Zuckerman | first2 = Miron |date=June 1998 | title = A Nondefensive Personality: Autonomy and Control as Moderators of Defensive Coping and Self-Handicapping  | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 115–130 | doi = 10.1006/jrpe.1997.2207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it may be that while illusory superiority is associated with undeserved high self-esteem, people with legitimate high self-esteem do not necessarily exhibit it.

== Relation to mental health ==
{{Main|Depressive realism}}
[[Psychology]] has traditionally assumed that generally accurate self-perceptions are essential to good [[mental health]]. This was challenged by a 1988 paper by Taylor and Brown, who argued that mentally healthy individuals typically manifest three cognitive illusions—illusory superiority, [[illusion of control]], and [[optimism bias]].&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt; This idea rapidly became very influential, with some authorities concluding that it would be therapeutic to deliberately induce these biases.&lt;ref name="shedler" /&gt; Since then, further research has both undermined that conclusion and offered new evidence associating illusory superiority with negative effects on the individual.&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt;

One line of argument was that in the Taylor and Brown paper, the classification of people as mentally healthy or unhealthy was based on self-reports rather than objective criteria.&lt;ref name="shedler" /&gt; Hence it was not surprising that people prone to [[self-enhancement]] would exaggerate how well-adjusted they are. One study claimed that "mentally normal" groups were contaminated by "defensive deniers", who are the most subject to positive illusions.&lt;ref name="shedler"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shedler |first=Jonathan |author2=Martin Mayman |author3=Melvin Manis  |year=1993 |title=The 'Illusion' of Mental Health |journal= American Psychologist |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume=48 |issue=11 |pages=1117–1131 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.48.11.1117 |pmid=8259825}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[longitudinal study]] found that self-enhancement biases were associated with poor [[social skill]]s and psychological maladjustment.&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt; In a separate experiment where videotaped conversations between men and women were rated by independent observers, self-enhancing individuals were more likely to show socially problematic behaviors such as hostility or irritability.&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt; A 2007 study found that self-enhancement biases were associated with psychological benefits (such as subjective well-being) but also inter- and intra-personal costs (such as [[anti-social behavior]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sedikides |first= Constantine | author2 =Robert S.

== Neuroimaging ==
The degree to which people view themselves as more desirable than the average person links to reduced activation in their [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. This is suggested to link to the role of these areas in processing "cognitive control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beer |first1=Jennifer S. |last2=Hughes |first2=Brent L. |year=2010 |title=Neural systems of social comparison and the "above-average" effect |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/BeerLAB/beerhughesaboveaverage.pdf |journal=NeuroImage |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=2671–2679 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.075 |pmid=19883771 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314235213/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/BeerLAB/beerhughesaboveaverage.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== Noisy mental information processing ===
A 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' suggests that illusory superiority (as well as other biases) can be explained by a simple [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | year = 2012 | title = Toward a Synthesis of Cognitive Biases: How Noisy Information Processing Can Bias Human Decision Making | url = http://martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 138 | issue = 2| pages = 211–237 | doi = 10.1037/a0025940 | pmid = 22122235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggests that the underlying cognitive mechanism is essentially similar to the noisy mixing of memories that can cause the [[conservatism bias]] or [[overconfidence]]: after our own performance, we readjust our estimates of our own performance more than we readjust our estimates of others' performances. This implies that our estimates of the scores of others are even more conservative (more influenced by the previous expectation) than our estimates of our own performance (more influenced by the new evidence received after giving the test). The difference in the conservative bias of both estimates (conservative estimate of our own performance, and even more conservative estimate of the performance of others) is enough to create illusory superiority. Since mental noise is a sufficient explanation that is much simpler and straightforward than any other explanation involving [[heuristics]], behavior, or social interaction,&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; [[Occam's razor]] would argue in its favor as the underlying generative mechanism (it is the hypothesis which makes the fewest assumptions).

=== Selective recruitment ===
Selective recruitment is the notion that, when making peer comparisons, an individual selects their own strengths and the other's weaknesses in order that they appear better on the whole. This theory was first tested by Weinstein (1980); however, this was in an experiment relating to [[optimism bias|optimistic bias]], rather than the better-than-average effect. The study involved participants rating certain behaviors as likely to increase or decrease the chance of a series of life events happening to them. It was found that individuals showed less optimistic bias when they were allowed to see others' answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Weinstein |first= Neil D. |year=1980 |title= Unrealistic Optimism About Future Life Events |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher =American Psychological Association |volume=39  | url = http://heatherlench.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/weinstein.pdf |pages= 806–820 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806 |issue =5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perloff and Fetzer (1986) suggested that when making peer comparisons on a specific characteristic, an individual chooses a comparison target—the peer to whom he is being compared—with lower abilities. To test this theory, Perloff and Fetzer asked participants to compare themselves to specific comparison targets like a close friend, and found that illusory superiority decreased when they were told to envision a specific person rather than vague constructs like "the average peer". However these results are not completely reliable and could be affected by the fact that individuals like their close friends more than an "average peer" and may as a result rate their friend as being higher than average, therefore the friend would not be an objective comparison target.&lt;ref name="Perloff 1986 502–510" /&gt;

=== Egocentrism ===
{{Main|Egocentrism}}
Another explanation for how the better-than-average effect works is egocentrism. This is the idea that an individual places greater importance and significance on their own abilities, characteristics, and behaviors than those of others. Egocentrism is therefore a less overtly self-serving bias. According to egocentrism, individuals will overestimate themselves in relation to others because they believe that they have an advantage that others do not have, as an individual considering their own performance and another's performance will consider their performance to be better, even when they are in fact equal. Kruger (1999) found support for the egocentrism explanation in his research involving participant ratings of their ability on easy and difficult tasks. It was found that individuals were consistent in their ratings of themselves as above the median in the tasks classified as "easy" and below the median in the tasks classified as "difficult", regardless of their actual ability. In this experiment the better-than-average effect was observed when it was suggested to participants that they would be successful, but also a [[worse-than-average effect]] was found when it was suggested that participants would be unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kruger |first= Justin |year=1999 |title= Lake Wobegon Be Gone! The 'Below-Average Effect' and the Egocentric Nature of Comparative Ability Judgments |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=77 |pages=221–232 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.2.221 |pmid= 10474208 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focalism ===
{{Main|Focalism}}
Yet another explanation for the better-than-average effect is "focalism", the idea that greater significance is placed on the object that is the focus of attention. Most studies of the better-than-average effect place greater focus on the self when asking participants to make comparisons (the question will often be phrased with the self being presented before the comparison target—"compare yourself to the average person"). According to focalism this means that the individual will place greater significance on their own ability or characteristic than that of the comparison target. This also means that in theory if, in an experiment on the better-than-average effect, the questions were phrased so that the self and other were switched (e.g., "compare the average peer to yourself") the better-than-average effect should be lessened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =David A. Schkade |author2=[[Daniel Kahneman]] |date=September 1998 |title= Does Living in California Make People Happy? A Focusing Illusion in Judgments of Life Satisfaction |journal =Psychological Science |volume=9 |pages=340–346 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00066 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into focalism has focused primarily on optimistic bias rather than the better-than-average effect. However, two studies found a decreased effect of optimistic bias when participants were asked to compare an average peer to themselves, rather than themselves to an average peer.&lt;ref name="Otten"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Otten |first= W. |author2=J.&amp;nbsp;Van der Pligt |year=1966 |title=Context effects in the measurement of comparative optimism in probability judgments |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume=15 |pages= 80–101 | doi = 10.1521/jscp.1996.15.1.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =J.&amp;nbsp;Richard Eiser |author2 =Sabine Pahl| author3 = Yyvonne R.&amp;nbsp;A.

Windschitl, Kruger &amp; Simms (2003) have conducted research into focalism, focusing specifically on the better-than-average effect, and found that asking participants to estimate their ability and likelihood of success in a task produced results of decreased estimations when they were asked about others' chances of success rather than their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Paul D.

=== "Self versus aggregate" comparisons ===
This idea, put forward by Giladi and Klar, suggests that when making comparisons any single member of a group will tend to evaluate themselves to rank above that group's statistical mean performance level or the median performance level of its members. For example, if an individual is asked to assess his or her own skill at driving compared to the rest of the group, he or she is likely to rate him/herself as an above-average driver. Furthermore, the majority of the group is likely to rate themselves as above average. Research has found this effect in many different areas of human performance and has even generalized it beyond individuals' attempts to draw comparisons involving themselves.&lt;ref name="giladi" /&gt; Findings of this research therefore suggest that rather than individuals evaluating themselves as above average in a self-serving manner, the better-than-average effect is actually due to a general tendency to evaluate any single person or object as better than average.

=== Better-than-average heuristic ===
Alicke and Govorun proposed the idea that, rather than individuals consciously reviewing and thinking about their own abilities, behaviors and characteristics and comparing them to those of others, it is likely that people instead have what they describe as an "automatic tendency to assimilate positively-evaluated social objects toward ideal trait conceptions".&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; For example, if an individual evaluated themselves as honest, they would be likely to then exaggerate their characteristic towards their perceived ideal position on a scale of honesty. Importantly, Alicke noted that this ideal position is not always the top of the scale; for example, with honesty, someone who is always brutally honest may be regarded as rude—the ideal is a balance, perceived differently by different individuals.

=== Non-social explanations ===
The better-than-average effect may not have wholly social origins—judgments about inanimate objects suffer similar distortions.&lt;ref name="giladi"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1 =Eilath E. Giladi |author2= Yechiel Klar |date=December 2002 |title= When Standards Are Wide of the Mark: Nonselective Superiority and Inferiority Biases in Comparative Judgments of Objects and Concepts |journal = [[Journal of Experimental Psychology]] |volume =131 |pages=538–551 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.131.4.538 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moderating factors ==
While illusory superiority has been found to be somewhat self-serving, this does not mean that it will predictably occur—it is not constant. The strength of the effect is moderated by many factors, the main examples of which have been summarized by Alicke and Govorun (2005).&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt;

=== Interpretability/ambiguity of trait ===
This is a phenomenon that Alicke and Govorun have described as "the nature of the judgement dimension" and refers to how subjective (abstract) or objective (concrete) the ability or characteristic being evaluated is.&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; Research by Sedikides &amp; Strube (1997) has found that people are more self-serving (the effect of illusory superiority is stronger) when the event in question is more open to interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = Constantine | last2 = Strube | first2 = Michael J. | year = 1997 | chapter =  Self-Evaluation: To Thine Own Self Be Good, To Thine Own Self Be Sure, To Thine Own Self Be True, and To Thine Own Self be Better | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 209–269 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60018-0 | title = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | isbn = 9780120152292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example social constructs such as [[popularity]] and [[attractiveness]] are more interpretable than characteristics such as intelligence and physical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.86.1.61 | last1 = Reeder | first1 = Glenn D. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = Marilynn B. |date=January 1979 | title = A Schematic Model of Dispositional Attribution in Interpersonal Perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 86 | issue =1 | pages = 61–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been partly attributed also to the need for a believable self-view.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Swann, Jr. and Michael D. Buhrmester (2003). [https://books.google.com/?id=kGK-dfHpM4gC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;lpg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q=Self%20Verification%3A%20The%20search%20for%20coherence "Self-Verification: The Search for Coherence"]. In Mark R. Leary and June Price Tangney (Eds.), ''Handbook of Self and Identity'' (pp. 367–383). New York: Guildford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that ambiguity moderates illusory superiority has empirical research support from a study involving two conditions: in one, participants were given criteria for assessing a trait as ambiguous or unambiguous, and in the other participants were free to assess the traits according to their own criteria. It was found that the effect of illusory superiority was greater in the condition where participants were free to assess the traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1082 | last1 = Dunning | first1 = David | last2 = Meyerowitz | first2 = Judith A. | last3 = Holzberg | first3 = Amy D. | year = 1989 | title = Ambiguity and Self-Evaluation: The Role of Idiosyncratic Trait Definitions in Self-Serving Assessments of Ability | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 1082–1090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of illusory superiority have also been found to be strongest when people rate themselves on abilities at which they are totally incompetent. These subjects have the greatest disparity between their actual performance (at the low end of the distribution) and their self-rating (placing themselves above average). This [[Dunning–Kruger effect]] is interpreted as a lack of [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] ability to recognize their own incompetence.&lt;ref name="unskilled" /&gt;

=== Method of comparison ===
The method used in research into illusory superiority has been found to have an implication on the strength of the effect found. Most studies into illusory superiority involve a comparison between an individual and an average peer, of which there are two methods: direct comparison and indirect comparison. A direct comparison—which is more commonly used—involves the participant rating themselves and the average peer on the same scale, from "below average" to "above average"&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alicke | first1 = Mark D. | last2 = Klotz | first2 = M. L. | last3 = Breitenbecher | first3 = David L. | last4 = Yurak | first4 = Tricia J. | last5 = Vredenburg | first5 = Debbie S. | year = 1995 | title = Personal Contact, Individuation, and the Better-Than-Average Effect | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 68 | issue = 5| pages = 804–825 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.68.5.804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and results in participants being far more self-serving.&lt;ref name="Otten" /&gt; Researchers have suggested that this occurs due to the closer comparison between the individual and the average peer, however use of this method means that it is impossible to know whether a participant has overestimated themselves, underestimated the average peer, or both.

The indirect method of comparison involves participants rating themselves and the average peer on separate scales and the illusory superiority effect is found by taking the average peer score away from the individual's score (with a higher score indicating a greater effect). While the indirect comparison method is used less often it is more informative in terms of whether participants have overestimated themselves or underestimated the average peer, and can therefore provide more information about the nature of illusory superiority.&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz" /&gt;

=== Comparison target ===
The nature of the comparison target is one of the most fundamental moderating factors of the effect of illusory superiority, and there are two main issues relating to the comparison target that need to be considered.

First, research into illusory superiority is distinct in terms of the comparison target because an individual compares themselves with a hypothetical average peer rather than a tangible person. Alicke et al. (1995) found that the effect of illusory superiority was still present but was significantly reduced when participants compared themselves with real people (also participants in the experiment, who were seated in the same room), as opposed to when participants compared themselves with an average peer. This suggests that research into illusory superiority may itself be biasing results and finding a greater effect than would actually occur in real life.&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz" /&gt;

Further research into the differences between comparison targets involved four conditions where participants were at varying proximity to an interview with the comparison target: watching live in the same room; watching on tape; reading a written transcript; or making self-other comparisons with an average peer. It was found that when the participant was further removed from the interview situation (in the tape observation and transcript conditions) the effect of illusory superiority was found to be greater. Researchers asserted that these findings suggest that the effect of illusory superiority is reduced by two main factors—individuation of the target and live contact with the target.

Second, Alicke et al.'s (1995) studies investigated whether the negative connotations to the word "average" may have an effect on the extent to which individuals exhibit illusory superiority, namely whether the use of the word "average" increases illusory superiority. Participants were asked to evaluate themselves, the average peer and a person whom they had sat next to in the previous experiment, on various dimensions. It was found that they placed themselves highest, followed by the real person, followed by the average peer, however the average peer was consistently placed above the mean point on the scale, suggesting that the word "average" did not have a negative effect on the participant's view of the average peer.&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz" /&gt;

=== Controllability ===
An important moderating factor of the effect of illusory superiority is the extent to which an individual believes they are able to control and change their position on the dimension concerned. According to Alicke &amp; Govorun positive characteristics that an individual believes are within their control are more self-serving, and negative characteristics that are seen as uncontrollable are less detrimental to self-enhancement.&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; This theory was supported by Alicke's (1985) research, which found that individuals rated themselves as higher than an average peer on positive controllable traits and lower than an average peer on negative uncontrollable traits. The idea, suggested by these findings, that individuals believe that they are responsible for their success and some other factor is responsible for their failure is known as the [[self-serving bias]].

=== Individual differences of judge ===
Personality characteristics vary widely between people and have been found to moderate the effects of illusory superiority, one of the main examples of this is self-esteem. Brown (1986) found that in self-evaluations of positive characteristics participants with higher self-esteem showed greater illusory superiority bias than participants with lower self-esteem.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Additionally, another study found that participants pre-classified as having high self-esteem tended to interpret ambiguous traits in a self-serving way, whereas participants pre-classified as having low self-esteem did not do this.&lt;ref name="suls_lemos_stewart" /&gt;

== Worse-than-average effect ==
{{Main|Worse-than-average effect}}
In contrast to what is commonly believed, research has found that better-than-average effects are not universal. In fact, much recent research has found the opposite effect in many tasks, especially if they were more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.005 | last1 = Moore | first1 = Don A. |date=January 2007 | title = Not So Above Average After All: When People Believe They Are Worse Than Average and Its Implications for Theories of Bias in Social Comparison | ssrn = 775086 | journal = Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 42–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''Incremental validity''' is a type of [[validity (statistics)|validity]] that is used to determine whether a new [[psychometric]] assessment will increase the [[Validity (logic)|predictive ability]] beyond that provided by an existing method of assessment.&lt;ref name="Sackett"&gt;Sackett, P. R. &amp; Lievens, F. 2008. "Personnel selection." ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 59, 419-450&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, incremental validity seeks to answer if the new test adds much information that might be obtained with simpler, already existing methods.&lt;ref&gt;Lillenfield et al. 2005 "What's wrong with this picture?" ''www.psychologicalscience.org'' http://www.psychologicalscience.org/newsresearch/publications/journals/sa1_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition and Examples==
When an assessment is used with the purpose of predicting an outcome (perhaps another test score or some other behavioral measure), a new instrument must show that it is able to increase our knowledge or prediction of the outcome variable beyond what is already known based on existing instruments.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt; {{cite journal |last= Haynes |first= S.N. |last2= Lench |first2= H.C. |date= 2003 |title= Incremental Validity of New Clinical Assessment Measures |url= http://heatherlench.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/incremental-validity.pdf |journal= Psychological Assessment |volume= 15 |issue= 4 |pages= 456-466|doi=  10.1037/1040-3590.15.4.456 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive example may be a clinician who uses an interview technique as well as a specific questionnaire to determine if a patient has mental illness and has better success at determining mental illness than a clinician who uses the interview technique alone. Thus, the specific questionnaire would be considered incrementally valid. Because the questionnaire in conjunction with the interview produced more accurate determinations, and added information for the clinician, the questionnaire is incrementally valid.

==Statistical Tests==
Incremental validity is usually assessed using [[Linear_regression|multiple regression]] methods. A regression model with other variables is fitted to the data first and then the focal variable is added to the model.  A significant change in the [[R-square]] statistic (using an [[F-test]] to determine significance) is interpreted as an indication that the newly added variable offers significant additional predictive power for the dependent variable over variables previously included in the regression model. 

Recall that the R-square statistic in [[linear regression|multiple regression]] reflects the percent of variance accounted for in the Y variable using all X variables. Thus, the change in R-square will reflect the percent of variance explained by the variable added to the model. The change in R-square is more appropriate than simply looking at the raw correlations because the raw correlations do not reflect the overlap of the newly introduced measure and the existing measures.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt;

An example this method is in the prediction of college grade point average ([[GPA]]) where high school GPA and admissions test scores (e.g., [[SAT]], [[ACT (Test)|ACT]]) usually account for a large proportion of variance in college GPA. The use of admissions tests is supported by incremental validity evidence. For example, the pre-2000 SAT correlated .34 with freshman GPA while high school GPA correlated .36 with freshman GPA.&lt;ref name="Bridgeman"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bridgeman |first= B. |last2= McCamley-Jenkins |first2= L. |last3=Ervin |first3=N. |date= 2000 |title= Predictions of Freshman Grade-Point Average From the Revised and Recentered SAT® I: Reasoning Test|url= http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2000-1-predictions-freshman-gpa-revised-recentered-sat-reasoning.pdf |journal= ETS RR 00-1 |publisher= Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ  |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might seem that both measures are strong predictors of freshman GPA, but in fact high school GPA and SAT scores are also strongly correlated, so we need to test for how much predictive power we get from the SAT when we account for high school GPA. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when high school GPA included in the model. In this case, high school GPA accounts for 13% of the variance in freshman GPA and the combination of high school GPA plus SAT accounts for 20% of the variance in freshman GPA. Therefore, the SAT adds 7 percentage points to our predictive power. If this is significant and deemed an important improvement, then we can say that the SAT has incremental validity over using high school GPA alone to predict freshman GPA. Any new admissions criterion or test must add additional predictive power (incremental validity) in order to be useful in predicting college GPA when high school GPA and test scores are already known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9627">In [[mathematics]], for a [[sequence]] of complex numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... the '''infinite product'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 a_2 a_3 \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

is defined to be the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the [[Multiplication#Capital Pi notation|partial products]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n'' increases without bound.  The product is said to ''[[Limit of a sequence|converge]]'' when the limit exists and is not zero. Otherwise the product is said to ''diverge''.  A limit of zero is treated specially in order to obtain results analogous to those for [[Infinite series|infinite sums]]. Some sources allow convergence to 0 if there are only a finite number of zero factors and the product of the non-zero factors is non-zero, but for simplicity we will not allow that here. If the product converges, then the limit of the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n'' increases without bound must be 1, while the converse is in general not true.

The best known examples of infinite products are probably some of the formulae for [[pi|&amp;pi;]], such as the following two products, respectively by [[Viète]] ([[Viète's formula]], the first published infinite product in mathematics) and [[John Wallis]] ([[Wallis product]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\pi} = \frac{ \sqrt{2} }{ 2 } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} }{ 2 } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}} }{ 2 } \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2} =  \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{9} \cdot \cdots = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{ 4n^2 }{ 4n^2 - 1 } \right). &lt;/math&gt;

== Convergence criteria ==
The product of positive real numbers
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt;
converges to a nonzero real number if and only if the sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \log(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
converges. This allows the translation of convergence criteria for infinite sums into convergence criteria for infinite products. The same criterion applies to products of arbitrary complex numbers (including negative reals) if the logarithm is understood as a fixed [[Complex logarithm#Branches of the complex logarithm|branch of logarithm]] which satisfies ln(1) = 0, with the proviso that the infinite product diverges when infinitely many ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' fall outside the domain of ln, whereas finitely many such ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be ignored in the sum.

For products of reals in which each &lt;math&gt;a_n\ge1&lt;/math&gt;, written as, for instance, &lt;math&gt;a_n=1+p_n,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_n\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the bounds

:&lt;math&gt;1+\sum_{n=1}^{N} p_n \le \prod_{n=1}^{N} \left( 1 + p_n \right) \le \exp \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N}p_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

show that the infinite product converges if the infinite sum of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges. This relies on the [[Monotone convergence theorem]]. We can show the converse by observing that, if &lt;math&gt;p_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log(1+p_n)}{p_n} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\log(1+x)}{x} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and by the [[limit comparison test]] it follows that the two series 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \log(1+p_n) \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n=1}^\infty p_n,&lt;/math&gt;

are equivalent meaning that either they both converge or they both diverge.

The same proof also shows that if &lt;math&gt;a_n = 1 - q_n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;0\le q_n &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\prod_{n=1}^\infty (1-q_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges to a non-zero number if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty q_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.

If the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \log(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; diverges to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the sequence of partial products of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to zero.  The infinite product is said to '''diverge to zero'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Methods of Mathematical Physics | series=Cambridge Mathematical Library | first1=Harold | last1=Jeffreys | author1-link=Harold Jeffreys | first2=Bertha Swirles | last2=Jeffreys | author2-link=Bertha Swirles | edition=3rd revised | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year= 1999 | isbn=1107393671 | page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product representations of functions==
{{main|Weierstrass factorization theorem}}

One important result concerning infinite products is that every [[entire function]] ''f''(''z'') (that is, every function that is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] over the entire [[complex number|complex plane]]) can be factored into an infinite product of entire functions, each with at most a single root.  In general, if ''f'' has a root of order ''m'' at the origin and has other complex roots at ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... (listed with multiplicities equal to their orders), then

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^m e^{\phi(z)} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z}{u_n} \right) \exp \left\lbrace \frac{z}{u_n} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{z}{u_n}\right)^2 + \cdots + \frac{1}{\lambda_n} \left(\frac{z}{u_n}\right)^{\lambda_n} \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative integers that can be chosen to make the product converge, and ''φ''(''z'') is some entire function (which means the term before the product will have no roots in the complex plane).  The above factorization is not unique, since it depends on the choice of values for ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, for most functions, there will be some minimum non-negative integer ''p'' such that ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p'' gives a convergent product, called the [[Weierstrass factorization theorem|canonical product representation]]. This ''p'' is called the ''rank'' of the canonical product. &lt;!-- The ''genus'' is the (is it max? or min?) of the degree of φ and ''p''. --&gt; In the event that ''p'' = 0, this takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^m e^{\phi(z)} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z}{u_n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be regarded as a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], since for polynomials, the product becomes finite and ''φ''(''z'') is constant.

In addition to these examples, the following representations are of special note:

{| cellspacing=15
|- valign=top
| Simple pole
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{c- z}=\prod_{n=1}^\infty e^{\frac{1}{n}\,\left( \frac{z}{c}\right)^n}&lt;/math&gt;
| 
|- valign=top
| [[Sinc function]]
| &lt;math&gt;\textrm{sinc}(\pi z) =\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

| [[Gamma function]]
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)} = z e^{\gamma z} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 + \frac{z}{n}\right) e^{-\frac{z}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
| [[Schlömilch]]

| &lt;math&gt;\sigma(z) = z\prod_{\omega \in \Lambda_{*}} \left(1-\frac{z}{\omega}\right)e^{\frac{z^2}{2\omega^2}+\frac{z}{\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
| Here &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice without the origin.
|- valign=top
| [[Q-Pochhammer symbol]]
| &lt;math&gt;(z;q)_\infty = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (1-zq^n)&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(a,b) &amp;=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}} b^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \\
&amp;= \prod_{n=0}^\infty (1+a^{n+1}b^n)(1+a^nb^{n+1})(1-a^{n+1}b^{n+1})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
| An expression of the [[Jacobi triple product]], also used in the expression of the Jacobi [[theta function]]
|- valign=top
| [[Riemann zeta function]]
| &lt;math&gt;\zeta(z) = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 - p_n^{-z}}&lt;/math&gt;
| Here ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the sequence of [[prime number]]s. This is a special case of the [[Euler product]].
|}

The last of these is not a product representation of the same sort discussed above, as ''ζ'' is not entire. Rather, the above product representation of ''ζ''(''z'') converges precisely for Re(''z'') &amp;gt; 1, where it is an analytic function. By techniques of [[analytic continuation]], this function can be extended uniquely to an analytic function (still denoted ''ζ''(''z'')) on the whole complex plane except at the point ''z'' = 1, where it has a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]].

The '''integral length scale''' measures the correlation distance of a [[Process theory|process]] in terms of space or time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Neill|first1=P. L.|last2=Nicolaides|first2=D.|last3=Honnery|first3=D.|last4=Soria|first4=J.|title=Autocorrelation Functions and the Determination of Integral Length with Reference to Experimental and Numerical Data|journal=15th Australasian Fluid Mechanics Conference|date=13–17 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In essence, it looks at the overall memory of the process and how it is influenced by previous positions and [[parameter]]s. An intuitive example would be the case in which you have very low [[Reynolds number]] flows (e.g., a ''Stokes'' flow), where the flow is fully reversible and thus fully correlated with previous [[particle]] positions. This concept may be extended to [[turbulence]], where it may be thought of as the time during which a particle is influenced by its previous position.

The mathematical expressions for integral scales are:

&lt;math&gt;
\Tau = \int_{0}^{\infty}  \rho (\tau) d\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
L = \int_{0}^{\infty}  \rho (r) dr
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\Tau&lt;/math&gt; is the integral time scale, L is the integral length scale, and &lt;math&gt;\rho(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho(r)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[autocorrelation]] with respect to time and space respectively.

In isotropic homogeneous turbulence, the integral length scale &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the weighted average of the inverse [[wavenumber]], i.e.,

&lt;math&gt;
\ell=\int_{0}^{\infty} k^{-1} E(k) dk \left/ \int_{0}^{\infty} E(k) dk \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the energy spectrum.

'''James Anderson Dombrowski''' (January 17, 1897 - May 2, 1983) was a southern white [[Methodist]] minister and intellectual who was active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. He lived in [[New Orleans]] from 1946 until his death but was involved in public affairs across the country.

==Early life and education==
James Dombrowski was born in [[Tampa, Florida]], to William Dombrowski and the former Isabella Skinner. He attended [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s in Tampa and [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] from Methodist-affiliated [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in 1923. Dombrowski also attended [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and [[Columbia University]], both in [[New York City]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] from Columbia in 1933. Dombrowski studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Methodist clergyman [[Harry F. Ward]].

Dombrowski enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War I]], and served from October 1917 to March 1919 as an [[airplane]] [[mechanic]] near [[Paris, France|Paris]]. He obtained the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]].

He was the first secretary of the Emory University Alumni Association and the founding editor of ''Emory Alumnus''. In 1926, he became the assistant [[pastor]] of a Methodist church in [[Berkeley, California]]. He married the former Ellen Krida of New York, the daughter of Arthur Krida and the former Johanna Kunkel. There were no children.

==Activist in South==
Dombrowski was cofounder with [[Myles Horton]] and [[educator]] [[Don West (educator)|Don West]] of the [[Highlander Folk School]] in [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]] in [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]] in southeastern [[Tennessee]]. He was an administrator at Highlander from 1933 to 1942. This institution took an early lead in the civil rights movement, and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Rosa Parks]] obtained instruction there during the 1950s. So did various southern leaders in [[organized labor]]. Highlander was a particular ''bête noire'' to [[Racial segregation|segregationists]], who claimed that it was a [[communist]]-oriented organization. In 1957, a photograph was taken of an audience at the school, which showed King sitting on the front row next to [[Abner Berry]], the correspondent for the communist [[newspaper]], the ''[[Daily Worker]]''. King's enemies posted the photograph on billboards across the South in an attempt to discredit the civil rights movement.

Dombrowski also founded the Conference of Younger Churchmen of the South, established in 1934. He was executive director of both the Southern Conference for Human Welfare from 1942 to 1946 and the Southern Conference Educational Fund from 1946 to 1966. He edited the liberal journal ''Southern Patriot'' from 1942 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, ''And Promises to Keep'', pp. 104-111, 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice from 1975 until his death.

Dombrowski was the primary defendant in a landmark [[civil liberties]] case decided in 1965 by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In ''[[Dombrowski v. Pfister]]'', the court struck down a [[Louisiana]] law that attempted to force members of anti-segregation groups to register as pro-communist [[subversive]]s. Dombrowski briefly joined the [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] in the 1930s but then became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] during [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]. He denied charges of being communist, and he had left the Highlander School before segregationists challenged it for loyalty.

Under Dombrowski's leadership, a number of white southerners joined the Southern Conference Educational Fund and labored to end segregation and the disfranchisement of blacks in the South.

Dombrowski wrote ''The Early Days of Christian Socialism in America'' (1937). He was also an engraver and artist. Some of his paintings were donated to the [[University of New Orleans]].

He died in New Orleans. His body was cremated.

{{More citations needed|date=October 2013}}
The '''letter of introduction''', along with the [[visiting card]], was an important part of polite social interaction in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It remains important in formal situations, such as an [[ambassador]] presenting his or her [[credential]]s (a [[letter of credence]]), and in certain business circles.

In general, a person would not interact socially with others unless they had been properly introduced, whether in person or by letter.  A person of lower social status would request a patron of higher social status to write a letter of introduction to a third party, also of higher social status than the first person, but lower than the second person.  It was important to observe the niceties of [[etiquette]] in requesting, writing and presenting such letters, in such matters as the quality of the paper used, and whether it would be delivered unsealed to allow the requesting party to read it.  For example, it was best practice to deliver a letter of introduction to the intended recipient with a [[visiting card]], to allow the recipient to reciprocate by calling upon the sender the next day.

When [[Benjamin Franklin]] served as Ambassador to France (1776–1785) he was besieged by those traveling to America who desired letters of introduction. With his inimitable sense of style and humor, Ambassador Franklin drafted the following letter: 
{{quote|The bearer of this, who is going to America, presses me to give him a letter of recommendation, though I know nothing of him, not even his name. This may seem extraordinary, but I assure you that it is not uncommon here. Sometimes, indeed, one unknown person brings another, equally unknown, to recommend him; and sometimes they recommend one another. As to this gentleman, I must refer you to himself for his character and merits, with which he is certainly better acquainted than I can possibly be. I recommend him, however, to those civilities which every stranger of whom one knows no harm has a right to; and I request you will do him all good offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenbrun |first=David  |title=Triumph in Paris: The Exploits of Benjamin Franklin |url= |accessdate= |year=1976 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013854-8 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12053">{{math|}}The '''Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)''' is an alphanumerical [[classification scheme]] collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. The MSC is used by many mathematics [[Academic journal|journals]], which ask authors of [[research papers]] and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.

== Structure ==

The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.

The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:

* '''53''' is the classification for [[differential geometry]]
* '''53A''' is the classification for classical differential geometry
* '''53A45''' is the classification for [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[tensor]] analysis

=== First level ===
At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for "[[History]] and [[Biography]]", "[[Mathematics Education]]", and for the overlap with different sciences. [[Physics]] (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:
* [[Fluid mechanics]]
* [[Quantum mechanics]]
* [[Geophysics]]
* [[Optics]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]

All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.

=== Second level ===

The second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.

For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is '''53''', and the second-level codes are:
* '''A''' for classical differential geometry
* '''B''' for local differential geometry
* '''C''' for global differential geometry
* '''D''' for symplectic geometry and contact geometry

In addition, the special second level code "-" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:

* '''53-00''' General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.)
* '''53-01''' Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.)
* '''53-02''' Research exposition (monographs, survey articles)
* '''53-03''' Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01)
* '''53-04''' Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming)
* '''53-06''' Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc.

The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use '''53-''' as a classification. Either '''53''' on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.

=== Third level ===

Third level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.

The third-level code '''99''' exists in every category and means ''none of the above, but in this section''

== Using the scheme ==

The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like

MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;

=={{anchor|MOS|AMS Classification|MSC1990|MSC2000|MSC2010}}History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
According to the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) help page about MSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html#mscp]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's ''Mathematical Offprint Service'' (MOS scheme), the ''AMS Classification'' was established for the classification of reviews in ''Mathematical Reviews'' in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, [[Zentralblatt für Mathematik]] started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as ''MSC1990'', ''MSC2000'' and ''MSC2010''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Wegner. ''Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC''. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msc2020.org Announcement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.

== Relation to other classification schemes ==

For physics papers the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the [[arXiv]].

The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for [[computer science]]. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.

The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

It is used in many countries to acknowledge that a comparison being made requires certain obvious alterations, which are left unstated. It is not to be confused with the similar ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', which excludes any changes other than those explicitly mentioned. ''Mutatis mutandis'' is increasingly replaced by non-Latin equivalents, such as [[without loss of generality]], &lt;ref&gt;Reddit article https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/658xc3/when_do_you_say_without_loss_of_generality_wlog/ retrieved 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;but is still used in [[law]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], and [[philosophy]]. In particular, in [[logic]], it is encountered when discussing [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]], as a shorthand for all the initial and derived changes which have been previously discussed.

{{anchor|Etymology|Origin}}

==Latin==
The phrase ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|mutatis mutandis}}}}''—now sometimes written ''{{lang|la|mūtātīs mūtandīs}}'' to show [[vowel length]]—does not appear in surviving [[Classical Latin|classical literature]]. It is [[Medieval Latin]], first attested in British sources in 1272.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd&amp;nbsp;ed. "mutatis mutandis, ''adv.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both words are [[participle]]s of the [[Latin]] [[verb]] ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|mutare}}}}'' ("to move; to change; to exchange"). ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:mutatus|Mutatus, -a, -um]]}}'' is its [[perfect tense|perfect]] [[passive voice|passive]] participle ("changed; having been changed"). ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:mutandus|Mutandus, -a, -um]]}}'' is its [[gerundive]], which functions both as a [[future tense|future]] [[passive voice|passive]] participle ("to be changed; going to be changed") and as a verbal adjective or noun expressing necessity ("needing to be changed; things needing to be changed").  The phrase is an [[Latin grammar#Ablative absolute|ablative absolute]], using the [[ablative case]] to show that the clause is a necessary condition for the rest of the sentence.

{{anchor|Plain English}}

==English==
''Mutatis mutandis'' was first [[loanword|borrowed]] into English in the 16th century, but continues to be [[italics|italicized]] as a foreign phrase.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Although many similar [[adverbial phrase]]s are treated as part of the sentence, ''mutatis mutandis'' is usually set apart by [[comma]]s or in some other fashion. The nearest English equivalent to an ablative absolute is the [[nominative absolute]], so that a literal translation will either use the [[nominative case]] ("those things which need to be changed having been changed") or a [[prepositional phrase|preposition]] ("with the things needing to be changed having been changed"). More often, the idea is expressed more tersely ("with the necessary changes") or using [[subordinating conjunctions]] and a [[dependent clause]] ("once the necessary adjustments are made").

The [[legal Latin|legal use]] of the term is somewhat specialized. As glossed by [[Shira Scheindlin]], judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District]] of [[Courts of New York|New York]], for a 1998 case: "This Latin phrase simply means that the necessary changes in details, such as names and places, will be made but everything else will remain the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court |litigants = In re McMahon |vol = 235 |reporter = B.R. |opinion = 527 |pinpoint = 536, footnote 7 |court = S.D.N.Y. |date = 30 Nov 1998 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1552575106454200922&amp;q=235+B.R.+527&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Plain English|Plain English movements]], some countries attempted to replace their law codes' [[legal Latin]] with English equivalents.

===Examples===
* "I believe the soul in Paradise must enjoy something nearer to a perpetual vigorous adulthood than to any other state we know. At least that is my hope. Not that Paradise could disappoint, but I believe Boughton is right to enjoy the imagination of heaven as the best pleasure of this world. I don't see how he can be entirely wrong, approaching it that way. I certainly don't mind the thought of your mother finding me a strong young man. There is neither male nor female, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but, ''mutatis mutandis'', it would be a fine thing. That ''mutandis''! Such a burden on one word!"—[[Marilynne Robinson]], ''[[Gilead (novel)|Gilead]]''.
*"To illustrate the point with trivial stereotypical examples from British society: just as male heterosexuals are free to enjoy themselves playing rugby, drinking beer and talking about girls with their mates, so male homosexuals are to be free to enjoy themselves going to Kylie concerts, drinking exotically coloured cocktails and talking about boys with their straight female mates. ''Mutatis mutandis''—and in many cases the adaptations would obviously be great—the same must apply to other societies. In other words, gay men are to be as free as their straight equivalents in the society concerned to live their lives in the way that is natural to them as gay men, without the fear of persecution."—[[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Lord Rodger of Earlsferry]], ''[[HJ and HT v Home Secretary]]'', [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|British Supreme Court]], 2010

==Other languages==
The phrase appears in other European languages as well. A passage of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]'' includes "...j'ai le fils d'un de mes amis qui, mutatis mutandis, est comme vous..." ("A friend of mine has a son whose case, ''mutatis mutandis'', is very much like yours.") The [[German Ministry of Justice]], similar to the Plain English advocates above, now eschews its use. Their official English translation of the [[German Civil Code|Civil Code]] now reads:&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#BGBengl_000G1 See the German Civil Code]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'''Section 27 (Appointment of and management by the board).''' ...(3) The management by the board is governed by the provisions on mandate in sections 664 to 670 ''with the necessary modifications.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''Nazi punk''' is a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] who is part of the [[punk subculture]]. The term also describes the related music genre,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Amy. ''The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists.'' Backbeat Books, 2007. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes also referred to as '''hatecore'''. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of [[punk rock]], but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some [[Minority groups|ethnic minorities]], [[Jews]], [[homosexuality |homosexuals]],[[anarchism| anarchists]], and other perceived enemies. 

It is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the [[anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. While early punks including [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]] incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika|Swastikas]], this has commonly been interpreted as an attempt to shock, rather than as a genuine belief in principles of Nazism.  In the long-standing band [[The Exploited]], [[Wattie Buchan]] has been regularly questioned about his swastika tattoo and he has constantly denied being a racist.&lt;ref name=Documentary&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E Documentary on the history of the band The Exploited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several [[English people|English]] punks, as well as forming a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984'' (Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger, ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk.'' (Routledge, 1999), pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the [[white power skinhead]] band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detour-records.co.uk/STRAPS.htm "The Straps: History"]&lt;/ref&gt; They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the [[United States]] by the early 1980s in the [[hardcore punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Mark. ''Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital.'' Akashic Books, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Michael. ''Globalizing the Streets.'' Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nsumi''', or "Nsumi Collective" is an art collective, initially formed as a New School student association called Nsumiscope in the fall of 2001 the week directly following September 11th.  Their projects last for years at a time, and are not always documented or publicized. 

Nsumi's work occurs mostly within the back-end of the art world where ideas wobble around before becoming embodied as art.  Members of Nsumi have claimed that the group spawns art collectives and experimental groups through a [[gift economy]] consulting project and other tactics, such as workshops, art exhibitions and performances, zines, street classes, academic research, and public interventions.  The group's changing membership has included educators, artists, scientists, architects, landscape designers, curators, collectors, and others.

Nsumi operates fluidly, frequently collaborating with artists and collectives including [[Trevor Paglen]], [[Brandon Ballengée]], [[Rainer Ganahl]], AUNTS Collective and Peter Fend, in addition to those who participate anonymously.

Their insider/outsider practice involves a range of disciplines including traditional [[art]], [[trend analysis]] and [[Network theory]], [[urban planning]] and [[Cartography|mapping]], interventions within [[ecosystems]], [[grassroots]] political organizing and [[prefigurative politics]].

Sometimes Nsumi fully or partially joins other art groups, adopting an individual or quasi-individual identity. Occasionally the group will exchange or swap members with different collectives, bring on temporary members, or work with artists who join the group for one-off events and exhibitions. Nsumi blurs its own boundaries since it is unclear which identity the group is operating through at a given moment or who exactly is involved. Nsumi operates under different monikers, such as Lightning Chasers, Black Magic Guild and Nsumi Group, and has been known to appear in the same group exhibition under multiple individual and group names.

Nsumi also appears in more conventional art exhibitions at galleries, universities and museums including the Queens Museum, Momenta Gallery, Deitch Projects and the Center for Architecture in New York City.  Their work has appeared in Satya magazine, ARTE Television and TRACKS TV in Europe, Total Theatre Magazine, The New York Times, Archinect, The Economist, the New York Sun, and Art News.

Between 2013 and 2014 Nsumi launched two projects that blur the lines between creative production and grassroots politics.  Banner Action (2013) is a performance involving protest banners, formal [[decentralization]], [[semiotics]] and [[memetics]]. Oubliettes (2014) is a project about prison abolition and the human rights crimes at the MDC federal prison in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]], following up on their 2005 collaboration with Trevor Paglen. The project resulted in a protest outside MDC prison on New Year's Eve, December 2014.

(1996)."&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Haslam | first1 = Alex | last2 = Oakes | first2 = Penny | last3 = Turner | first3 = John | last4 = McGarty | first4 = Craig | editor-last = Sorrentino | editor-first = Richard | editor2-last = Higgins | editor2-first = Edward | year = 1996 |chapter = Social identity, self-categorization, and the perceived homogeneity of ingroups and outgroups: The interaction between social motivation and cognition |title = Handbook of Motivation and Cognition: Foundations of Social Behavior | volume = 3 | pages = 182–222 | location = New York | publisher = Guilford Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEQvoK-213MC|ISBN=9781572300521}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter referring to perceived outgroup variability unrelated to perceptions of the ingroup.

The out-group homogeneity effect is part of a broader field of research that examines perceived group variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | year = 2012 | title = They're all the same!...but for several different reasons: A review of the multicausal nature of perceived group variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 367–372 | doi = 10.1177/0963721412457363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area includes in-group homogeneity effects as well as out-group homogeneity effects, and it also deals with perceived group variability effects that are not linked to in-group/out-group membership, such as effects that are related to the power, status, and size of groups.

The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.&lt;ref name=Rubin2004&gt;Rubin, M., Hewstone, M., Crisp, R. J., Voci, A., &amp; Richards, Z. (2004). Gender out-group homogeneity: The roles of differential familiarity, gender differences, and group size. In V. Yzerbyt, C. M. Judd, &amp; O. Corneille (Eds.), The psychology of group perception: Perceived variability, entitativity, and essentialism (pp. 203-220). New York: Psychology Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA9Qg-fDga8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=rubin+gender+out-group+homogeneity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZQQxT7-AAo6ZiQen14j3BA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rubin%20gender%20out-group%20homogeneity&amp;f=false [View&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of this effect on [[stereotyping]] have been noted.&lt;ref name="Rubin &amp; Badea (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rubin| first=Mark| last2=Badea | first2=Constantina| title=Why Do People Perceive Ingroup Homogeneity on Ingroup Traits and Outgroup Homogeneity on Outgroup Traits?| journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin| date=2007| volume=33| issue=1| pages=31–42| doi=10.1177/0146167206293190| pmid=17178928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those central tendencies or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Judd|first1=Charles M.|last2=Ryan|first2=Carey S.|last3=Park|first3=Bernadette|title=Accuracy in the judgment of in-group and out-group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=3|year=1991|pages=366–379|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.3.366|pmid=1941509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outgroup homogeneity effect is sometimes referred to as "outgroup homogeneity bias". Such nomenclature hints at a broader [[Self-categorization theory#Meta-theoretical debate|meta-theoretical debate]] that is present in the field of [[social psychology]]. This debate centres on the validity of heightened perceptions of ingroup and outgroup homogeneity, where some researchers view the homogeneity effect as an example of cognitive bias and error, while other researchers view the effect as an example of normal and often adaptive social perception.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;

==Empirical support==
Another example of this phenomenon comes from a study where researchers asked 90 sorority members to judge the degree of within-group similarity for their own and 2 other groups. It was found that every participant judged their own sorority members to be more dissimilar than the members of the other groups.&lt;ref name="Park &amp; Rothbart (1982)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Bernadette | last2 = Rothbart | first2 = Myron | year = 1982 | title = Perception of out-group homogeneity and level of social categorization | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1051–1068 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.6.1051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial investigation===
{{Main|Cross-race effect}}

In an experiment, researchers revealed that people of other races do seem to look more alike than members of one's own race. When white students were shown faces of a few white and a few black individuals, they later more accurately recognized white faces they had seen and often falsely recognized black faces not seen before. The opposite results were found when subjects consisted of black individuals.&lt;ref name="Chance &amp; Goldstein (1981)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chance | first1 = June| last2 = Goldstein | first2 = Alvin | year = 1981 | title = Depth of processing in response to own and other race faces | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 475–480 | doi=10.1177/014616728173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
This bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. One might think that people thought members of their own groups were more varied and different simply because they knew them better and thus have more information about ingroups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linville|first=Patricia W.|last2=Fischer |first2=Gregory W.|last3=Salovey|first3=Peter|title=Perceived distributions of the characteristics of in-group and out-group members: Empirical evidence and a computer simulation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989 | volume=57| issue=2| pages=165–188| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.165|pmid=2760805}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is actually not the case. The out-group homogeneity bias was found between groups such as "men" and "women" who obviously interact frequently.&lt;ref name=Rubin2004/&gt;

Elsewhere, this difference is attributed to differences in how people store or process in-group versus out-group information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Bernadette|last2=Judd |first2=Charles M.|title=Measures and models of perceived group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1990|volume=59|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Thomas M.|last2=Carpenter |first2=Sandra L. |last3=Sedikides |first3=Constantine| last4=Li|first4=Fan|title=Differential processing of in-group and outgroup information.| journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| date=1993| volume=64| issue=1| pages=21–34| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this concept has been challenged due to some cases in which in-groups view themselves as homogeneous.  Researchers have postulated that such an effect is present when viewing a group as homogeneous helps to promote in-group solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lee| first=Yueh-Ting| last2=Ottati | first2=Victor| title=Determinants of ingroup and outgroup perceptions of heterogeneity: An investigation of Sino-American stereotypes.| journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology| date=1993| volume=24| issue=3| pages=298–318| doi=10.1177/0022022193243003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments on the topic found that in-group homogeneity is displayed when people who highly identify with a group are presented with stereotypical information about that group.&lt;ref name="De Cremer 138–146"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title=    Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138–146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A self-categorization theory account===

[[Self-categorization theory]] attributes the outgroup homogeneity effect to the differing contexts that are present when perceiving outgroups and ingroups.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."&gt;{{cite book |last=McGarty |first=C. |year=1999 |title=Categorization in social psychology |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi |isbn=0-7619-5953-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For outgroups, a perceiver will experience an intergroup context and therefore attend to differences between the two groups. Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an ''intragroup'' context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between “us” and “them” (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between “me” and “others in the group”) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.

The self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous.&lt;ref name=" Haslam, et al. (1995)."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haslam |first=S. A. |last2=Oakes |first2=P. J. |last3=Turner |first3=J. C. |last4=McGarty |first4=C. |year=1995 |title=Social categorization and group homogeneity: changes in the perceived applicability of stereotype content as a function of comparative context and trait favourableness |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=139–160 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1995.tb01054.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt; The self-categorization theory account eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outgroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;

===A social identity theory account===

Another body of research looked at ingroup and outgroup homogeneity from the perspective of [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt; While complementary to the self-categorization theory account, this body of research was concerned more with specific homogeneity effects associated with the motivations of perceivers. They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative ''ingroup'' homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of [[minority group]]s would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem. This was empirically supported.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Brown (1987)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Bernd | last2 = Brown | first2 = Rupert | year = 1987 | title = Perceived intragroup homogeneity in minority-majority contexts | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 703–711 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the same tradition it was also hypothesised that an ingroup homogeneity effect would emerge on ingroup defining dimensions for both minority and majority group members. This too was empirically supported.&lt;ref name="Simon (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal | pages = 1–30 |doi=10.1080/14792779243000005|title=The Perception of Ingroup and Outgroup Homogeneity: Reintroducing the Intergroup Context|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|volume=3|year=1992|last1=Simon|first1=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research also has reaffirmed that this effect of in-group homogeneity on in-group defining dimensions and out-group homogeneity on out-group defining dimensions may occur because people use their ratings of perceived group variability to express the extent to which social groups possess specific characteristics.&lt;ref name="Rubin &amp; Badea (2007)"/&gt; Like the self-categorization theory account, this recent research also suggests that the effect may occur ''independent'' of the motivational concerns described in social identity theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = The central tendency of a social group can affect ratings of its intragroup variability in the absence of social identity concerns | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 410–415 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2010.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overexcitability''' is a term introduced to current psychology by [[Kazimierz Dąbrowski|Kazimirz Dabrowski]] as part of his [[Positive disintegration|theory of positive disintegration]] (TPD). Overexcitability is the translation of a Polish word 'nadpobudliwosc', which means 'superstimulatability' in English.

In his book ''Positive Disintegration'',&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowski, Kazimierz M.D. Positive Disintegration. J.&amp; A. Churchill Ltd. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Dabrowski uses the terms "hyperexcitability", "increased excitability" "overexcitability" and just "excitability". He uses these terms interchangeably with nervousness.

Dabrowski introduces these terms to describe a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. He describes those who have hyperexcitability as showing "strength and perseveration of reactions incommensurate to their stimuli." Piechowski&lt;ref&gt;Michael Piechowski was a psychologist who did a lot of research using the theories of Dabrowski&lt;/ref&gt; noted that Dabrowski used the term psychic overexcitability to "underline the enhancement and intensification of mental activity much beyond the ordinary".&lt;ref&gt;(p287, p98)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike some other theories of development such as [[Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels, which are not tied to ages.

== Five forms ==
There are five forms of overexcitability.  These five forms are psychomotor, sensual, emotional, imaginational and intellectual.

'''Psychomotor''': OE is a heightened excitability of the neuromuscular system. This manifests itself in a capacity for being active and energetic, a love of movement, a surplus of energy and an actual need for physical action.

'''Sensual''': OE is an intensified experience of any type of sensual pleasure or displeasure emanating from one of the five senses, i.e. sight, [[olfaction|smell]], [[touch]], [[taste]], and [[hearing]]. It manifests as an increased appreciation of aesthetic pleasure such as [[music]], [[language]], and [[art]], and delight from tastes, smells, textures, sounds, and sights. Conversely, we see extreme pain and disgust when exposed to sensations perceived as unpleasant.

'''Intellectual''': OE manifests itself as an extreme desire to seek understanding and truth, to gain [[knowledge]], and to analyse and categorise information.  Those high in Intellectual OE are commonly seen as intellectually gifted and have incredibly active minds. They are intensely [[Curiosity|curious]], avid [[Reading (process)|readers]] and keen observers. They frequently love thinking purely for the sake of thinking.

'''Imaginational''': OE manifests as an intensified play of the imagination causing rich association of images, [[invention]], fantasy, use of image and [[metaphor]] and elaborate dreams and visions. Often children high in Imaginational OE do not differentiate between truth and fiction, or are absorbed in their own private world with imaginary companions and dramatizations. 

'''Emotional''': OE is characterised by heightened, intense [[feeling]]s, extreme experience of complex emotions, identification with others' feelings to the point of actual experience and strong sentimental expression. Other indications include physical response to emotional stimuli such as stomachaches when nervous and obsessive concern with death and depression. Emotionally overexcitable people have a strong capacity for deep relationships; they show strong emotional attachments to people, places, and things. They are empathetic, compassionate and extremely sensitive.

According to Dabrowski, a person who manifests any given form of overexcitability and especially one who manifests several forms of overexcitability, sees reality in a different, stronger and more multisided manner.&lt;ref&gt;(Dabrowski, 1972, p7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Giftedness ==
A small amount of definitive research has led to the belief that intensity, sensitivity and overexcitability are primary characteristics of the [http://sengifted.org/overexcitability-and-the-gifted/ highly gifted.] [[Positive disintegration|The association between OE and giftedness]] appears to be borne out in the research.&lt;ref&gt;(Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. Dąbrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth. The term "overexcitability" was popularized in the gifted education community by scholars such as Sal Mendaglio, who edited Dabrowski's ''Theory of Positive Disintegration'' and Susan Daniels and Michael M. Piechowski, who edited ''Living with Intensity''.

'''[[Infrasound]]''' is sound at frequencies lower than the low frequency end of human hearing threshold at 20&amp;nbsp;Hz. It is known, however, that humans can perceive sounds below this frequency at very high pressure levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yeowart |first=N. S. |author2=M. J.

L. |author2=D. B. Quine |title=Infrasound detection by the homing pigeon: A behavioral audiogram |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1979 |volume=129 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1007/bf00679906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langbauer |first=W.

== Mammals ==

The production and perception of infrasound has been observed in multiple mammals, including whale, elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros. For most of these animals, observations are preliminary and their sensitivity to infrasound has not been quantified. If an animal produces a low frequency sound, and uses it in communication, it suggests the animal might also be sensitive to infrasound.

=== Elephants ===

Elephants are the terrestrial animal in which the production of infrasonic calls was first noted by M. Krishnan,&lt;ref name="Krishnan 1972"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krishnan |first=M |title=An Ecological Survey of the Larger Mammals of Peninsular India |year=1972 |journal=The Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |volume=69 |pages=26–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; later discovered by Katy Payne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Katy |title=Silent Thunder: In the presence of Elephants |year=1998 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of low frequency sounds to communicate over long distances may explain certain elephant behaviors that have previously puzzled observers. Elephant groups that are separated by several kilometers have been observed to travel in parallel or to change the direction simultaneously and move directly towards each other in order to meet.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langbauer |first=W. R. |author2=K. B. Payne |author3=R. A. Charif |author4=L. Rapaport |author5=F. Osborn |title=African elephants respond to distant playbacks of low-frequency conspecific calls |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |year=1991 |volume=157 |pages=35–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of [[estrus]] for females is asynchronous, lasts only for a few days, and occurs only every several years. Nevertheless, males, which usually wander apart from female groups, rapidly gather from many directions to compete for a receptive female.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt; Since infrasound can travel for very long distances, it has been suggested that calls in the infrasonic range might be important for long distance communication for such coordinated behaviors among separated elephants.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payne |first=K. B. |author2=W. R. Langbauer |author3=E. M. Thomas |title=Infrasonic calls of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus |journal=Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |year=1986 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=297–301 |doi=10.1007/bf00300007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Infrasound production and perception ====

Recordings and playback experiments support that elephants use the infrasonic components of their calls for communication. Infrasonic vocalizations have been recorded from captive elephants in many different situations. The structure of the calls varies greatly but most of them range in frequency from 14 to 24&amp;nbsp;Hz, with durations of 10–15 seconds. When the nearest elephant is 5 m from the microphone, the recorded sound pressure levels can be 85 to 90&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986" /&gt; Some of these calls are completely inaudible to humans, while others have audible components that are probably due to higher frequency [[harmonics]] of below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz fundamentals.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986" /&gt; Sometimes, vocalizations cause perceptible rumbles that are accompanied by a fluttering of the skin on the calling elephant’s forehead where the nasal passage enters the skull. This fluttering can also occur without causing any perceptible sound, suggesting the production of a purely infrasonic call.&lt;ref name="Payne et al 1986" /&gt; The mechanism of infrasonic call production in elephants has not been determined.

Playback experiments using prerecorded elephant vocalizations show that elephants can perceive infrasound and how they respond to these stimuli. In playback experiments, certain behaviors that occur commonly after vocalizations are scored before and after a call is played. These behaviors include lifting and stiffening of ears, vocalization, walking or running towards the concealed speaker, clustering in a tight group, and remaining motionless ("freezing"), with occasional scanning movements of the head.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt; The occurrence of such behaviors consistently increases after the playing of a call, whether it is a full-bandwidth playback or a playback in which most of the energy above 25&amp;nbsp;Hz was filtered out. This filtering shows that the behaviorally significant information of the call is contained in the infrasonic range, and it also simulates the effect of frequency-dependent attenuation over distance as it might occur in the wild.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt; Behavioral responses do not increase for pure tone stimuli that are similar to recorded infrasonic calls in frequency and intensity. This shows that the responses are specifically to signals that were meaningful to the elephants.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt;

The use of prerecorded playbacks and behavioral scoring also shows that the infrasonic elephant calls are behaviorally significant over long distances. The degree of response behaviors performed by an elephant group, such as lifting of ears, walking towards the speakers, “freezing”, or scanning movements, was compared visually before and after the presentation of a stimulus, scoring a trial as a positive response if the amount of behaviors is greater after the stimulus. In one particular experiment performed on elephants living in the wild, the presentation of playbacks for 20–40 seconds from loudspeakers at distances of 1.2&amp;nbsp;km and 2&amp;nbsp;km caused a significant increase in response behaviors.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt; Since the playbacks were done at half the amplitude at which they were recorded, it is estimated that these calls would be perceptible by elephants at distances of at least 4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt; Even this may be an underestimate because animals do not respond every time they perceive a conspecific call, and they are probably less likely to respond to calls from further distances even if they do perceive them.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt;

There are some confounding factors that might influence the results of this kind of experiment. Firstly, the animals might actually be more sensitive than the experiments would indicate owing to [[habituation]] of the animals to the playback stimuli after several trial repetitions. To avoid this, researchers present several different types of playbacks in random order. Another problem that might arise in interpreting field experiments done on groups of animals is that animals may be responding to signals from other elephants in the group rather than the playback stimulus. However, an assumption is made that at least one animal in the group did perceive and respond directly to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langbauer et al 1991" /&gt;

==== Infrasound sensitivity ====

The auditory sensitivity thresholds have been measured behaviorally for one individual young female Indian elephant. The [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] test for sensitivity requires the elephant to respond to a stimulus by pressing a button with its trunk, which results in a sugar water reward if the elephant correctly identified the appropriate stimulus occurrence.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heffner |first=H. |author2=R. Heffner |title=Hearing in the elephant (Elephas maximus) |journal=Science |year=1980 |volume=208 |pages=518–520 |doi=10.1126/science.7367876 |pmid=7367876 |issue=4443 |bibcode=1980Sci...208..518H}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine auditory sensitivity thresholds, a certain frequency of sound is presented at various intensities to see at which intensity the stimulus ceases to evoke a response. The auditory sensitivity curve of this particular elephant began at 16&amp;nbsp;Hz with a threshold of 65&amp;nbsp;dB. A shallow slope decreased to the best response at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz with a threshold of 8&amp;nbsp;dB, followed by a steep threshold increase above 4&amp;nbsp;kHz. According to the 60&amp;nbsp;dB cut-off, the upper limit was 10.5&amp;nbsp;kHz with absolutely no detectable response at 14&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; The upper limit for humans is considered to be 18&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper and lower limits of elephant hearing are the lowest measured for any animals aside from the pigeon.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; By contrast, the average best frequency for animal hearing is 9.8&amp;nbsp;kHz, the average upper limit is 55&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt;

The ability to differentiate frequencies of two successive tones was also tested for this elephant using a similar conditioning paradigm. The elephant’s responses were somewhat erratic, which is typical for mammals in this test.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; Nevertheless, the ability to discriminate sounds was best at frequencies below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz particularly at measurements of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz and 250&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt;

Tests of the ability to localize sounds also showed the significance of low frequency sound perception in elephants. Localization was tested by observing the successful orienting towards the left or the right source loudspeakers when they were positioned at different angles from the elephant’s head. The elephant could localize sounds best at a frequency below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, with perfect identification of the left or right speaker at angles of 20 degrees or more, and chance level discriminations below 2 degrees.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; Sound localization ability was measured to be best at 125&amp;nbsp;Hz and 250&amp;nbsp;Hz, intermediate at 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, and very poor at frequencies at 4&amp;nbsp;kHz and above.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; A possible reason for this is that elephants are very good at using [[interaural phase differences]] which are effective for localizing low frequency sounds, but not as good at using [[interaural intensity difference]]s which are better for higher frequency sounds. Because of the elephant head size and the large distance between their ears, interaural difference cues become confused when wavelengths are shorter, explaining why sound localization was very poor at frequencies above 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt; It was observed that the elephant spread the pinna of its ears only during the sound localization tasks, however the precise effect of this behavior is unknown.&lt;ref name="Heffner &amp; Heffner 1980" /&gt;

== Birds ==

Although birds do not produce vocalizations in the infrasonic range, reactions to infrasonic stimuli have been observed in several species, such as the homing pigeon, the guinea fowl, and the Asian grouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yodlowski |first=M.

=== Pigeons ===

Infrasound perception has been observed and quantified in the homing pigeon which has particularly good long distance navigation skills. The precise relevance of such signals for the pigeon is still unknown, but several uses for infrasound have been hypothesized, such as navigation and detection of air turbulences when flying and landing.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=D. R. |title=The physiology and geophysics of bird navigation |journal=Q Rev Biol |year=1969 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=255–276 |doi=10.1086/406142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schermuly |first=L. |author2=R.

==== Infrasound sensitivity ====

In experiments using heart-rate conditioning, Pigeons have been found to be able to detect sounds in the infrasonic range at frequencies as low as 0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz. For frequencies below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, the pigeon threshold is at about 55&amp;nbsp;dB which is at least 50&amp;nbsp;dB more sensitive than humans.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt; Pigeons are able to discriminate small frequency differences in sounds at between 1&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz, with sensitivity ranging from a 1% shift at 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to a 7% shift at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt; Sensitivities are measured through a heart-rate conditioning test. In this test, an anesthetized bird is presented with a single sound or a sequence of sounds, followed by an electric shock. The bird’s heart-rate will increase in anticipation of a shock. Therefore, a measure of the heart-rate can determine whether the bird is able to distinguish between stimuli that would be followed by a shock from stimuli that would not.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delius |first=J. D. |author2=R. M. Tarpy |title=Stimulus control of heart rate by auditory frequency and auditory pattern in pigeons |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |year=1974 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=297–306 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1974.21-297 |pmid=4815397 |pmc=1333197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods have also been used to determine the pigeon’s sensitivity to barometric pressure changes, polarized light, and UV light.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt; These experiments were conducted in sound isolation chambers to avoid the influence of ambient noise. Infrasonic stimuli are hard to produce and are often transmitted through a filter that attenuates higher frequency components. Also, the tone burst stimuli used in these experiments were presented with stimulus onset and offsets ramped on and off gradually in order to prevent initial turn-on and turn-off transients.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt;

In order to use infrasound for navigation, it is necessary to be able to localize the source of the sounds. The known mechanisms for sound localizations make use of the time difference cues at the two ears. However, infrasound has such long wavelengths that these mechanisms would not be effective for an animal the size of a pigeon. An alternative method that has been hypothesized is through the use of the [[Doppler shift]].&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt; A Doppler shift occurs when there is relative motion between a sound source and a perceiver and slightly shifts the perceived frequency of the sound. When a flying bird is changing direction, the amplitude of the Doppler shift between it and an infrasonic source would change, enabling the bird to locate the source. This kind of mechanism would require the ability to detect very small changes in frequency. A pigeon typically flies at 20&amp;nbsp;km/hr, so a turn could cause up to a 12% modulation of an infrasonic stimulus. According to response measurements, pigeons are able to distinguish frequency changes of 1-7% in the infrasonic range, showing that the use of Doppler shifts for infrasound localization may be within the pigeon’s perceptive capabilities.&lt;ref name="Quine 1981" /&gt;

In early experiments with infrasound sensitivity in pigeons, surgical removal of the calumella, a bone that links the [[tympanic membrane]] to the [[inner ear]], in each ear severely reduced the ability to respond to infrasound, increasing the sensitivity threshold by about 50&amp;nbsp;dB. Complete surgical removal of the entire [[cochlea]], lagena, and calumellae completely abolishes any response to infrasound.&lt;ref name="Kreithen &amp; Quine 1979" /&gt; This shows that the receptors for infrasonic stimuli may be located in the inner ear.

==== Infrasound sensitive nerve fibers ====

Neural fibers that are sensitive to infrasonic stimuli have been identified in the pigeon and their characteristics have been studied. It turns out that, although these fibers also originate in the inner ear, they are quite different from normal acoustic fibers. 
Infrasound sensitive fibers have very high rates of spontaneous discharge, with a mean of 115imp/s, which is much higher than the spontaneous discharge of other auditory fibers.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Recordings show that discharge rates do not increase in response to infrasound stimuli but are modulated at levels comparable to the behavioral thresholds.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Modulation depth is dependent on stimulus frequency and intensity. The modulation is phase locked so that the discharge rate increases during one phase of the stimulus and decreases during the other, leaving the mean discharge rate constant.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Such pulse-frequency modulation allows the stimulus analysis to be independent of the peripheral tuning of the [[basilar membrane]] or the [[hair cells]], which is already poor at low auditory frequencies.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt; Unlike other acoustic fibers, infrasonic fibers do not show any indication of being tuned to a particular characteristic frequency.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990a" /&gt;

By injecting fibers that were identified to be sensitive to infrasound with HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase), the location and morphology of the stained fibers can be observed in sections under a microscope. Infrasound sensitive fibers are found to be simple bipolar cells in the [[auditory ganglion]] with a diameter of 1.6-2.2&amp;nbsp;µm at the axon and 0.9-1.2&amp;nbsp;µm at the dendrites.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schermuly |first=L. |author2=R. Klinke |title=Origin of infrasound sensitive neurones in the papilla basilaris of the pigeon: an HRP study |journal=Hearing Research |year=1990 |volume=48 |pages=69–78 |doi=10.1016/0378-5955(90)90199-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originate in the apical end of the cochlea and they are located near fibers that transmit low frequency sounds in the acoustic range. Unlike the ordinary acoustic fibers which terminate on the neural limbus, the infrasonic ones terminate on cells on the free basilar membrane.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b" /&gt; Furthermore, infrasonic fibers terminate on 2-9 hair cells while normal acoustic fibers connect to only one.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b" /&gt; Such characteristics would make these fibers analogous to fibers connecting to the outer hair cells in mammals, except that mammalian outer hair cells are known to have efferent fibers only and no afferents.&lt;ref name="Schermuly 1990b" /&gt; These observations suggest that the infrasound sensitive fibers are in a class separate from ordinary acoustic fibers.

[[File:RBG color wheel.svg|right|300px|thumb|RYB color star]]
Within the '''philosophy of color''', there is a dispute between '''color realism''', the view that colors are [[physical properties]] that objects possess, and '''color fictionalism''', a species of [[error theory]] viewing colors according to which there are no such physical properties that objects possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/colour/concrete_dirigible/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gatzia-Colour-Fictionalism-2010.pdf|title=Colour Fictionalism – SFU|author=|date=|website=sfu.ca|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of color==
One of the topics in the philosophy of color is the problem of the ontology of color. The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind of properties colors are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation of colors, and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/color/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Barry|last=Maund|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the ontology of color, there are various competing types of theories. One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties (properties of a special kind that can't be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such). This divides color primitivism from color reductionism. A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as unreducible properties. A reductionism is the opposite view, that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties. Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object's disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself (this sort of view is often dubbed "relationalism", since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers, but it also often called simply dispositionalism - various forms of course exist). An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen.

Another type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects. Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces (though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too). Byrne, Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view. They identify colors with reflectance types.

A reflectance type is a set, or type, of reflectances, and a reflectance is a surface's disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum.

Both relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories, since apart from specifying what colors are, they maintain that colored things exist.

Primitivism may be either realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims that colors aren't reducible to anything else. Some primitivists further accept that, though colors are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we are victims of color illusions. For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory.

==Color discourse==
If color fictionalism is true, and the world has no colors, should one just stop color discourse, and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other? ''Prescriptive color fictionalism'' would say no.  In ''prescriptive color fictionalism'',  while color discourse is, strictly speaking, false, one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist.

Color vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like [[Leo Hurvich]] that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the 1980s. An important work on the subject was C. L. Hardin's 'Color for Philosophers,' which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world, but are instead purely mental features.

David Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision. Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world. Nigel J.T. Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument. The psychologist George Boeree, in the tradition of J. J. Gibson, specifically assigns color to light, and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience, an approach he refers to as "quality realism".

Jonathan Cohen of UCSD and Michael Tye of University of Texas have also written many essays on color vision. Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto. In The Red and the Real, Cohen argues for the position, with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics. Cohen's work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin.

Michael Tye argues, among other things, that there is only one correct way to see colors. Therefore, the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of "normal" humans. Similarly, creatures with more advanced color vision, although better able to distinguish objects than people, are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans. Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called ''True Blue''.

Paul Churchland of UCSD has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism. In the 1980s Paul Churchland's view located colors in the retina. But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream. Paul Churchland's view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert's view, but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks.

Many philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism, the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world. Surprisingly, most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism (a.k.a. irrealism).

Jonathan Cohen of UCSD has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science, ''Color Ontology and Color Science''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[category theory]], a '''pseudo-abelian category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[preadditive category|preadditive]] and is such that every [[idempotent]] has a [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Artin, 1972, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that an idempotent morphism &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an endomorphism of an object with the property that &lt;math&gt;p\circ p = p&lt;/math&gt;. Elementary considerations show that every idempotent then has a cokernel.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Brünjes, Forms of Fermat equations and their zeta functions, Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudo-abelian condition is stronger than preadditivity, but it is weaker than the requirement that every morphism have a kernel and cokernel, as is true for [[abelian categories]].

Synonyms in the literature for pseudo-abelian include '''pseudoabelian''' and '''Karoubian'''.

== Examples ==

Any [[abelian category]], in particular the category '''Ab''' of [[abelian groups]], is pseudo-abelian. Indeed, in an abelian category, ''every'' morphism has a kernel.

The category of associative [[rng (algebra)|rngs]] (not [[ring (mathematics)|rings]]!) together with multiplicative morphisms is pseudo-abelian.

A more complicated example is the category of [[Chow motives]]. The construction of Chow motives uses the pseudo-abelian completion described below.

== Pseudo-abelian completion ==

The [[Karoubi envelope]] construction associates to an arbitrary category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; a category &lt;math&gt;kar(C)&lt;/math&gt; together with a functor
:&lt;math&gt;s:C\rightarrow kar(C)&lt;/math&gt;
such that the image &lt;math&gt;s(p)&lt;/math&gt; of every idempotent &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; splits in &lt;math&gt;kar(C)&lt;/math&gt;.
When applied to a [[preadditive category]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the Karoubi envelope construction yields a pseudo-abelian category &lt;math&gt;kar(C)&lt;/math&gt;
called the pseudo-abelian completion of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the functor
:&lt;math&gt;C\rightarrow kar(C)&lt;/math&gt;
is in fact an additive morphism.

To be precise, given a preadditive category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; we construct a pseudo-abelian category &lt;math&gt;kar(C)&lt;/math&gt; in the following way. The objects of &lt;math&gt;kar(C)&lt;/math&gt; are pairs &lt;math&gt;(X,p)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an idempotent of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,p)\rightarrow (Y,q)&lt;/math&gt;
in &lt;math&gt;kar(C)&lt;/math&gt; are those morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;f=q\circ f = f \circ p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.
The functor
:&lt;math&gt;C\rightarrow kar(C)&lt;/math&gt;
is given by taking &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(X,id_X)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10096">'''Reverse logistics''' is for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials. It is "the process of moving [[good (economics)|goods]] from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal. [[Remanufacturing]] and [[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbishing]] activities also may be included in the definition of reverse logistics."&lt;ref&gt;Hawks, Karen. [http://www.rlmagazine.com/edition01p12.php "What is Reverse Logistics?"], ''Reverse Logistics Magazine'', Winter/Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing green concerns and advancement of green supply chain management concepts and practices make it all the more relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, Samir K. "Network Design for Reverse Logistics", ''Omega'', '''2008''', 36(4), 535-548.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of publications on the topic of reverse logistics have increased significantly over the past two decades.  The first use of the term "reverse logistics" in a publication was by James R. Stock in a White Paper titled "Reverse Logistics," published by the Council of Logistics Management in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stock, Reverse Logistics (Oak Brook, IL:  Council of Logistics Management, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further refined in subsequent publications by Stock (1998) in another Council of Logistics Management book, titled Development and Implementation of Reverse Logistics Programs,&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stock, Development and Implementation of Reverse Logistics Programs (Oak Brook, IL:  Council of Logistics Management, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Rogers and Tibben-Lembke (1999) in a book published by the Reverse Logistics Association titled Going Backwards:  Reverse Logistics Trends and Practices.&lt;ref&gt;Dale S. Rogers and Ronald S. Tibben-Lembke, Going Backwards:  Reverse Logistics Trends and Practices (Reno, NV:  Reverse Logistics Executive Council, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  The reverse logistics process includes the management and the sale of surplus as well as returned equipment and machines from the hardware leasing business. Normally, [[logistics]] deal with events that bring the product towards the customer. In the case of reverse logistics, the resource goes at least one step back in the [[supply chain]]. For instance, goods move from the customer to the distributor or to the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Rengel, P. &amp; Seydl, C. (May 2002). [http://www.seydl.eu/en/papers/Rengel_Seydl_Reverse_Logistics_2002_23_05_en.pdf Completing the Supply Chain Model] at seydl.edu. Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a manufacturer's product normally moves through the [[supply chain network]], it is to reach the distributor or customer. Any process or management after the delivery of the product involves reverse logistics. If the product is defective, the customer would return the product. The manufacturing firm would then have to organise shipping of the defective product, testing the product, dismantling, repairing, recycling or disposing the product. The product would travel in reverse through the supply chain network in order to retain any use from the defective product. The logistics for such matters is reverse logistics.

==Business implications==
In today's marketplace, many retailers treat merchandise returns as individual, disjointed transactions. "The challenge for retailers and vendors is to process returns at a proficiency level that allows quick, efficient and cost-effective collection and return of merchandise. Customer requirements facilitate demand for a high standard of service that includes accuracy and timeliness. It’s the logistic company's responsibility to shorten the link from return origination to the time of resell."&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Ryan. [http://www.rlmagazine.com/edition01p14.php "Reverse Logistics: Customer Satisfaction, Environment Key to Success in the 21st Century"], ''Reverse Logistics Magazine''. Winter/Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By following returns management best practices, retailers can achieve a returns process that addresses both the operational and customer retention issues associated with merchandise returns.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Further, because of the connection between reverse logistics and customer retention, it has become a key component within Service Lifecycle Management (SLM), a [[business strategy]] aimed at retaining customers by bundling even more coordination of a company's services data together to achieve greater efficiency in its operations.

Reverse logistics is more than just returns management, it is "activities related to returns avoidance, gatekeeping, disposal and all other [[Aftermarket (automotive)|after-market]] supply chain issues".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Returns management—increasingly being recognized as affecting competitive positioning—provides an important link between marketing and logistics. The broad nature of its cross-functional impact suggests that firms would benefit by improving internal integration efforts. In particular, a firm's ability to react to and plan for the influence of external factors on the returns management process is improved by such internal integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.dea.univr.it/jsp/visualizzaAllegato.jsp?id=26331&amp;mime=application%2Fpdf&amp;filename=Russo+Supply+chain+strategy+IJPDLM.pdf&amp;localname=allegatooa_26331.pdf|title=The returns management process in supply chain strategy | last1= Mollenkopf |first1= D.| last2= Russo |first2= I. |first3= R. |last3= Frankel |journal=International Journal Physical Distribution Logistics Management |volume= 37 |issue= 7 |year= 2007 |pages= 568–92 |accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a firm's planning for returns, a primary factor is the remaining value of the material returning and how to recover that value.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, Samir K. "Value Recovery Network Design for Product Returns", ''International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management'', '''2008''', 38(4), 311-331.&lt;/ref&gt; "Returned goods, or elements of the product, could even be returned to suppliers and supply chain partners for them to re-manufacture".&lt;ref&gt;Madaan, J. &amp; Wadhwa, S. (2007) ''Flexible Process Planning Approaches for Sustainable Decisions in Reverse Logistics System'', Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management. Vol. 8, No. 4. p. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Third-party logistics]] providers see that up to 7% of an enterprise's gross sales are captured by return costs. Almost all reverse logistics contracts are customized to fit the size and type of company contracting. The [[Third-party_logistics|3PL]]'s themselves realize 12% to 15% profits on this business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/11/02/returns-reverse-logistics-market-cx_rm_1103returns.html | first= Robert | last= Malone |title= Reverse side of logistics: The business of returns |work=Forbes |date=3 November 2005 | accessdate= 2008-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Studies have shown that an average of 4% to 6% of all retail purchases are returned, costing the industry about $40 billion per year." &lt;ref&gt;Van Riper, Tom. [https://archive.is/20130102150110/http://www.forbes.com/2005/12/06/retailing-wal-mart-cx_tvr_1207reselling.html "Reseller Sees Many Happy Returns"], ''Forbes'', December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse logistics research has also found that 84.6 percent of companies in the United States use secondary market and 70 percent see the secondary market as a "competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reverse Logistics Sustainability Council |url=http://www.reverselogistics.com/ "Secondary Market Research" |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of unsold goods==
In certain industries, goods are distributed to downstream members in the supply chain with the understanding that the goods may be returned for credit if they are not sold e.g., newspapers and magazines. This acts as an incentive for downstream members to carry more stock, because the risk of obsolescence is borne by the upstream supply chain members. However, there is also a distinct risk attached to this logistics concept. The downstream member in the supply chain might exploit the situation by ordering more stock than is required and returning large volumes. In this way, the downstream partner is able to offer high level of service without carrying the risks associated with large inventories. The supplier effectively finances the inventory for the downstream member. It is therefore important to analyze customers’ accounts for hidden costs.

==Reusable packaging==
[[File:Woda.mineralna.w.skrzynkach.jpg|thumb|upright|Reusable [[mineral water]] bottles in crates]]
[[Reusable packaging]] systems require a [[Circular economy|closed-loop]] logistics system.  Examples include reusable [[pallet]]s, [[Bulk_box|bulk boxes]] such as [[Euro container]]s, [[reuse of bottles|Reusable bottles]] for milk, soda, and  beer, compressed gas cylinders, beer kegs, etc.

==Refusal of the products in the cash on delivery (COD)==
In case of [[e-commerce]] business, many websites offer the flexibility of [[cash on delivery]] (COD) to their customers. Sometimes customers refuse the product at the time of delivery, as there is no commitment to take the product. Then the logistics service provider follows the process of reverse logistics on the refused cargo. It is also known as Return to Origin (RTO). In this process, the e-commerce company adds the refused cargo to its inventory stock again, after proper quality checks as per the company's rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Business Logistics &amp; Management - Theory and Practice |first1= J J |last1= Vogt| first2=W J |last2= Pienaar |first3=P W C |last3= de Wit | publisher= OXFORD |year= 2002 |page= 236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse Logistics for Demonstrations==
In case of the Demonstration of Products to the client as part of Pre-Sales process, The Demonstration equipment is sent to the Customer and has to be returned to maintain Revolving Inventory.

'''Robert Watts''' was an American artist best known for his work as a member of the international group of artists [[Fluxus]]. Born in [[Burlington, Iowa]] June 14, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/bio.html] Robert Watts on Fluxus Artpool&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_e.jsp?iartistid=5816 Cybermuse]&lt;/ref&gt; he became Professor of Art at Douglass College, [[Rutgers University]], New Jersey in 1953, a post he kept until 1984. In the 1950s, he was in close contact with other teachers at Rutgers including [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Geoffrey Hendricks]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. This has led some critics to claim that [[pop art]] and [[conceptual art]] began at Rutgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgsa.rutgers.edu/runy/runy03_nfc.html Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/__Off_Limits_257.html Corinne Robins]&lt;/ref&gt;

He organised the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'', May 1963 with [[George Brecht]], and was one of the main protagonists, along with [[George Maciunas]], in turning [[SoHo]], New York, into an artist's quarter. He died Friday September 2, 1988 of lung cancer in [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/obituaries/robert-watts-artist-and-fluxus-figure-dies-of-cancer-at-65.html New York Times Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also known as '''Bob Watts''' or '''Doctor Bob'''.

==Early life==
[[Image:WattsBlackEggs.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Black Eggs'', 1964, a piece included at the ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery. This piece is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington]]
After earning a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Louisville]], Watts served as an officer in the United States Navy aboard aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Friedman_e.html Flux Med Dr Bob]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts left the Navy and moved to New York in 1948, where he studied art at the [[Art Students League]] and later at [[Columbia University]] from where he gained a degree in the History of Art, majoring in pre-Columbian and non-Western Art.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;  After becoming Professor of Art at Douglass College, Rutgers University, 1953, he started to exhibit works in a proto-pop style. He participated in Pop Art shows such as ''New Forms, New Media'' exhibition in 1960 at Martha Jackson's Gallery; the ''Popular Image'' exhibition at the Washington Gallery of Art in 1963; and the 1964 ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery, which also featured [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref name="MailArt"&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mail Art John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting at [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli's]] Gallery in 1964, Watts turned his back on the gallery system, and concentrated instead on the [[anti-art]] of the emerging New York avant-garde centred around George Maciunas. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[His] work obviously related to that of the Pop artists that I had discovered a few years before...Watts' chromed objects closely related to [[Jasper Johns|Johns']] cast beer cans and flashlights, for instance. The 1964 exhibition also included Watts' sculpture of plaster cast loaves of bread on shelves. That work, in particular, I think of as one of his most important inventions. I'm also particularly fond of the chrome eggs and egg carton in my own collection which will appear in this [posthumous] show. The public will be surprised that an artist -so promising at such an early date- did not receive through the years the appreciation he deserved." Leo Castelli&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival===
[[Image:LanternEvent.jpg|240px|right|thumb|''Lantern Event; an aspect of Yam Festival'', 1962, a mail art piece by Robert Watts and George Brecht; the coloured paper scores are by Watts.]]
Watts met the artist and chemist [[George Brecht]] in 1957 after the latter saw an exhibition of Watts' work and sought his acquaintance;&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht; A Heterospective, Konig, 2005, p306&lt;/ref&gt; the two would meet for lunch every week, with Kaprow occasionally joining them, for a number of years to discuss art and to plan joint exhibitions. One of the most famous was the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'' (1962–3), which used mail-art to build expectations for a month-long series of happenings, performances and exhibitions at Rutgers, New York City and [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal's]] farm in [[New Jersey]]. Participating artists included [[Alison Knowles]], [[Ay-O]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[John Cage]], and [[Dick Higgins]]. The events ran parallel to George Maciunas' Fluxus Festivals in Europe (Sept 1962-early 1963) -which had already performed some of Watts' event scores in Düsseldorf- and the two events were officially joined when Maciunas published Brecht's event scores as [[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|''Water Yam'']], the first of the Flux boxes to be published. Watts' own flux collection, ''Robert Watts Events'' was published a year later and brought together many of the mail art event scores that had been used to publicise the Yam Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Miller_h.html Flux Med]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I consider Yam Lecture a chain of events arranged in such a way that the sequence is quite random, no performance exactly like any other, with changing performers, costumers, actions, sounds, words, images, and so on. The 'structure' is such that it is very flexible (nearly non-existent) and permits inclusion of anything one wished to do and any possible future changes. It is a loose and open thing. The audience puts it together the way it wishes or not at all."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Similar ideas were at work in Yam Festival which George Brecht and I carried out last year. In effect this was a mailing to an audience, sometimes randomly chosen, of an assortment of things. Some were event cards similar to the above; others were objects, food, pencils, soap, photos, actions, words, facts, statements, declarations, puzzles, etc. Certain ones were by subscription. One might say this way of working is a way or manner of calling attention to what one wishes to talk about; or it is a way of talking about it. Or it is a way to hold up for scrutiny a range of material that ordinarily is not so directly useful for art or has not yet been so considered." Robert Watts, quoted in the Times Literary Supplement, 1964&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One example of Watts' event scores around this point is ''Casual Event'';

===''Casual Event'' (1962)===
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive car to filling station&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;inflate right front tire&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;continue to inflate until tire blows out&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;change tire*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive home

&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;*if car is newer model drive home on blown out tire

According to [[Henry Flynt]], Maciunas '[begged] Watts not to continue 'Yam' separately from Fluxus. Maciunas was desperate to unite the whole post-Cage movement under his command.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mailart; Robert Watts by John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus===
[[Image:Wattstimekit.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A number of versions of the ''Flux Timekit'', 1967, by Robert Watts, collecting together objects that exist in different time scales.]]
Watts' friendship with Maciunas was cemented when the latter was confined to a hospital bed throughout May 1963. To cheer him up, Watts sent him ''Hospital Events'' (see [http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/moreinfo.cfm?title_id=3931&amp;return=/search/search.cfm&amp;qty=0&amp;type=1&amp;email=&amp;cookie1=D9E71EB4-1C42-ECEB-7880DA46C41B8750&amp;retail=100.0000&amp;qty=1&amp;page=3&amp;frompage=Search%20%3E%20%3CA%20HREF%3D%2Fcatalogue%2Fsearch%2Ecfm%3Femail%3D%26cookie1%3DD9E71EB4%2D1C42%2DECEB%2D7880DA46C41B8750%26search%3Dfluxus%2520box%26search%5Ftype%3D%3Efluxus%20box%3C%2FA%3E]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Hendricks_e.html Geoff Hendricks] retrieved 23–04–09&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas enjoyed the piece so much that he published it as an early ''Fluxbox''; many of Watts' contemporary event cards were subsequently included in ''Fluxus 1'', 1963, Maciunas' first year box compiling works by the members of the international avant-garde.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It must have been Alison Knowles who called me up to say [George Maciunas] was in bad shape with asthma in an Air Force hospital in Germany and needed help or at least some encouragement.... I decided to send something for entertainment, so I stuck some pistol caps on the back of old photos from an Italian magazine of WWI vintage. I remember there was a photo of a priest blessing a propeller of an Italian Air Force fighter plane. The idea was to put the photo on an anvil and hit the front with a hammer until all the caps exploded. Later GM said he got a big kick out of this procedure, especially since after he exploded all the caps, he set up the photos' remains for the locals to continue the destruction.... he said the people beat the shit out of those photos until there was nothing left but fuzz." Robert Watts, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p62&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the years Watts contributed a number of works to Fluxus including a ''Flux Atlas'', a collection of rocks from different countries, and a ''Flux Timekit'', a series of boxes that housed objects that existed in different time scales, such as seeds to be planted, a time-lapsed photo of a speeding bullet and a pocket watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Cold War Games and Postwar Art / Claudia Mesch] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=July 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up ''Implosions Inc.'' with Maciunas to mass-produce novelty items, and helped run the ''Flux Housing Co-Operative'', an artist-run scheme that is held responsible for the rehabilitation and gentrification of SoHo, offering cheap loft spaces to artists throughout the sixties and seventies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0532909/bio Imdb Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts himself was the first resident of the first working Flux Co-Op at 80 Wooster Street.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Mekas]]' cinematheque and Maciunas' apartment were housed in the same building which soon became the 'central Fluxus loft'.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p177&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the notorious ''Flux Mass'', and was one of the very few original artists apart from Maciunas himself to have neither distanced himself from the movement, nor to have been expelled.

==Posthumous Reputation==
Referred to as ''the invisible man of Fluxus and Pop'' by the critic Kim Levin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_3_88/ai_60130219/ Watts and Kaprow, Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt; a term later used as the title of a solo posthumous show in Kassel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/1994/lang/1 ArtFactsNet&lt;/ref&gt; Watts remains a 'distant, aloof, and enigmatic'&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt; figure. In general his reputation has gradually recovered since the late 90s, although not without comments on some of the works' perceived sexism.&lt;ref name="Richard"/&gt; As individual members of Fluxus have increasingly been singled out for re-appraisals, Watts work has been seen in a number of solo and small group shows across the USA and Europe.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'There is something impersonal or phlegmatic in Watts's composition, a deliberately flattened sense of timing. This aspect of his work has not aged as gracefully as have his concerns with commodity and its absurdities. A puckish wit remains where media and message are crisply meshed, as in Portrait Dress, 1965, a see-through vinyl frock with pockets for photographs, or the suite of neon signs in which the signatures of masters like Ingres, Duchamp, and Lichtenstein glow like ads. Other items in this show appeared dated, such as the Lucite sculptures with embedded photographs of food, or the painted plaster casts of bread lined up in a grayscale row, but this was largely because their semiotic jokesterism has been so wholly assimilated by successors that it cannot startle now as it did then.' Frances Richard, 2001&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_40/ai_79826078]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His work is held in numerous collections, including The [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=86231 Cloud Music]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris,  [[J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17696">The '''sectoral balances''' (also called '''sectoral financial balances''') are a [[sectoral analysis]] framework for macroeconomic analysis of national economies developed by British economist [[Wynne Godley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/goldmans-jan-hatzius-on-sectoral-balances-2012-12 Goldman's Top Economist Explains The World's Most Important Chart, And His Big Call For The US Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Sectoral Financial Balances in U.S. Economy.png|thumb|350px|right|Sectoral financial balances in U.S. economy 1990-2017. By definition, the three balances must net to zero.

The approach is used by scholars at the [[Levy Economics Institute]] to support macroeconomic modelling and by [[Modern Monetary Theory|Modern Monetary Theorists]] to illustrate the relationship between government budget deficits and private saving.&lt;ref name="fiebeger" /&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Sectoral balance - private sector components v1.png|thumb|right|350px|Private sector balance showing household and business components separately from 1990-2017. Ideally, households are net savers (surplus balance) while businesses are net borrowers/investors (deficit balance). However, since the early 2000s, businesses have shifted to surpluses in most years. Since the foreign sector has remained in surplus, the U.S. has offset this with higher budget deficits. The sum of the two components equaled 1.2% GDP in 2017, which matches the private balance in the graph showing the three sectors.&lt;ref name="NPI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=481267 FRED-Sectoral Balances Household and Business (Private Sector Detail)-Retrieved June 29, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the national economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by [[Identity (mathematics)|definition]]. A surplus balance represents a net savings or net financial asset building position, while a deficit balance represents a net borrowing or net financial asset reducing position. Each sector may be defined as follows, using the U.S. as an example:
*Private sector: A surplus balance means U.S. households and businesses together are net savers, building their financial asset position. In other words, savings by households exceed the amount borrowed and invested by businesses. The private sector had a roughly 1.2% GDP surplus in 2017. A deficit would mean households and businesses together are net borrowers, reducing their financial asset position. 
*Foreign sector or "rest of the world": A surplus balance means those outside the U.S. are net savers. This is consistent with a U.S. trade deficit, in which U.S. residents borrow savings from foreign residents to finance import purchases. Foreigners are building their net financial asset position by lending to the U.S. so it can purchase their imports. The U.S. had a trade deficit of roughly 2.3% GDP in 2017. A foreign sector deficit balance would mean foreign residents are net spenders and are borrowing from the U.S. private sector, which would be consistent with a U.S. trade surplus; this was not the 2017 situation.
*Government balance (all levels, e.g., federal, state and local in the U.S.): A surplus balance represents a government collecting more tax revenue than it pays in outlays, building its net financial asset position. This would mean the government is a net saver, removing funds from the private sector. A deficit balance means government outlays are greater than tax revenue and it is reducing its net financial asset position (i.e., increasing its debt position), providing funds to the private sector. Another interpretation is that a government surplus reduces private sector financial assets, while a government deficit increases private sector financial assets. The U.S. government at all levels ran a 3.5% GDP deficit in 2017.&lt;ref name="NPI"/&gt;

To summarize, in the U.S. in 2017, there was a private sector surplus of 1.2% GDP due to household savings exceeding business investment. There was also a trade deficit of 2.3% GDP, meaning the foreign sector was in surplus. By definition, there must therefore exist a government budget deficit of 3.5% GDP so all three net to zero. This is a relatively balanced position, but such is not always the case. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a foreign sector surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/19/the-balance-sheet-recession-in-the-us/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S.- July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressed as a formula, the sectoral balance identity is: (Savings - Investment) + (Imports - Exports) + (Tax Revenues - Outlays) = 0; or (S-I) + (M-X) + (T-G) =0, as described below.

==Recent interpretations==
[[File:Sectoral Balances Using CBO Data 1992-2017.png|thumb|right|400px|Sectoral balances using CBO data.  Their method defines the balances as: A) Federal budget balance; B) Current Account (multiplied by -1 in the diagram); and C) Nonfederal Domestic Balance, representing mainly private sector net savings and the state and local government sector balance. The equation A+B+C=0 must hold by definition.&lt;ref name="CBO_Aug2018"/&gt;]]
The U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]] discussed sectoral balances in its August 2018 economic outlook: "For example, the unique pattern of the balances in the early years of this century reflected increased borrowing by households and businesses that later proved to be unsustainable. Starting with the recession of 2001 and continuing through the expansion of the early- to mid-2000s, both the federal government and the U.S. domestic private sector were net borrowers. That borrowing was funded by foreign investors, and current-account
deficits climbed throughout the period, reaching an all-time high of 6.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal year 2006. Following the onset of the 2007–2009 recession, the private sector drastically cut its borrowing while the federal government’s borrowing dramatically increased." CBO also provided supplemental data used to calculate the three sectoral balances, which it defines as the federal budget balance, current account balance, and nonfederal domestic balance.&lt;ref name="CBO_Aug2018"&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54318 CBO-An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028-Retrieved November 12, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Wynne Godley]] explained in 2004-2005 how U.S. sector imbalances posed a significant risk to the U.S. and global economy. The combination of a high and growing foreign sector surplus and high government sector deficit meant that the private sector was moving towards a net borrowing position (from surplus to deficit) as a housing bubble developed, which he warned was an unsustainable combination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/imbalances-looking-for-a-policy Levy Economics Institute-Wynne Godley-Imbalances Looking for a Policy-April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/some-unpleasant-american-arithmetic Levy Economics Institute-Wynne Godley-Some Unpleasant American Arithmetic-June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Economist [[Martin Wolf]] cites as an example the U.S., where sudden shifts in the private sector from deficit to surplus due to the [[Great Recession]] forced the government balance into deficit.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com" /&gt; "The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust."&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"/&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: "This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/the-problem-2/ NYT-Paul Krugman-The Problem-December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists at the [[New Policy Institute]] explained in 2011 that: "In a healthy economy, businesses invest using money borrowed from households who are saving for future consumption. In the ideal world, this business sector deficit and household sector surplus are accompanied by net exports (a deficit for the rest of the world) and a small government deficit (to fund its own investment)."&lt;ref name="NPI"/&gt;

== Sectoral balances description ==
GDP ([[Gross Domestic Product]]) is the value of all goods and services sold within a country during one year. GDP measures flows rather than stocks (example: the [[public deficit]] is a flow, the [[government debt]] is a stock). Flows are derived from the National Accounting relationship between aggregate spending and income. Ergo:

(1) Y = C + I + G + (X – M)

where Y is GDP (expenditure), C is consumption spending, I is private investment spending, G is government spending, X is exports and M is imports (so X – M = net exports).

Another perspective on the national income accounting is to note that households can use total income (Y) for the following uses:

(2) Y = C + S + T

where S is total saving and T is total taxation (the other variables are as previously defined).

You then bring the two perspectives together (because they are both just “views” of Y) to write:

(3) C + S + T = Y = C + I + G + (X – M)

You can then drop the C (common on both sides) and you get:

(4) S + T = I + G + (X – M) 

Then you can convert this into the following sectoral balances accounting relations, which allow us to understand the influence of fiscal policy over private sector indebtedness. Hence, equation (4) can be rearranged to get the accounting identity for the three sectoral balances – private domestic, government budget and external:

*'''(S – I) = (G – T) + (X – M)''' or
*'''(S - I) + (M - X) + (T - G) = 0'''

The sectoral balances equation says that total private savings (S) minus private investment (I) has to equal the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T) plus net exports (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.

Another way of saying this is that total private savings (S) is equal to private investment (I) plus the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T) plus net exports (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.

All these relationships (equations) hold as a matter of accounting and not matters of opinion.

Thus, when an external deficit (X – M &amp;lt; 0) and public surplus (G - T &amp;lt; 0) coincide, there must be a private deficit. While private spending can persist for a time under these conditions using the net savings of the external sector, the private sector becomes increasingly indebted in the process.

==Usage==
In [[macroeconomics]], the [[Modern Money Theory]] uses sectoral balances to define any transactions between the government sector and the non-government sector as a [[Modern Monetary Theory#Vertical transactions|vertical transaction]].

The government sector is considered to include the treasury and the [[central bank]], whereas the non-government sector includes private individuals and firms (including the private banking system) and the external sector – that is, foreign buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name="def1011"&gt;[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=332 "Deficit Spending 101 - Part 1 : Vertical Transactions"] Bill Mitchell, 21 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In any given time period, the government’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. Sectoral balances analysis states that as a matter of accounting, it follows that [[government budget deficit]]s add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into private bank accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via taxes than it has put back in via spending.

Therefore, budget deficits, by definition, are equivalent to adding net financial assets to the private sector; whereas budget surpluses remove financial assets from the private sector.

This is represented by the identity:

'''(G – T) = (S – I) – NX'''

which is

'''(State sector balance) = (Private sector balance) – External sector balance'''

where G is government spending, T is taxes, S is savings, I is investment and NX is net exports.

The conclusion drawn from this is that private net saving is only possible when running a trade deficit if the government runs budget deficits; alternately, the private sector is forced to dis-save when the government runs a budget surplus and the trade deficit exists.

According to the sectoral balances framework, budget surpluses remove net savings; in a time of high effective demand, this may lead to a private sector reliance on credit to finance consumption patterns. Hence, continual budget deficits are necessary for a growing economy that wants to avoid deflation. Therefore, budget surpluses are required only when the economy has excessive [[aggregate demand]], and is in danger of inflation.

==Austerity in the view of the sectoral balances approach==
According to the sectoral balances approach, [[austerity]] can be counterproductive in a downturn due to a significant private-sector financial surplus, in which consumer savings is greater than business investment. In a healthy economy, the amount borrowed or invested by companies is greater than or equal to the private-sector savings placed into the banking system by consumers. However, if consumers have increased their savings but companies are not investing, a surplus develops in the banking system. Business investment is one of the major components of [[GDP]].

Economist [[Richard Koo]] described similar effects for several of the developed world economies in December 2011: "Today private sectors in the U.S., the U.K., Spain, and Ireland (but not Greece) are undergoing massive [[deleveraging]] [paying down debt rather than spending] in spite of record low interest rates. This means these countries are all in serious [[balance sheet recession|balance sheet recessions]]. The private sectors in Japan and Germany are not borrowing, either. With borrowers disappearing and banks reluctant to lend, it is no wonder that, after nearly three years of record low interest rates and massive liquidity injections, industrial economies are still doing so poorly. Flow of funds data for the U.S. show a massive shift away from borrowing to savings by the private sector since the housing bubble burst in 2007. The shift for the private sector as a whole represents over 9 percent of U.S. GDP at a time of zero interest rates. Moreover, this increase in private sector savings exceeds the increase in government borrowings (5.8 percent of GDP), which suggests that the government is not doing enough to offset private sector deleveraging."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf Richard Koo-The world in balance sheet recession-Real World Economics Review-December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)''' is a form of habituation therapy designed to help people who suffer from [[tinnitus]], a ringing, buzzing, hissing, or other sound in the ears when no external sound is present.  Two key components of TRT directly follow from the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. One of these principles includes [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|directive counseling]] aimed at reclassification of tinnitus to a category of neutral signals,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} while the other includes [[neurologic music therapy|sound therapy]]&lt;ref name=Jastreboff2&gt;Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Implementing the Neurophysiological Model, Jastreboff, P.J. and Hazell, J.W.P. (2004). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at weakening tinnitus related neuronal activity.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jastreboff|first=P.J.|title=Tinnitus retraining therapy|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=2007|volume=166|pages=415–423|issn=0079-6123|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612307660403|accessdate=23 March 2013|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)66040-3|series=&lt;!-- --&gt;|isbn=9780444531674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of TRT is management of tinnitus; there is no evidence that TRT can attenuate or eliminate tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The efficacy of TRT in reducing the distress of tinnitus has not been established.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} TRT is not a medical treatment for tinnitus or any other condition, and is not administered by a medical doctor or other medical professional.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An alternative to TRT is [[tinnitus masking]], the use of noise, music or other environmental sounds to obscure or mask the tinnitus.  Hearing aids can provide a partial masking effect for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler et.al.|first1=R.S.|title=Tinnitus Retraining Therapy: Mixingpoint and Masking are Equally Effective.|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=2012|volume=33|issue=5|pages=588–594|doi=10.1097/aud.0b013e31824f2a6e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a review of tinnitus retraining therapy trials indicate that it may be a more effective treatment than tinnitus masking.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John S|author2=Don McFerran |title=Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) for tinnitus|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2010|issue=3|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007330.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
Not everyone who experiences tinnitus is significantly bothered by it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, some of the problems caused by tinnitus include annoyance, anxiety, panic, and loss of sleep and/or concentration.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt; The distress of tinnitus is strongly associated with various psychological factors; loudness, duration and other characteristics of the tinnitus are secondary.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

TRT may offer real although moderate improvement in tinnitus suffering for adults with moderate-to-severe tinnitus, in the absence of hyperacusis, significant hearing loss and/or depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer, et.al.|first1=CA|title=Effect of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy on the Loudness and Annoyance of Tinnitus: A Controlled Trial.|journal=Ear &amp; Hearing|date=2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=145–55|doi=10.1097/aud.0b013e3181f5374f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone is a good candidate for TRT.  Factors associated with suitability for TRT and predisposing for favorable outcome are: lower loudness of tinnitus, higher pitch of tinnitus, shorter duration of tinnitus since onset, recognition of tinnitus attenuation by sound generator, lower hearing thresholds (i.e. better hearing), high Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman, et.al|first1=CW|title=Development of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory|journal=Arch Otolaryngol|date=1996|volume=122|issue=2|pages=143–148|doi=10.1001/archotol.1996.01890140029007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and positive attitude toward therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariizumi|first1=Y|title=Clinical prognostic factors for tinnitus retraining therapy with a sound generator  in tinnitus patients|journal=J Med Dent Sci|date=2010|volume=57|issue=1|pages=45–53|pmid=20437765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other secondary hearing symptoms===
Despite the fact that there haven't been any recent studies which concluded in its optimal treatment, tinnitus retraining therapy has been applied to treating [[hyperacusis]], [[misophonia]], and [[phonophobia]].&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

===Limitations===
There is no evidence that TRT or any other treatment can eliminate or decrease tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease. As such, the optimal treatment strategy should be directed toward eliminating the disease, rather than simply alleviating the symptom.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} More than half of people with tinnitus have a comorbid psychological injury or illness (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, stress, dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, etc.) that can exacerbate the tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Cause==

===Physiological basis===
It has been proposed that tinnitus is caused by mechanisms that generate abnormal neural activity, specifically one mechanism called discordant damage (dysfunction) of outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

===Psychological model===
{{See also|Neuroplasticity}}
The psychological basis for TRT stems from the fact that the brain exhibits a high level of plasticity. In turn, this allows it to adjust to any sensory signals as long as they do not lead to negative effects. TRT is imputed to work by interfering with the neural activity causing the tinnitus at its source, in order to prevent it from spreading to other nervous systems such as the limbic and autonomic nervous systems.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

==Methodologies==

===Classification===
Clients are classified into 5 categories. These categories are numbered 0 to 4, and based on whether or not the patient has tinnitus with hearing loss, tinnitus with no hearing loss, tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis, and tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis for an extended amount of time.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Counseling===
{{Further|Cognitive behavior therapy}}
The first component of TRT, directive counseling, may change the way tinnitus is perceived. The patient is taught the basic knowledge about the auditory system and its function, the mechanism of tinnitus generation and the annoyance associated with tinnitus. The repetition of these points in the follow-up visits helps the patient to perceive the signal as a non-danger.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Efficacy==
Measuring the efficacy of TRT is beset by confounding factors: tinnitus reporting is entirely subjective therefore not reliable; tinnitus or at least subjects' perception of it varies over time and repeated evaluations are not consistent. Researchers have noted that there is a large placebo component to tinnitus management.  In many commercial TRT practices, there is a large proportion of dropouts; reported 'success' ratios may not take these subjects into account.

There are few available studies, but most show that tinnitus naturally declines over time (years) in a large proportion of subjects surveyed, without any treatment. The annoyance of tinnitus also tends to decline over time.  In at least some, tinnitus spontaneously disappears.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff2/&gt;

A Cochrane review found only one sufficiently rigorous study of TRT and noted that while the study suggested benefit in the treatment of tinnitus, the study quality was not good enough to draw firm conclusions.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt; A separate Cochrane review of sound therapy (though they called it masking), an integral part of TRT, found no convincing evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in the treatment of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006371.pub3|chapter=Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adults|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2012|last1=Hobson|first1=Jonathan|last2=Chisholm|first2=Edward|last3=El Refaie|first3=Amr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary in The Lancet concluded that in the only decent study, TRT was more effective than masking; in another study in which TRT was used as a control methodology, TRT showed a small benefit.  A study which compared cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in combination with the counselling part of TRT versus standard care (ENT, audiologist, maskers, hearing aid) found that the specialized care had a positive effect on quality of life as well as specific tinnitus metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baguley|first1=D|title=Tinnitus|journal=The Lancet|date=2013|volume=382|issue=9904|pages=1600–07|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60142-7|pmid=23827090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical practice==
Tinnitus activities treatment (TAT) is a clinical adaptation of TRT that focuses on four areas: thoughts and emotions, hearing and communication, sleep, and concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler, et.al.|first1=RS|title=Tinnitus activities treatment|journal=Prog Brain Res.|date=2007|volume=166|pages=425–34|pmid=17956807|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)66041-5|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444531674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive tinnitus management (PTM) is a 5-step structured clinical protocol for management of tinnitus which may include tinnitus retraining therapy. The five steps are:
# triage – determining appropriate referral, i.e. audiology, ENT, emergency medical intervention, or mental health evaluation;
# audiologic evaluation of hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis and other symptoms;
# group education about causes and management of tinnitus;
# interdisciplinary evaluation of tinnitus;
# individual management of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry, et.al.|first1=J|title=Using Therapeutic Sound With Progressive Audiologic Tinnitus Management|journal=Trends Amplif.|date=2008|volume=12|issue=3|pages=188–209|doi=10.1177/1084713808321184|pmc=4134892|pmid=18664499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) now employs PTM to help patients self-manage their tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henry, et.al.|first1=J|title=VA Clinical Practice Recommendations for Tinnitus|url=http://www.ncrar.research.va.gov/Education/Documents/TinnitusDocuments/TinnitusPracticeGuidelines.pdf|website=National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
* Sound therapy for tinnitus may be more effective if the sound is patterned (i.e. varying in frequency or amplitude) rather than static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reavis, et.al.|first1=KM|title=Patterned sound therapy for the treatment of tinnitus. Hear Jour. 2010;60(11):21–24|journal=Hear jour.|date=2010|volume=60|issue=11|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For persons with severe or disabling tinnitus, techniques that are minimally surgical involving magnetic or electrical stimulation of areas of the brain involved in auditory processing may suppress tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridder, et.al.|first1=DD|title=Magnetic and electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex for intractable tinnitus|journal=J Neurosurg|date=2004|issue=100|doi=10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0560}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Notched music therapy, in which ordinary music is altered by a one octave notch filter centered at the tinnitus frequency, may reduce tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henning, et.al.|first1=S|title=Customized notched music training reduces tinnitus loudness|journal=Commun Integr Biol|date=2010|volume=3|issue=3|pages=274–277|pmid=20714412|pmc=2918775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Cognitive behavior therapy===
[[Cognitive behavior therapy]] (CBT), the counselling part of TRT, as a generalized type of psychological and behavioral counselling, has also been used by itself in the management of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyung, et.al.|first1=JJ|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus: Evidence and Efficacy|journal=Korean J Audiol|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=101–104|doi=10.7874/kja.2013.17.3.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearing aids===
If tinnitus is associated with hearing loss, a tuned hearing aid that amplifies sound in the frequency range of the hearing loss (usually the high frequencies) may effectively mask tinnitus by raising the level of environmental sound, in addition to the benefit of restoring hearing.

=== Masking ===
{{See also|Tinnitus masker}}
White noise generators or environmental music may be used to provide a background noise level that is of sufficient amplitude that it wholly or partially 'masks' the tinnitus (tinnitus masker).  Composite hearing aids that combine amplification and white noise
generation are also available.

===Other===
Numerous other non-TRT methods have been suggested for the treatment or management of tinnitus.
* pharmacological – No drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating tinnitus. However, various pharmacological treatments, including antidepressants, anxiolytics, vasodilators and vasoactive substances, and intravenous lidocaine have been prescribed for tinnitus
* lifestyle and support – Things like loud noise, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, quiet environments and psychological conditions like stress and depression may exacerbate tinnitus.  Reducing or controlling these may help manage the condition.
* alternative medicine – vitamin, antioxidant and herbal preparations (notably ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' extract, also called [[EGb761]]) are advertised as treatments or cures for tinnitus.  However, none are approved by the FDA, and controlled clinical trials on their efficacy are lacking.

'''Tithing settlement''' is the name of a formalized series of meetings held at [[Ward (LDS Church)|local congregations]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). During tithing settlement, each member of the church is individually interviewed by the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] or [[branch president]] of the congregation and asked to declare whether he or she has paid a full [[tithe]] to the church, which is defined as ten per cent of the member's income. Tithing settlement meetings are generally held in November or December.

During the meeting, each member is given a copy of his or her donation record for the year, and asked to confirm it is correct.

Each church member is required to choose one of the following tithing statuses as defined by the church:&lt;ref name="instructions"&gt;[https://www.lds.org/help/support/tithing-status?lang=eng], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Full-tithe''' payers have paid one-tenth of their income as tithing. ([[Missionary (LDS Church)|Full-time missionaries]] and those completely dependent on church welfare assistance are also full tithe-payers.)
* '''Part-tithe''' payers have paid tithing, but the amount is less than one-tenth of their income.
* '''Non-tithe''' payers have not paid tithing during the year and (in the view of the church) are not exempt from paying tithing.
* Previously, '''Exempt''' members had no income and paid no tithing, but they declare that they would have paid a full tithe if they had income. But it appears that this classification has been recently removed.

Church members are invited to make a payment to correct any deficiency before the records are closed for year-end.

If a church member declines to participate or attend a tithing settlement meeting, the bishop or branch president is required to choose a tithing status on their behalf.&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt;

Payment of tithing is a core doctrine of the church for all members, including children. Church members must declare themselves to be "full-tithe payers" in order to receive a [[temple recommend]] and attend one of the church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]. However, that is done in a separate meeting from the tithing settlement.&lt;ref name="Tithing Settlement"&gt;[https://tech.lds.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tithing_settlement Church Tithing Settlement Overview], lds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church uses the honor system and personal accountability of the individual tithe payer. It is not the church's general position to question the honesty of tithe payers. The church predominantly accepts the status declared by the tithe payer through counsel and consideration of the leaders. It is up to the individual tithe payer to determine and in turn declare to their leaders whether he or she feels they are a full tithe payer or not.

In [[model theory]], a '''transfer principle''' states that all statements of some language that are true for some structure are true for another structure. One of the first examples was [[algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#The Lefschetz principle|the Lefschetz principle]], which states that any sentence in the [[first-order logic|first-order language]] of [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] that is true for the [[complex number]]s is also true for any [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic (algebra) |characteristic 0]].

==History==
An incipient form of a transfer principle was described by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] under the name of "the [[Law of Continuity]]".&lt;ref name="Keisler2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keisler|first1=H. Jerome|title=Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach|url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html|page=902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here [[infinitesimal]]s are expected to have the "same" properties as [[appreciable number]]s.  Similar tendencies are found in [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], who used infinitesimals to define both the [[continuous function|continuity of functions]] (in [[Cours d'Analyse]]) and a form of the [[Dirac delta function]].&lt;ref name="Keisler2000"/&gt;{{rp|903}}

In 1955, [[Jerzy Łoś]] proved the transfer principle for any [[hyperreal number]] system.  Its most common use is in  [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]] of the [[hyperreal number]]s, where the transfer principle  states that any sentence expressible in a certain formal language that is true of [[real number]]s is also true of hyperreal numbers.

==Transfer principle for the hyperreals==
The transfer principle concerns the logical relation between the properties of the real numbers R, and the properties of a  larger field denoted *R called the [[hyperreal number]]s.  The field *R includes, in particular, infinitesimal ("infinitely small") numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical realisation of a project initiated by Leibniz.

The idea is to express  analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well to *R.  This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level, the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to [[internal set]]s rather than to all sets. As [[Abraham Robinson|Robinson]] put it, ''the sentences of [the theory] are interpreted in *R in [[Leon Henkin|Henkin]]'s sense.''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, A. The metaphysics of the calculus, in Problems in the Philosophy of Mathematics, ed. Lakatos (Amsterdam: North Holland), pp. 28–46, 1967. Reprinted in the 1979 Collected Works. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem to the effect that each proposition valid over R, is also valid over *R, is called the transfer principle.

There are several different versions of the transfer principle, depending on what model of non-standard mathematics is being used. 
In terms of model theory, the transfer principle states that a map from a standard model to a non-standard model is an [[elementary equivalence|elementary embedding]] (an embedding preserving the [[truth value]]s of all statements in a language), or sometimes a ''bounded'' elementary embedding (similar, but only for statements with bounded quantifiers).

The transfer principle appears to lead to contradictions if it is not handled correctly.
For example, since the hyperreal numbers form a non-[[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] [[ordered field]] and the reals form an Archimedean ordered field, the property of being Archimedean ("every positive real is larger than 1/''n'' for some positive integer ''n''") seems at first sight not to satisfy the transfer principle. The statement "every positive hyperreal is larger than 1/''n'' for some positive integer ''n''" is false; however
the correct interpretation is "every positive hyperreal is larger than 1/''n'' for some positive [[hyperinteger]] ''n''". In other words, the hyperreals appear to be Archimedean to an internal observer living in the non-standard universe, but appear
to be non-Archimedean to an external observer outside the universe.

A freshman-level accessible formulation of the transfer principle is [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Keisler's]] book ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''.

===Example===
Every real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;x \geq \lfloor x \rfloor ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \,\cdot\, \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor and ceiling functions|integer part]] function.  By a typical application of the transfer principle, every hyperreal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;x \geq {}^{*}\! \lfloor x \rfloor ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{}^{*}\! \lfloor \,\cdot\, \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the natural extension of the integer part function.  If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, then the [[hyperinteger]] &lt;math&gt;{}^{*}\! \lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, as well.

== Generalizations of the concept of number ==
Historically, the concept of [[number]] has been repeatedly generalized.  The addition of [[0 (number)|0]] to the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; was a major intellectual accomplishment in its time.  The addition of negative integers to form &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; already constituted a departure from the realm of immediate experience to the realm of mathematical models.  The further extension, the rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, is more familiar to a layperson than their completion &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, partly because the reals do not correspond to any physical reality (in the sense of measurement and computation) different from that represented by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the notion of an irrational number is meaningless to even the most powerful floating-point computer.  The necessity for such an extension stems not from physical observation but rather from the internal requirements of mathematical coherence.  The infinitesimals entered mathematical discourse at a time when such a notion was required by mathematical developments at the time, namely the emergence of what became known as the [[calculus|infinitesimal calculus]].  As already mentioned above, the mathematical justification for this latest extension was delayed by three centuries.  [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Keisler]] wrote:
:"In discussing the real line we remarked that we have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither.  However, in applications of the calculus, it is helpful to imagine a line in physical space as a hyperreal line."

The [[consistency|self-consistent]] development of the hyperreals turned out to be possible if every true [[first-order logic]] statement that uses basic arithmetic (the [[natural number]]s, plus, times, comparison) and quantifies only over the real numbers was assumed to be true in a reinterpreted form if we presume that it quantifies over hyperreal numbers. For example, we can state that for every real number there is another number greater than it:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \quad \exists y \in\mathbb{R}\quad   x &lt; y. &lt;/math&gt;

The same will then also hold for hyperreals:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in {}^\star\mathbb{R} \quad \exists y \in {}^\star\mathbb{R}\quad  x &lt; y. &lt;/math&gt;

Another example is the statement that if you add 1 to a number you get a bigger number:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \quad x &lt; x+1 &lt;/math&gt;

which will also hold for hyperreals:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in {}^\star\mathbb{R} \quad  x &lt; x+1. &lt;/math&gt;

The correct general statement that formulates these equivalences is called the transfer principle.  Note that, in many formulas in analysis, quantification is over higher-order objects such as functions and sets, which makes the transfer principle somewhat more subtle than the above examples suggest.

== Differences between R and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;R==

The transfer principle however doesn't mean that '''R''' and *'''R''' have identical behavior. For instance, in *'''R''' there exists an element ''&amp;omega;'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1+1&lt;\omega, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

but there is no such number in '''R'''. This is possible because the nonexistence of this number cannot be expressed as a first order statement of the above type. A hyperreal number like ''&amp;omega;'' is called infinitely large; the reciprocals of the infinitely large numbers are the infinitesimals.

The hyperreals *'''R''' form an [[ordered field]] containing the reals '''R''' as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard [[metric space]], but by virtue of their order they carry an order [[topology]].

== Constructions of the hyperreals ==

The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an [[ultrafilter]], but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed. [[Vladimir Kanovei]] and Shelah&lt;ref name=kanovei2003&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kanovei|first1=Vladimir| last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon| title=A definable nonstandard model of the reals| url=http://shelah.logic.at/files/825.pdf| journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=69|year=2004| pages=159–164 | doi=10.2178/jsl/1080938834|arxiv=math/0311165}}&lt;/ref&gt; give a construction of a definable, countably saturated elementary extension of the structure consisting of the reals and all finitary relations on it.

In its most general form, transfer is a bounded [[elementary equivalence|elementary embedding]] between structures.

== Statement ==

The [[ordered field]] &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' of [[nonstandard real number]]s properly includes the [[real number|real]] field '''R'''.  Like all ordered fields that properly include '''R''', this field is non-Archimedean.   It means that some members ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' are [[infinitesimal]], i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt; \underbrace{\left|x\right|+\cdots+\left|x\right|}_{n \text{ terms}} &lt; 1 \text{ for every finite cardinal number } n.&lt;/math&gt;

The only infinitesimal in ''R'' is 0.  Some other members of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''', the reciprocals ''y'' of the nonzero infinitesimals, are infinite, i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{n\text{ terms}}&lt;\left|y\right|
\text{ for every finite cardinal number } n.&lt;/math&gt;

The underlying set of the field &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' is the image of '''R''' under a mapping ''A''&amp;nbsp;{{mapsto}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' from subsets ''A'' of '''R''' to subsets of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''.  In every case

: &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq {^*\!A}, &lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if ''A'' is finite.  Sets of the form &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' for some &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,\subseteq\,\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''standard''' subsets of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''.  The standard sets belong to a much larger class of subsets of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' called '''internal''' sets.  Similarly each function

: &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

extends to a function

: &lt;math&gt; {^*\! f} : {^*\!A} \rightarrow {^*\mathbb{R}};&lt;/math&gt;

these are called '''standard functions''', and belong to the much larger class of '''internal functions'''.  Sets and functions that are not internal are '''external'''.

The importance of these concepts stems from their role in the following proposition and is illustrated by the examples that follow it.

The '''transfer principle:'''

* Suppose a proposition that is true of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' can be expressed via functions of finitely many variables (e.g. (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;{{mapsto}}&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''), relations among finitely many variables (e.g. ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''), finitary logical connectives such as '''and''', '''or''', '''not''', '''if...then...''', and the quantifiers

:: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\text{ and }\exists x\in\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

: For example, one such proposition is

:: &lt;math&gt; \forall x\in\mathbb{R} \ \exists y\in\mathbb{R} \ x+y=0.&lt;/math&gt;

: Such a proposition is true in '''R''' if and only if it is true in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' when the quantifier

:: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in {^*\!\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;

: replaces

:: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

: and similarly for &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;.

* Suppose a proposition otherwise expressible as simply as those considered above mentions some particular sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,\subseteq\,\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  Such a proposition is true in '''R''' if and only if it is true in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' with each such "''A''" replaced by the corresponding &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A''.  Here are two examples:
:* The set
::: &lt;math&gt; [0,1]^\ast = \{\,x\in\mathbb{R}:0\leq x\leq 1\,\}^\ast&lt;/math&gt;
:: must be
::: &lt;math&gt; \{\,x \in {^*\mathbb{R}} : 0 \le x \le 1 \,\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: including not only members of '''R''' between 0 and 1 inclusive, but also members of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' between 0 and 1 that differ from those by infinitesimals.  To see this, observe that the sentence
::: &lt;math&gt; \forall x\in\mathbb{R} \ (x\in [0,1] \text{ if and only if } 0\leq x \leq 1)&lt;/math&gt;
:: is true in '''R''', and apply the transfer principle.
:* The set &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''N''' must have no upper bound in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' (since the sentence expressing the non-existence of an upper bound of '''N''' in '''R''' is simple enough for the transfer principle to apply to it) and must contain ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 if it contains ''n'', but must not contain anything between ''n'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Members of
::: &lt;math&gt; {^*\mathbb{N}} \setminus \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
:: are "infinite integers".)
* Suppose a proposition otherwise expressible as simply as those considered above contains the quantifier
:: &lt;math&gt; \forall A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\dots\text{ or }\exists A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\dots\ .&lt;/math&gt;
: Such a proposition is true in '''R''' if and only if it is true in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' after the changes specified above and the replacement of the quantifiers with
:: &lt;math&gt; [\forall \text{ internal } A\subseteq{^*\mathbb{R}}\dots] &lt;/math&gt;
: and
:: &lt;math&gt; [\exists \text{ internal } A\subseteq{^*\mathbb{R}}\dots]\ .&lt;/math&gt;

==Three examples==
The appropriate setting for the hyperreal transfer principle is the world of ''internal'' entities.  Thus, the well-ordering property of the natural numbers by transfer yields the fact that every internal subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a least element. In this section internal sets are discussed in more detail.
* Every nonempty ''internal'' subset of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' that has an upper bound in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' has a least upper bound in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''.  Consequently the set of all infinitesimals is external.
** The well-ordering principle implies every nonempty ''internal'' subset of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''N''' has a smallest member.  Consequently the set
::: &lt;math&gt; {^*\mathbb{N}} \setminus \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:: of all infinite integers is external.
* If ''n'' is an infinite integer, then the set {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} (which is not standard) must be internal.  To prove this, first observe that the following is trivially true:
::: &lt;math&gt; \forall n\in\mathbb{N} \ \exists A\subseteq\mathbb{N} \ \forall x\in\mathbb{N} \ [x\in A \text{ iff } x \leq n].&lt;/math&gt;
:: Consequently
::: &lt;math&gt; \forall n \in {^*\mathbb{N}} \ \exists \text{ internal } A \subseteq {^*\mathbb{N}} \ \forall x \in {^*\mathbb{N}} \ [x\in A \text{ iff } x\leq n].&lt;/math&gt;
* As with internal sets, so with internal functions: Replace
:: &lt;math&gt; \forall f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \dots &lt;/math&gt;
: with
:: &lt;math&gt; \forall\text{ internal } f: {^*\!A}\rightarrow {^*\mathbb{R}} \dots&lt;/math&gt;
: when applying the transfer principle, and similarly with &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;.
: For example: If ''n'' is an infinite integer, then the complement of the image of any internal [[one-to-one function]] ''&amp;fnof;'' from the infinite set {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} into {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3} has exactly three members by the transfer principle.  Because of the infiniteness of the domain, the complements of the images of one-to-one functions from the former set to the latter come in many sizes, but most of these functions are external.

: This last example motivates an important definition: A '''*-finite''' (pronounced '''star-finite''') subset of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' is one that can be placed in ''internal'' one-to-one correspondence with {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} for some ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''N'''.

The '''unicolor cribo''' (''Drymarchon melanurus unicolor'') is a Central American subspecies of the [[Cribo|cribo snakes]]. The eastern [[indigo snake]], ''Drymarchon corais couperi'' is another species of this genus. Until recently the unicolor cribo was considered a subspecies of the same species as the indigo snake ''Drymarchon corais unicolor''.

Unlike the [[indigo snake]], which is dark blue to almost black, the unicolor cribo has a yellow or golden color with black facial and neck bar-like markings. 

This snake reaches a length of over nine feet. It is terrestrial and [[diurnality|diurnal]]. It can be found in marshes, swamps, and riverbeds. The unicolor cribo is non-venomous. It bites its prey without coiling around it. It pins its prey, crushing it, and then swallows it whole. Its prey consists of other snakes, including [[venomous snake]]s, small mammals, small birds, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[fish]], and other small [[vertebrate]] animals.
