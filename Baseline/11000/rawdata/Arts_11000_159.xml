      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2662">'''Akka bakka bonka rakka''' is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[nursery rhyme]] of mostly nonsense words used to select or point out a participant in children's games, such as who will be "it" in a game like [[hide-and-seek]] ({{lang-no|gjemsel}}) or [[Tag (game)|tag]] ({{lang-no|sisten}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berulfsen |first1=Bjarne |title=Ordet går videre: Nye kåserier om ordenes liv |date=1969 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Oslo |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Svensen |first1=Åsfrid |title=Tekstens mønstre: innføring i litterær analyse |date=1985 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is classified as a [[Counting-out game|counting rhyme]] in Nora Kobberstad's ''Norsk Lekebok'' (Book of Norwegian Games) from 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hagemann |first1=Sonja |title=Barnelitteratur i Norge 1850–1914 |date=1970 |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |pages=269-270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different versions of the rhyme. The following version was recorded in [[Elverum]] in the early 1920s by [[Sigurd Nergaard]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nergaard |first1=Sigurd |title=Eventyr, barnevers, spurningar og ordspraak. Folkeminne frå Østerdalen III |date=1923 |publisher=Kristiania Norsk Folkeminnelag |location=Kristiania |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Akka bakka,''
:''banka ranka,''
:''etla metla, sang dang,''
:''fil i fang, isa, bisa, topp!''

In 1936, it was included in a collection of children's rhymes published by [[Rikka Deinboll]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deinboll |first1=Rikka |title=Barnerim og barneregler |date=1936 |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Akka bakka bonka rakka''
:''etla metla sjong dong''
:''fili fong
:''issa bissa topp''

[[Finn Myrvang]] reproduced it in 1964 in a version from [[Andøya]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myrvang |first1=Finn |title=Huh-tetta |date=1964 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Akka bakka bonka rakka, issa bissa topp.
:''Sjong dong filifong, stékk om stein - stå!

A later version, published by the Children's Book Club (''Bokklubbens barn''), has the following form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ro, ro til Regleland |date=1979 |publisher=Bokklubbens barn |location=Stabekk |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Folklore Society''' ('''AFS''') is the [[United States|US]]-based [[professional association]] for [[folklorist]]s, with members from the US, [[Canada]], and around the world, which aims to encourage research, aid in disseminating that research, promote the responsible application of that research, publish various forms of publications, advocate for the continued study and teaching of [[folklore]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=Bylaws |title=Bylaws |website= American Folklore Society|accessdate= May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is based at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] and has an annual meeting every October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsnet.org/news/215304/AFS-to-Move-to-Indiana-University.htm|title=AFS to Move to Indiana University - American Folklore Society|website=www.afsnet.org|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's quarterly publication is the ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]''. The current president is [[Kay Turner]], an independent scholar and public folklorist who has held the position since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?Officers|title=Executive Board - American Folklore Society|website=www.afsnet.org|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present{{when|date=February 2016}} almost half of its 2,200 members practice their work outside [[higher education]]. In addition to professors, members include [[arts administrator]]s, freelance researchers, [[librarians]], [[museum]] [[curator]]s, and others involved in the study and promotion of [[folklore]] and [[traditional culture]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
The society is associated with the more Europe oriented [[International Society for Ethnology and Folklore]] (SIEF).

== History ==
AFS was founded in 1888 by [[William Wells Newell]],&lt;ref name="afs foundation"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3813877 | title=William Wells Newell and the Foundation of American Folklore Scholarship | author=Bell, Michael J | journal=[[Journal of the Folklore Institute]] |date=Jun–Aug 1973 | volume=10 | issue=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stood at the center of a diverse group of university-based scholars, museum anthropologists, and men and women of letters and affairs. In 1945, the society became a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acls.org/societies/societies.aspx?sid=3E895C50-C9A2-DB11-A735-000C2903E717 |title=American Folklore Society|website=ACLS.org|accessdate= May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFS is also an active member of the [[National Humanities Alliance]] (NHS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhalliance.org/membership/list/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130704091101/http://www.nhalliance.org/membership/list/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 4, 2013 |title=Members List |website=National Humanities Alliance |date=May 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, prominent members of the American Folklore Society known outside academic circles have included [[Marius Barbeau]], [[Franz Boas]], [[Ben Botkin]], [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], [[Linda Dégh]], [[Ella Deloria]], [[Thomas A.

The '''Apple Design Awards''' (also known as the '''ADA''') is a special event hosted by [[Apple Inc.]] at its annual [[Worldwide Developers Conference]]. The event is meant to recognize the best and most innovative [[Macintosh]] and [[iOS]] [[software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] produced by [[independent software vendor|independent developers]], as well as the best and most creative uses of Apple's products. The ADAs, as they are commonly known, are awarded in a variety of categories which vary from year to year. The Apple Design Awards have been presented each year since 1996, though for the first two years of their existence they were known as the '''Human Interface Design Excellence (HIDE) Awards'''.

Since 2003 the physical awards were designed with an Apple logo that glows when touched. The trophy is an aluminum cube, and each side is 3.9 inches (or 10 cm) long. The cube weighs 55.5 ounces (1575 grams)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pixelmator|title=Apple Design Award|url=http://www.pixelmator.com/ada/|accessdate=2018-04-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731173705/http://www.pixelmator.com/ada/|archivedate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Maciejowski Tower of Babel.jpg|thumb|right|A high medieval construction site from the [[Maciejowski Bible]].]]
'''''Artes Mechanicae''''' or '''mechanical arts''', are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts [[Artes liberales]]. Also called "servile" and "vulgar",&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cicero's''De Officiis'', Book I, xxlii.&lt;/ref&gt; from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man, as ministering to baser needs.

==Overview==
[[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (9th century) divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts: 
*''vestiaria'' ([[tailor]]ing, [[weaving]])
*''agricultura'' ([[agriculture]])
*''architectura'' ([[architecture]], [[masonry]])
*''militia''  and ''venatoria'' ([[war]]fare and [[hunting]], Military education, "[[martial arts]]")
*''mercatura'' ([[trade]])
*''coquinaria'' ([[cooking]])
*''metallaria'' ([[blacksmithing]], [[metallurgy]])&lt;ref&gt;In his commentary on Martianus Capella's early fifth century work, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', one of the main sources for medieval reflection on the liberal arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Didascalicon]]'', [[Hugh of St Victor]] (12th century) includes [[navigation]], [[medicine]] and [[theatre|theatrical arts]] instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Hugues de Saint-Victor, ''Libri septem eruditiones didascaliae'', ch.26 (PL 176, col.760): lanificium, armaturum, navigationem, agriculturem, venationem, medicinam, theatricam&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.&lt;ref&gt;See Georges Legoff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'', (Chicago, University of Chicago Press) 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention of Art"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Dr. Larry | year = 2003 | pages = 28–30 |title=[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]] |publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of the ''Artes Mechanicae'' as applied [[geometry]] was introduced to Western Europe by [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.

In the 19th century "mechanic arts" referred to fields of which some are now known as [[engineering]].  Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the [[performing arts]] and the [[fine arts]] which were for the upper class of the time, and the [[intelligentsia]].  The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.

Related phrases, "[[useful arts]]," or "applied arts" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.

The most famous usage of the term "mechanic arts" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].

An '''artistic director''' may refer to someone who directs a [[musical ensemble]], and in this medium, is often abbreviated as simply Director. The typical jobs of a musical artistic director are to choose repertoire for the ensemble, come up with an artistic vision for the group and also a long-term strategy for programming, and also to help choose performers if the ensemble is not pre-set. An artistic director may also be—and often is—the conductor of the ensemble and a "jack of all trades", performing multiple roles and even managing the ensemble, although that role is often left to a [[Managing Director]] if financial resources are available. A musical artistic director essentially mirrors a theatrical [[artistic director]], albeit working in a different medium.

'''''Brooklyn Bridge''''' is a 1915 painting by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. ''Brooklyn Bridge'' was exhibited at the Montross Gallery, New York, 1916 (no. 40) along with works by [[Jean Crotti]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/frick-31072002256933 ''Exhibition of pictures by Jean Crotti, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger'', Montross Gallery, New York, April 4 to April 22, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the first in a series of three highly [[Abstract art|abstract]] paintings by Gleizes of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes'', From Grove Art Online, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most abstract painting of the bridge to date. Gleizes and the Italian-American artist [[Joseph Stella]] had been friends since 1915 and it has been of interest to compare this painting with Stella's ''Brooklyn Bridge'' of 1919-20.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The American collector [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]] acquired ''Brooklyn Bridge'' and several other works by Gleizes that had been on view at Montross Gallery, either during the exhibition or subsequently. In 1927, an exhibition and sale of Quinn's art collection took place in New York City. The sale was conducted by Otto Bernet and Hiram H. Parke at the American Art Galleries. A catalogue was published for the occasion by the [[American Art Association]]. ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (n. 263 of the catalogue) was purchased at the sale for $60.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/paintingssculptu00amer#page/110/mode/2up/search/gleizes ''Paintings and sculptures, The renowned collection of modern and ultra-modern art formed by the late John Quinn]'', Exhibition and sale at the American Art Galleries, Sale conducted by Bernet and Parke, Published by American Art Association, New York, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brooklyn Bridge'' forms part of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] Founding Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/about-the-collection/new-york/solomon-r-guggenheim-founding-collection/1648 Solomon R.

The painting is in the permanent collection of the [[Solomon R.

''Brooklyn Bridge'' is an oil and gouache painting on canvas with dimensions 102 x 102&amp;nbsp;cm (40 1/8 x 40 1/8 inches) inscribed "Brooklyn Bridge, Alb. Gleizes, 15, lower right.

In a celebration of this feat of modernity, the architecture of the Brooklyn Bridge served as the inspiration for a series of works by Gleizes. In this first painting of the series, juxtaposed arabesques and distinctive diagonals interconnect dynamically, suggesting the bridge's complex architectonic engineering.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim N.Y."&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1470 Albert Gleizes, ''On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge)'', Guggenheim Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in earlier works by Gleizes, this canvas is directly engaged with the environment. While highly abstract, ''Brooklyn Bridge'' maintains an evident visual basis. From 1914 to the end of the New York period, however nonrepresentational, works by the artist continued to be shaped by his personal experience, by the conviction that art was a social function, susceptible to theoretical formulation, and imbued with optimism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/239 Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'']. Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: "...let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be banished—in any event, not yet. An art cannot be raised to the level of pure effusion at the first step."&lt;ref&gt;''Du "Cubisme"'', Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, Paris, Figuière, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, the transformation toward pure effusion would manifest itself in the ''Brooklyn Bridge'' and continue further still in subsequent works produced by the artist in New York.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The features of the bridge are described by forceful rhythms and colors, even though the actual bridge itself has disappeared; superseded by a synthesis of Gleizes's plastic equivalents of physical reality. The three Brooklyn Bridge paintings are a prime example of Gleizes's experimentation with the plastic translation of one of his most treasured themes: ''the city which draws life from the river''.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Already, in his 1913 publication ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]'', [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] drew parallels between the work of Gleizes and the realization of metal constructions such as bridges:

:Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. He thus brings a startling innovation to contemporary art. Something that before him was found in but few of the modern painters.&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=1299781650906252 ''The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters'', Vol. 9, No. 1: Stella Number, editor: Margaret C.

:This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things.&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

:This art is vigorous. The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels. (Apollinaire, 1913)&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

==Background==
Gleizes stated his admiration for the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in the first interview after his arrival in the United States, comparing it to the noblest achievements of European architecture.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The Brooklyn Bridge was a key component of the New York landscape for the [[Ashcan School]], though it hadn't held for them the fascination that it did for the generation of modern artists that arrived or returned from Europe during the First World War.&lt;ref name="Kachur"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/brooklyn_bridge/pdf/GERB_08_The_Bridge_As_Icon.pdf Lewis Kachur, ''The Bridge As Icon'', Brooklyn Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Stella wrote of the Brooklyn Bridge: "Seen for the first time, as a weird metallic Apparition under a metallic sky, out of proportion with the winged lightness of its arch, traced for the conjunction of Worlds… it impressed me as the shrine containing all the efforts of the new civilization of America".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stella, ''The Brooklyn Bridge (A page of my life)'', transition 16, June 1929, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt;

Albert Gleizes remarked: "the genius who built the Brooklyn Bridge is to be classed alongside the genius who built Notre Dame de Paris".&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes quoted in The Literary Digest, 51, November 27, 1915, p. 1225&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting Gleizes' claim that the Brooklyn Bridge belongs in the same category as the Notre Dame Cathedral, Marcel Duchamp said America's greatest works of art are its bridges and its plumbing.&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt; (Stella and [[Walter Arensberg]] accompanied Duchamp to a plumbing supply store in 1917 to purchase the infamous urinal, soon to be entitled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' and signed "R.Mutt").&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, ''Marcel Duchamp: A Biography'', Henry Holt, New York, 1996, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Stella, 1919-20, Brooklyn Bridge, oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|230px|Joseph Stella, 1919-20, ''Brooklyn Bridge'', oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, [[Yale University Art Gallery]]]]
Whereas other proto-modernists such as [[Henry James]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] pondered the bridge from a distance—contemplating its cultural and industrial aspects—artists like [[John Marin]], [[Max Weber]], [[Joseph Stella]] and Gleizes worked directly at the bridge itself, reveling in the personal experience.&lt;ref name="Richard Haw"&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=ungu-NmjQNgC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=gleizes,+Brooklyn+Bridge,+1915&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xfBo-eJqO0&amp;sig=S8yIHzZUdsuNv4xVbaQ6SXnSYsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hHnPVNn0Ecuz7gbnuYCgDw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes&amp;f=false Richard Haw, ''Art of the Brooklyn Bridge: A Visual History'', Routledge, 2 October 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; This is what [[Alan Trachtenberg]] called “the classic moment” when the bridge—in front of the eyes—transforms itself from a public icon to “a private event”. The classic moment is not studied or pondered but entirely instant and radically subjective. It is a personal response to modernity of the unique structure, an attempt to “know the bridge from the inside”.&lt;ref name="Richard Haw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Trachtenberg, ''Brooklyn Bridge: Fact and Symbol'', Chicago, London, University of Chicago Press, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

Stemming back to his years at the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], the interest in ambitious subjects continued to inspire Albert Gleizes throughout the 1910s: ''[[Passy, Bridges of Paris (Gleizes)|Passy, Bridges of Paris]]'', ''[[La Chasse (painting)|La Chasse (The Hunt)]]'', ''[[Harvest Threshing|Harvest Threshing (Le Dépiquage des Moissons)]]'', ''[[Les Joueurs de football|Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)]]''. From 1915, Gleizes drew inspiration from the music of jazz, from the skyscrapers of New York, from neon signs, from the hustle and bustle of busy Manhattan streets and avenues such as Broadway, and from the Brooklyn Bridge; expressing the various sensations and vast drama of modern city life in an unprecedented series of works.&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by [[Carlos Salzedo]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Jean Crotti]] (who would eventually marry [[Suzanne Duchamp]]). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;

Gleizes had previously been to New York for the occasion of the [[Armory Show]] (which in 1913 introduced European [[modern art]] to an American audience), exhibiting his ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)]]’’, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], and ''[[Man on a Balcony|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]’’, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

In New York Gleizes met [[Walter Pach]] (who he knew from Paris), [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Joseph Stella]], and participated in a show at Montross Gallery (April 1916)—exhibiting Brooklyn Bridge—with Duchamp, Crotti and Metzinger (who remained in Paris). At this exhibition the group was dubbed 'The Four Musketeers' in the press.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/04/artseen/jean-crotti-inhabiting-abstraction John Yau, Jean Croti, Inhabiting Abstraction, The Brooklyn Rail, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=j_9DhsBoyS4C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=musketeers,+walter+pach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=geNJiQtL7r&amp;sig=4l8dEZlDUt7u1aF3Kypfygl_-1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MOnPVKzRDIee7gaPsoDoDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=musketeers%2C%20walter%20pach&amp;f=false Laurette E. McCarthy, Walter Pach, ''Walter Pach (1883-1958): The Armory Show and the Untold Story of Modern Art in America'', Penn State Press, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The Montross exhibition introduced some of the most [[avant-garde]] French art of the time to the New York art scene, causing a sensation and once again forcing American artists to rethink their ideas about art. This exhibitions demonstrated that there existed an even more radical approach in art than that offered by the Futurists and Cubists, who were considered at the time to represent the most extreme forms of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa133.htm Francis M.

After Gleizes returned to Europe, Stella became interested in the Bridge as a motif. In Paris, from 1911 to 1912, Stella had been in contact with the Cubists and Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], who admired contemporary concepts of the future, including motion, speed and technological triumphs of humanity over nature. When he return to New York he moved to Brooklyn and there found in the Bridge the perfect vehicle for his Futurist vision, though he was also interested in the structural experiments of the Cubists and the dynamic color of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]].&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Haskell, ''Joseph Stella'', Whitney Museum of American Art (exhibition catalogue), New York, 1994, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstraction==
Gleizes' ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (his first painting of the bridge) was the most abstract image made of the bridge to date.&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt; His second version, also of 1915, measuring 148.1 x 120.4&amp;nbsp;cm (58¼ x 47 3/8in.), is entirely abstract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/albert-gleizes-brooklyn-bridge-3948030-details.aspx Albert Gleizes, 1915, Brooklyn Bridge, oil and sand on cardboard, 148.1 x 120.4 cm (58¼ x 47 3/8in.), Christie's London, Impressionist and Modern Evening Sale, Lot 14, 25 June 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; His third and last oil painting of the series, dated 1917 and entitled ''On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge)'', [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York,&lt;ref name="Guggenheim N.Y." /&gt; measures 161.8 x 129.5&amp;nbsp;cm (63 3/4 x 51 in.). This composition relates most closely with a 1915 drawing (25 x 19&amp;nbsp;cm). It is an attempt to synthesize New York City under the symbol of the bridge through a collection of unifying circles, spheres and arcs. In the composition Gleizes portrays both ends of the bridge with the East River below. The Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn appear in the distance. This 1917 canvas—the least abstract of the three—more so than the other paintings of the series, resembles Stella's 1919-20 painting.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

Non-objective painting rarely has to do with realistic qualities and yet it is still bound to the logic of painting as representational of the subject matter. In Andrei Nakov's study, ''Abstract/Concrete - Russian and Polish Non-objective Art'', non-representation itself becomes the impetus for depicting a subject. In his last book, ''Painting and on Man become Painter'', written in 1948, Gleizes warns against the trend of non-representation becoming an end unto itself, insisting on the importance, instead, of [[esemplastic]] qualities. For Gleizes, the latter prevails over the concepts of representational or abstract qualities of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;

Toward the end of 1913 Gleizes defended the need for a representational subject matter in 'Opinion' published by [[Ricciotto Canudo]] in Monjoie!, but it was for reasons that were entirely plastic and non-representational at the same time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are agreed that anecdote counts for nothing in a painted work. It is a pretext, so be it, but a pretext which we should not reject. Through a certain coefficient of imitation we will verify the legitimacy of the things we have discovered, the picture will not be reduced to the merely pleasurable arabesque of an oriental carpet, and we will obtain an infinite variety which would otherwise be impossible. (Gleizes, 1913)&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', Gleizes writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we can see straightaway, it is not a matter of describing, nor is it a matter of abstracting from, anything that is external to itself. There is a concrete act that has to be realized, a reality to be produced - of the same order as that which everyone is prepared to recognize in music, at the lowest level of the esemplastic scale, and in architecture, at the highest.&lt;ref&gt;The hierarchy of esemplastic acts is a primary theme of the theoretical ''Essai de Généralisation'' which Gleizes intended to attach to ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'' when it was published by the Bauhaus&lt;/ref&gt; Like any natural, physical reality, painting, understood in this way, will touch anyone who knows how to enter into it, not through their opinions on something that exists independently of it, but through its own existence, through those inter-relations, constantly in movement, which enable us to transmit life itself. (Gleizes, 1928)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic ''Albert Gleizes, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in a German version in 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', in Bauhausbücher. The French version was published as ''L’Epopée'' (''The Epic''), in the journal Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Chinsō''' 頂相 (alternatively pronounced Chinzō) are commemorative portraits of [[Zen master|Zen masters]], a traditional form of East Asian art, specifically Zen art. They can be painted or sculpted and usually present a Zen master ceremonially dressed and seated upright in chair&lt;ref name="''baroni''"&gt;Baroni, Helen Josephine. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism. The Rosen Publishing, Group Inc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. Chinsō include realistic portraits of prominent Zen monks, possibly commissioned by them and painted while they were alive or shortly after they died, as well as depictions of famous Zen patriarchs from the past&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;commissioned by his disciples&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sherman E. Reflections of Reality in Japanese Art. The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Chinsō were believed to have been passed down by Zen masters to their disciples as a symbol of [[Dharma transmission|dharma transmission]], and known to have been meant for use in rituals, especially to represent the deceased during memorial services, and as an icon for their followers&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;. Before monks would die, they would sometimes write a simple poem in the upper part of their portrait called [[Eulogy|eulogy]], or have another author or monk write an inscription at the top. In Japan many remaining sculptural Buddhist chinsō are made out of wood, which may explain why so few remain in China and Korea on account of the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|Huichang persecution]] when most wooden sculptures perished&lt;ref&gt;Pat, Youngsook. Handbook of Korean Art Buddhist Sculpture. Yekyong Publishing Co, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the oldest surviving chinsō of Chan masters were brought from China to Japan; about 12 of those are extant&lt;ref name="''folk''"&gt;Foulk T. Griffith, Sharf Robert H. On the Ritual Use of Ch'an Portraiture in Medieval China. In: Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie, Vol. 7, 1993. pp. 149-219.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Background and History ==
[[File:Zhongfeng Mingben.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Chinese Monk Zhongfeng Mingben|332x332px]]Chinsō flourished during the [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1279-1368) dynasties in China, and were introduced in Japan during the Kamakura period (1185-1333). They are considered historically significant because of their antiquity, preservation and artistic quality&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. There are about 70 known surviving chinsō from China and Japan from the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries that are designated “national treasures,” but about ten times that number have survived in Japanese museums and temple collections&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;.

=== In China ===
[[File:Portrait of the Monk Zhongfeng Mingben, 14th century.jpg|thumb|Another portrait of Monk Zhongfeng Mingben|363x363px]]Chinsō emerged from mainstream traditions of Chinese portraiture during the Song dynasty (960-1279)&lt;ref name="''lippit''"&gt;Lippit, Yukio. “Negative Verisimilitude: The Zen Portrait in Medieval Japan.” In Asian Art History in the Twenty-First Century, edited by Vishaka Desai, 64-95. Williamstown: Sterling and Francine Clari Art Institute, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. Nothing visually distinguished them from other portraits done at the time of Chinese elite; the formal qualities were all the same&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Chinsō are mainly understood to follow this basic formula: the monk is seated cross legged in a chair, feet hidden, with his shoes on a footstool in front of him, in a three quarter view, and ceremonially dressed with inner and outer robes and a kasaya or surplice draped over his left shoulder&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The surplice is can be held together with an ornamental ring right over the monk’s heart&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. He usually holds something in his right hand, like a whisk, scepter, staff or bamboo&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. They follow the highest standard for painting at the time&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. As well as following the same basic formula of Chinese portraiture, chinsō assumed the characteristics of Chinese portraiture in general. These included private ownership, verse inscriptions, their role in social networks&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Surviving chinsō also include many works created in Japan once Zen Buddhism was brought there from China&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;.
[[File:Portrait of Zen Monk Ikkyū Sōjun (1394-1481).jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Japanese Monk Ikkyū Sōjun(1394-1481)|360x360px]]
[[File:Portrait of Ikkyū Sōjun.jpg|left|thumb|Another Portrait of Ikkyū Sōjun|160x160px]]
=== In Japan ===
When Zen Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese style of portraiture as well as these traditions surrounding chinsō, were brought with them. This realistic style was not typical in Japan and set chinsō apart from other portraits at the time in Japan because of their high degree of verisimilitude&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Although most easily identifiable chinsō have the subject seated in a chair, in three quarter profile against a black background, with an inscription at the top, not all chinsō followed this rigid formula&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The portraits of Japanese monks Mokuan Shuyu and [[Ikkyū|Ikkyu Sojun]] represent this identifiable formula, but the alternative version of Ikkyu Sojun does not. Instead of being seated in three quarter view, the monk or patriarch could be shown frontally, or as a full figure, and could be in a circular frame instead of simply as a figure against a blank background. Less common are chinsō showing a monk in meditation in a landscape setting, where he could be either walking or sitting. Chinsō are usually inscribed at the top with a eulogy written in free verse, describing who the patriarch was, why it was made and possibly who wrote the eulogy and why. Some scholars distinguish chinsō from the soshizō 祖師像 category, which includes portraits of legendary patriarchs from the distant past, by checking whether or not the portrait is inscribed. It’s also important to note that the soshizō were not as realistic as the chinsō.
== Origin of the term chinsō ==
Chinsō, or dingxiang in Chinese, is a Chinese Buddhist neologism, and was originally a translation for the Sanskrit term [[Usnisa|uṣṇīṣa]]&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The usnisa is the term coined for the fleshy protuberance on top of the Buddha’s head&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. In India it was said to be invisible because it is unable to be seen by living beings&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. During the Song dynasty in China, the term chinsō began being used for portraits of Zen monks as we know the term today&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The existence of a protuberance on top of a Buddha’s head represented the fact he had reached enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj. The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development. Munshiram Manoharial Publishers, New Delhi, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;, similar to how chinsō were thought to prove enlightenment when passed down from a monk to his disciple. 

== Functions of chinsō ==
Chinsō have been known to serve many purposes throughout their history. The category includes portraits commissioned by the Zen monks themselves and painted while they are alive or shortly after they had died, and portraits commissioned by famous Zen patriarchs’ disciples to be used for worship. Scholars have also concluded that they could have been used as certificates or proof of dharma transmission&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. By proof of dharma transmission, it is meant that the portraits were thought to have been passed down from Zen master to their disciples when they became enlightened, since dharma transmission is the recognition of the enlightenment in a monk’s successor and the passing down of lineage. This theory has since been questioned by scholars&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Since the category of chinsō is so broad and includes portraits used for worship as well as portraits used to represent dharma transmission, the category could use stricter guidelines for classifying portrait as chinsō. The true function of chinsō is under questions by scholars for the purpose of clarifying the category&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;.

More recently (since about 1994) it has come to the attention of scholars that chinsō were used in a mortuary context, rather than used to certify or authenticate dharma transmission. This was particularly the case in China.  They were used after monks had died, meaning that they were used like other icons are: as a receptacle for a deity in a ritual context&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;, like objects of worship in temples. An article by T. Griffith Foulk and Robert Sharf published in 1994 attempted to demystify this part of Zen culture by clarifying that chinsō did not serve as evidence of dharma transmission but are simply a category of Buddhist portraiture used in a mortuary context&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Their inscriptions provide possible legitimization to lineage of transmission and possible affiliation, but are said to not have been given for the sole purpose of certifying enlightenment. This argument is supported by their claims that chinsō, unlike more important items for representing transmission like a monk’s robes, were passed out freely in China to “laymen, novices, merchants, and the like”&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Their argument goes on to say chinsō could have just been part of the regular gift giving tradition. Different recipients of chinsō include designated dharma heirs associated with specific linages, another meaningful relation to the monk, who received the portrait as a gift or an anonymous person who received the portrait at a fundraiser (a “hauzshu” in Chinese)&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The purpose and usage of chinsō is still in question by scholars. 
[[File:Statue of the monk Chikotsu Dai'e.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Monk Chikotsu Dai'e]]
Some dharma lineages have been heavily influenced by portraiture&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. For example, the Portrait of Chikotsu Dai’e established Chikotsu Dai’e 癡兀大慧 (1229-1312) as a disciple of the Chan monk Enni Ben’e 円爾弁円(1202-1280) because the inscription of the chinsō is similar to that of Enni Ben’en’s on his own portrait, and Enni’s is similar to that of his predecessor [[Wuzhun Shifan|Wuzun Shifan]] 無準師範 (1178-1249), a Chinese Chan monk&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The portrait of Wuzun Shih-fan was brought by his disciple Enni Ben’en to Japan in 1241 and is one of the oldest surviving chinsō&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Chikotsu Dai’e’s portrait thus establishes the genealogical sequence of Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni and then to Chikotsu&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Even though it is unclear if chinsō served as certificates of dharma transmission, throughout history they have been used to show a direct line of dharma transmission and lineage&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The portraits of these three monks show a clear acknowledgment of enlightenment from one monk to his disciple, from Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni Ben’en to Chikotsu Dai’e. Although each monk may not have passed down their chinsō to his disciple as proof of transmission, we can undertsand the history of lineage as being shown through the passing down of the portraits.

The '''cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] cinema together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]].

Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. The first [[sound film]], ''Sing-Song Girl Red Peony'', using the [[sound-on-disc]] technology, was made in 1931. The 1930s, considered the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] was reflected in the films produced. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to [[Hong Kong]], [[Chongqing]] and other places, starting a "Solitary Island" period in Shanghai, referring to the city's foreign concessions, with the remaining filmmakers working there. ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), the first [[Chinese animation|Chinese animated]] feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later [[Osamu Tezuka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "A Wartime Romance: Princess Iron Fan and the Chinese Connection in Early Japanese Animation," in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China.|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison.|year = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 15–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.

After the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming, with films such as ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), named the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|best Chinese-language film]] at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]]. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] in 1949, previous and some foreign films were banned in 1951, and movie attendance increased sharply. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the "scar dramas" of the 1980s, such as ''[[Evening Rain]]'' (1980), ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' (1980) and ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984), the rise of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences, with films like ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' (1987), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) winning major international awards. The movement partially ended after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system and played mostly on the international film festival circuit.

Following the international commercial success of films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 [[List of highest-grossing films in China|highest-grossing films in China]] are domestic productions. ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach {{CNY|1 billion}} at the Chinese box office, ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) was the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}, ''[[The Mermaid (2016 film)|The Mermaid]]'' (2016) was the first to {{CNY|3 billion}} and ''[[Wolf Warriors 2|Wolf Warrior 2]]'' (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film in China.

[[Motion pictures]] were introduced to China in 1896. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China occurred in [[Shanghai]] on August 11, 1896, as an "act" on a variety bill.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Chris. "China Before 1949", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Chinese film, a recording of the [[Peking opera]], ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in November 1905 in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=Geiselmann&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/ueLK110_ChinFilmgesch/filmgeschichteSkript.pdf

In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in Shanghai by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC&amp;pg=PA1945 |title=East Asian Cinema |author= David Carter |publisher=Kamera Books |year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang Shichuan then set up the first Chinese-owned film production company in 1916. The first truly successful home-grown feature film was ''Yan Ruisheng'' ([[:zh:閻瑞生|閻瑞生]]) released in 1921. During the 1920s film technicians from the United States trained Chinese technicians in Shanghai, and American influence continued to be felt there for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

It was during this period that some of the more important production companies first came into being, notably [[Mingxing Film Company|Mingxing]] ("Star") and the Shaw brothers' [[Tianyi Film Company|Tianyi]] ("Unique"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, ''[[Laborer's Love]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name=Centennial&gt;{{cite web| url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| title = A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema| accessdate = 2007-04-26| author = Zhang Yingjin| date = 2003-10-10| publisher = University of California-San Diego| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907160026/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| archivedate = 2008-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | title = A Brief History of Chinese Film | accessdate = 2007-04-24 | publisher = Ohio State University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410062249/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | archivedate = 2014-04-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Chris.

===Leftist movement===
[[File:LoveandDuty.jpg|left|thumb|20-year-old [[Ruan Lingyu]], a superstar during the silent film era, in ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931).]]
However, the first truly important Chinese films were produced beginning in the 1930s, with the advent of the "progressive" or "left-wing" movement, like [[Cheng Bugao]]'s ''[[Spring Silkworms (film)|Spring Silkworms]]'' (1933), [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (1934), and [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]]'s ''[[The Big Road]]'' (1935). These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in ''Spring Silkworms'' and a prostitute in ''The Goddess''.&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema.&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.&lt;ref&gt;Laikwan Pang, ''Building a New China in Cinema'' (Rowman and Littlefield Productions, Oxford, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[production company|production companies]] dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua]] ("United China"),{{efn|Lianhua is also sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the "United Photoplay Service"}} the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/international/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archivedate = 2010-08-02 | title = Timeline | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | author = Kraicer, Shelly |date= 2005-12-06| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so),&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.

[[File:Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm.ogv|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[Children of Troubled Times]]'', a patriotic 1935 Chinese film most famous as the origin of "The March of the Volunteers", the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.]]

The period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as [[Hu Die]], [[Ruan Lingyu]], [[Li Lili]], [[Chen Yanyan]], [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Zhao Dan]] and [[Jin Yan]]. Other major films of the period include ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931), ''[[Little Toys]]'' (1933), ''[[New Women]]'' (1934), ''[[Song of the Fishermen]]'' (1934), ''[[Plunder of Peach and Plum]]'' (1934), ''[[Crossroads (1937 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1937), and ''[[Street Angel (1937 film)|Street Angel]]'' (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.

===Japanese occupation and World War II===

[[File:ZhouXuan1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Zhou Xuan]], an iconic Chinese singer and film actress.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, in particular the [[Battle of Shanghai]], ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except [[Xinhua Film Company]] ("New China") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to [[Hong Kong]], the wartime Nationalist capital [[Chongqing]], and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the "[[Solitary Island]]" period (also known as the "Sole Island" or "Orphan Island"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an "island" of production in the "sea" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director [[Bu Wancang]]'s ''[[Mulan Joins the Army (1939 film)|Mulan Joins the Army]]'' (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| title = Sole Island Movies| accessdate = 2006-08-18| author = Ministry of Culture Staff| year = 2003| publisher = ChinaCulture.org| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826094341/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| archivedate = 2006-08-26| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]-promoting ''[[Eternity (1943 film)|Eternity]]'' (1943) were produced.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt; At the end of [[World War II]], one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized company, [[Manchukuo Film Association]], would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baskett | first = Michael | year = 2008 | title = The Attractive Empire: Transnational Film Culture in Imperial Japan | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]] | location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3223-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4QfrTyvWEC |accessdate= 2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Golden Age==
[[File:New Fisherman's Song.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wang Danfeng]] in the film ''New Fisherman's Song'' (1942)]]

The film industry continued to develop after 1945. Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing had occupied in the previous decade. In 1946, [[Cai Chusheng]] returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the "Lianhua Film Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html#cai |title=Chinese Cinema - Cai Chusheng |accessdate=2007-04-25 |author=Zhang Yingjin |date=2007-01-01 |publisher=University of California-San Diego |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307193958/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html |archivedate=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn became [[Kunlun Film Company|Kunlun Studios]] which would go on to become one of the most important studios of the era, putting out the classics ''[[The Spring River Flows East]]'' (1947), ''[[Myriad of Lights]]'' (1948), ''[[Crows and Sparrows]]'' (1949) and ''[[San Mao, The Little Vagabond]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/13907 | title = Kunlun Film Company| accessdate = 2007-04-25| author = |year= 2004| publisher = British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist Party. ''The Spring River Flows East'', a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and [[Zheng Junli]], was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.

Meanwhile, companies like the [[Wenhua Film Company]] ("Culture Films"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, ''[[Unending Emotions]]'' (1947) and ''[[Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Pickowicz, Paul G. "Chinese Film-making on the Eve of the Communist Revolution", in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'', edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward (2011). BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable Wenhua film is ''[[Long Live the Missus]]'' (1947), like ''Unending Emotions'' with an original screenplay by writer [[Eileen Chang]]. Wenhua's romantic drama ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), a film by director [[Fei Mu]] shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html | title = Welcome to the Hong Kong Film Awards| accessdate = 2007-04-04 | author = |year= 2004| publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of "political grounding" that led to its labeling by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist victory]] in China in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Yingjin, "Introduction" in ''Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai, 1922–1943'', ed. Yingjin Zhang (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the China Film Archive's re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing ''Spring of the Small Town'' to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed [[Springtime in a Small Town|remake]] was made in 2002 by [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]. ''[[Remorse at Death]]'' (1948), by the same director, was the first Chinese [[Color motion picture film|color film]].

==Early Communist era==

With the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]] in 1949, the government saw motion pictures as an important mass production art form and tool for [[propaganda]]. Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and Hong Kong productions were banned as the [[Communist Party of China]] sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers and workers, such as ''[[Bridge (1949 film)|Bridge]]'' (1949) and ''[[The White Haired Girl (film)|The White Haired Girl]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"&gt;Yau, Esther. "China After the Revolution", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the production bases in the middle of all the transition was the [[Changchun Film Studio]].

The private studios in Shanghai, including Kunming, Wenhua, Guotai and Datong, were encouraged to make new films from 1949 to 1951. They made approximately 47 films during this period, but soon ran into trouble, owing to the furore over the Kunlun-produced drama ''[[The Life of Wu Xun]]'' (1950), directed by [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]] and starring veteran Zhao Dan. The feature was accused in an anonymous article in ''[[People's Daily]]'' in May 1951 of spreading feudal ideas. After the article was revealed to be penned by [[Mao Zedong]], the film was banned, a Film Steering Committee was formed to "re-educate" the film industry and within two years, these private studios were all incorporated into the state-run [[Shanghai Film Studio]].&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Julian 2011 p. 88"&gt;Ward, Julian.

BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist regime solved the problem of a lack of film theaters by building mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. By 1965 there were around 20,393 such units.&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"/&gt; The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory,&lt;ref name="Ward, Julian 2011 p. 88"/&gt; with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959.&lt;ref name="Bordwell and Thompson 2010 371"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17 years between the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and [[newsreel]]s were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/film/84966.htm | title = Film Industry in China | accessdate = 2007-02-27 | author = Li Xiao |date= 2004-01-17| publisher = China.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Guerrilla on the Railroad]]'' (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the primary resistance force against the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese in the war against invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yumi.

BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[widescreen]] Chinese film was produced in 1960. [[Animations|Animated films]] using a variety of [[Chinese folk art|folk arts]], such as [[Chinese paper art|papercuts]], [[shadow theatre|shadow plays]], [[glove puppetry|puppetry]], and [[Chinese painting|traditional paintings]], also were very popular for entertaining and educating children. The most famous of these, the classic ''[[Havoc in Heaven]]'' (two parts, 1961, 4), was made by [[Wan Laiming]] of the [[Wan Brothers]] and won Outstanding Film award at the [[London International Film Festival]].

The thawing of censorship in 1956–57 (known as the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]]) and the early 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of [[Lü Ban]]. ''[[Before the New Director Arrives]]'' exposes the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, while his next film, ''[[The Unfinished Comedy]]'' (1957), was labelled as a "poisonous weed" during the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] and Lü banned was from directing for life.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther.

BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;''The Unfinished Comedy'' was only screened after Mao's death.{{fact|date=November 2018}} Other noteworthy films produced during this period were adaptations of literary classics, such as [[Sang Hu]]'s ''[[The New Year's Sacrifice]]'' (1956; adapted from a [[Lu Xun]] story) and [[Shui Hua]]'s ''[[The Lin Family Shop]]'' (1959; adapted from a [[Mao Dun]] story). The most prominent filmmaker of this era was [[Xie Jin]], whose three films in particular, ''[[Woman Basketball Player No. 5]]'' (1957), ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1961 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'' (1961) and ''[[Two Stage Sisters]]'' (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time. Films made during this period are polished and exhibit high production value and elaborate sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Beijing]] and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957–60 the government built regional studios in [[Guangzhou]], [[Xi'an]] and [[Chengdu]] to encourage representations of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly address the issue of such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s, in films like ''[[Five Golden Flowers]]'' (1959), ''[[Third Sister Liu]]'' (1960), ''[[Serfs (1963 film)|Serfs]]'' (1963), ''[[Ashima (poem)|Ashima]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=370–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther.

==Cultural Revolution and its aftermath==
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted. Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called "revolutionary model operas". The most notable of these was a [[ballet]] version of the revolutionary opera ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1970 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the [[Gang of Four]] until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's ''[[Breaking with Old Ideas]]'', were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Yingjin &amp; Xiao, Zhiwei. "Breaking with Old Ideas" in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film''. Taylor &amp; Francis (1998), p. 101. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign [[film festival]]s sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and "exploratory" films like their counterparts in the West.

In the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and [[martial art]]s films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] to the newly formed [[Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television (China)|Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television]] to bring it under "stricter control and management" and to "strengthen supervision over production."

The end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of "scar dramas", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of "[[reform and opening up]]." For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] was given to two "scar dramas", ''[[Evening Rain]]'' ([[Wu Yonggang]], [[Wu Yigong]], 1980) and ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' ([[Xie Jin]], 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther. "China After the Revolution", in ''The Oxford history of world cinema'' edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. ''The Blue Kite'', though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.

==Rise of the Fifth Generation==
[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|A movie theater in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]]]]
Beginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the [[Beijing Film Academy]] in 1982 and included [[Zhang Yimou]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], [[Chen Kaige]], [[Zhang Junzhao]] and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the [[Cultural Revolution]] and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm | title = The Irresistible Rise of Asian Cinema-Tian Zhuangzhuang: A Director of the 21st Century| accessdate = 2007-04-23 |date= 2002-11-19 | author=Yvonne Ng|publisher = Kinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073506/http://kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the so-called [[scar literature]] in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation.{{efn|Notably Zhang Yimou served as cinematographer for both films.}} The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as ''[[King of the Children]]'' (1987), ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1989), ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western [[art film|arthouse]] audience. [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', the 1992 [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', the 1993 [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', and three [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] nominations from the Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=Greatfall/&gt; All these award-winning films starred actress [[Gong Li]], who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.

Diverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from [[black comedy]] ([[Huang Jianxin]]'s ''[[The Black Cannon Incident]]'', 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's ''[[Life on a String (film)|Life on a String]]'', 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include [[Wu Ziniu]], [[Hu Mei]], [[Li Shaohong]] and [[Zhou Xiaowen]]. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=639–640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.

These films came with a new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and [[long shot]]s. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=638–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. [[Wu Tianming]], in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the [[Xi'an Film Studio]] (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'' (1986) and ''[[The King of Masks]]'' (1996).

The Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Incident]], although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the [[United States]] (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for [[Australia]], while many others went into television-related works.

==Main melody dramas==
In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes "the main melody" (主旋律) to "invigorate national spirit and national pride".&lt;ref&gt;Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2008, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; These "main melody" films (主旋律电影), still produced regularly nowadays, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects.
They are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yomi. "Contemporary Mainstream PRC Cinema" in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'' (2011), edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward, BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August 1st Film Studio]], the film and TV production arm of the [[People's Liberation Army]], is a studio which produces "main melody" cinema. "Main melody" films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the [[Golden Rooster Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2008, p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more famous "main melody" dramas include the ten-hour epic ''[[Decisive Engagement]]'' (大决战, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; ''[[The Opium War (film)|The Opium War]]'' (1997), directed by [[Xie Jin]]; and ''[[The Founding of a Republic]]'' (2009), directed by [[Han Sanping]] and Fifth Generation director [[Huang Jianxin]].&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yomi. "Contemporary Mainstream PRC Cinema" in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'' (2011), edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward, BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth Generation==
The post-1990 era has seen what some observers{{Who|date=July 2011}} term the "return of the amateur filmmaker" as state [[censorship]] policies after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square demonstrations]] produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like [[16 mm film]] and [[digital video]] and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to [[Italian neorealism]] and [[cinéma vérité]] than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation.&lt;ref name=Greatfall&gt;Rose, S. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/01/china.film "The great fall of China"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2002-08-01. Retrieved on 2007-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion&lt;ref name="Stephen Teo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/feature-articles/li_yang/|title= "There Is No Sixth Generation!"

The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]]'s hand-held ''[[Beijing Bastards]]'' (1993) focuses on youth [[punk rock|punk]] [[subculture]], featuring artists like [[Cui Jian]], [[Dou Wei]] and [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] frowned upon by many state authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/1993/film/reviews/beijing-zazhong-1200433948/|title= Review: ‘Beijing Zazhong’|author= Deborah Young
|date= October 4, 1993|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work= Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jia Zhangke's debut film ''[[Xiao Wu]]'' (1997) concerns a provincial [[pickpocket]].

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'' (2000) was funded in part by [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s production house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2014/05/16/a-touch-of-sin-interview-with-jia-zhangke/|title= A Touch of Sin: Interview with Jia Zhang-ke|author= Pamela Jahn |date= May 16, 2014|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work= Electric Sheep}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''[[Still Life (2006 film)|Still Life]]'' was shot on [[High Definition video|HD video]]. ''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 [[Venice International Film Festival]]. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.

Many Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[market economy|market]]. [[Li Yang (director)|Li Yang]]'s ''[[Blind Shaft]]'' (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/movies/filming-the-dark-side-of-capitalism-in-china-578819.html | title = Filming the Dark Side Of Capitalism in China | accessdate = 2008-04-10 | author = Kahn, Joseph|date= 2003-05-07| publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation).&lt;ref name="Stephen Teo"/&gt; While Jia Zhangke's ''[[The World (film)|The World]]'' (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of [[globalization]] in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/festival-reports/new_york2004/ | title = Minimalism and Maximalism: The 42nd New York Film Festival | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | author = Rapfogel, Jared |date= December 2004| publisher = Senses of Cinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913090619/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/05/34/new_york2004.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are [[Wang Xiaoshuai]] (''[[The Days (film)|The Days]]'', ''[[Beijing Bicycle]]''), [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]] (''[[Beijing Bastards]]'', ''[[East Palace West Palace]]''), [[Jia Zhangke]] (''[[Xiao Wu]]'', ''[[Unknown Pleasures (film)|Unknown Pleasures]]'', ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'', ''[[The World (film)|The World]]''), [[He Jianjun]] (''[[Postman (film)|Postman]]'') and [[Lou Ye]] (''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]''). One young director who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is [[Lu Chuan]] (''[[Kekexili: Mountain Patrol]]'', 2004; ''[[City of Life and Death]]'', 2010).

==dGeneration Independent Movement==
There is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1219/719 |title=From D-Buffs to the D-Generation: Piracy, Cinema, and an Alternative Public Sphere in Urban China |website=Talari.com |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. [[Ying Liang]] and [[Jian Yi]] are two of these dGeneration filmmakers. Ying's ''[[Taking Father Home]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Other Half (2006 Chinese film)|The Other Half]]'' (2006) are both representative of the dGeneration trends of feature film. [[Liu Jiayin]] made two dGeneration feature films, ''[[Oxhide]]'' (2004) and ''[[Oxhide II]]'' (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. ''Oxhide'', made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film-Interviews__Features/28696/100-best-Chinese-Mainland-Films-the-countdown/9/30-21.html |title=100 best Chinese Mainland Films: the countdown |website=Timeoutbeijing.com |date=2014-04-04 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Documentary Movement==
Two decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. [[Wu Wenguang]]'s 70-minute ''[[Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers]]'' (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this "[[New Documentary Movement]]" (NDM) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/28/chinas_new_documentary/|title=Dancing with Myself,Drifting with My Camera: The Emotional Vagabonds|publisher=Senses of Cinema|author=Reynaud, Berenice|date=September 2003|accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202811/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/03/28/chinas_new_documentary.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/03/05/STYLE6967.dtl|author=Krich, John|publisher=''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''|date=March 5, 1998|title=China's New Documentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bumming'', made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in [[Beijing]], subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a [[camcorder]], the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chu | first = Yingchu| year = 2007 | title = Chinese Documentaries: From Dogma to Polyphony | publisher = Routledge| pages = 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dance with the Farm Workers]]'' (2001) is another documentary by Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zhang | first = Yingjin| year = 2010 | title = Cinema, Space, and Polylocality in a Globalizing China | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]]| page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another internationally acclaimed documentary is [[Wang Bing (director)|Wang Bing]]'s nine-hour tale of deindustrialization ''[[Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks]]'' (2003). Wang's subsequent documentaries, ''[[Fengming: A Chinese Memoir|He Fengming]]'' (2007), ''[[Crude Oil (film)|Crude Oil]]'' (2008), ''[[Man with no name (film)|Man with no name]]'' (2009), ''[[Three Sisters (2012 film)|Three Sisters]]'' (2012) and ''[[Til madness do us part|Feng ai]]'' (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Li Hong (filmmaker)|Li Hong]], the first woman in the NDM, in ''[[Out of Phoenix Bridge]]'' (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.

The New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. [[Xu Xin (filmmaker)|Xu Xin]]'s ''[[Karamay (film)|Karamay]]'' (2010), [[Zhao Liang (filmmaker)|Zhao Liang]]'s [[Behemoth (film 2015)|Behemoth]], [[Huang Weikai]]'s ''[[Disorder (2009 film)|Disorder]]'' (2009), [[Zhao Dayong]]'s ''[[Ghost Town (2009 film)|Ghost Town]]'' (2009), [[Du Haibing]]'s ''[[1428 (film)|1428]]'' (2009), [[Xu Tong]]'s ''[[Fortune Teller (2010 film)|Fortune Teller]]'' (2010) and [[Li Ning (filmmaker)|Li Ning]]’s ''[[Tape (2010)|Tape]]'' (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.

===Commercial successes===
With China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''[[The Horse Thief]]'' (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a [[Tibet]]an horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;''Celluloid China: cinematic encounters with culture and society'', Harry H. Kuoshu, Southern Illinois University Press (2002), p 202&lt;/ref&gt;
Tian's later ''[[The Warrior and the Wolf]]'' (2010) was a similar commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zx.dy.com.cn/content/2009-10-12/20091012185758575,1.shtml 《狼灾记》票房低迷出乎意料 导演的兽性情挑_第一电影网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905133933/http://zx.dy.com.cn/content/2009-10-12/20091012185758575%2C1.shtml |date=September 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film ''[[Romance on Lushan Mountain|Romance on the Lu Mountain]]'' (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the longest-running film on a [[first run (film)|first run]]. [[Jet Li]]'s cinematic debut ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]'' (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in [[Japan]] and the [[Southeast Asia]], for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Celebrity in China |authors= Louise Edwards, Elaine Jeffreys |publisher= Hong Kong University Press |year=2010 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful commercial film was ''[[Murder in 405]]'' (405谋杀案, 1980), a murder thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/ljsy_new/14/56/index.shtml|title=CCTV-电影频道-相聚——《流金岁月》|website=Cctv.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feng Xiaogang]]'s ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a ''[[hesui pian]]'' ([[Chinese New Year]]-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China's [[socialist market economy|socialist market]] society. Feng has become the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/02/feng-xiaogang-and-chinese-cinema-boom |title=Feng Xiaogang: the Chinese Spielberg |author= Walsh Megan|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work=[[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like [[Rosamund Kwan]], [[Jacqueline Wu]], [[Rene Liu]] and [[Shu Qi]] to boost his films' appeal.

In the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was pulled out from non-3D theaters for [[Hu Mei]]'s biopic ''[[Confucius (2010 film)|Confucius]]'', but this move led to a backlash on Hu's film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-01/29/content_9396402.htm |title=Confucius loses his way |author= Raymond Zhou|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Yang (director)|Zhang Yang]]'s 2005 ''[[Sunflower (2005 film)|Sunflower]]'' also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget ''[[Spicy Love Soup]]'' (1997) grossed ten times its budget of ¥3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Companion to Chinese Cinema |author= Yingjin Zhang (ed.) |publisher= Blackwell Publishing |year=2012 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the 2006 ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'', a [[sleeper hit]], was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009–11, Feng's ''[[Aftershock (2010 film)|Aftershock]]'' (2009) and [[Jiang Wen]]'s ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010) became China's highest grossing domestic films, with ''Aftershock'' earning ¥670 million (US$105 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/feng-xiaogang-remembering-1942-shanghai-338567 |title=Feng Xiaogang Unveils Epic 'Remembering 1942' at the Shanghai Film Festival |author= Karen Chu |date=2012-06-17|accessdate= 2012-07-07|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Let the Bullets Fly'' ¥674 million (US$110 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/so-young-enters-chinas-all-time-top-ten|title=So Young enters China's all-time top ten|author=Stephen Cremin|date=18 May 2013|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=April 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319110551/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/so-young-enters-chinas-all-time-top-ten|archivedate=19 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach [[Renminbi|¥]]1 billion at the Chinese box office and ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) became the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}.

===Other directors===
[[He Ping (director)|He Ping]] is a director of mostly [[Western film|Western]]-like films set in Chinese locale. His ''[[Swordsmen in Double Flag Town]]'' (1991) and ''[[Sun Valley (film)|Sun Valley]]'' (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the [[Gobi Desert]]. His [[historical drama]] ''[[Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker]]'' (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.

Recent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, [[Lü Yue]] made ''[[Mr. Zhao]]'' (1998), a [[black comedy]] film well received abroad. [[Gu Changwei]]'s [[minimalism|minimalist]] epic ''[[Peacock (2005 film)|Peacock]]'' (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Hou Yong (cinematographer)|Hou Yong]] is another cinematographer who made films (''[[Jasmine Women]]'', 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. [[Xu Jinglei]], a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004 film)|Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (2004) landed her the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]] Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is [[Zhao Wei]], whose directorial debut ''[[So Young (film)|So Young]]'' (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.

The most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly [[Jiang Wen]], who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]] held in [[Taiwan]]. His other films, like ''[[Devils on the Doorstep]]'' (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, ''Let the Bullets Fly'' had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.&lt;ref name="fba-resurrection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|work=Film Business Asia|title=Resurrection takes China BO record|accessdate=April 3, 2015|author=Cremin, Stephen|date=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730010234/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|archive-date=July 30, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20110216/000002.htm|title=《让子弹飞》票房7.3亿 姜文成国内第一导演_娱乐_腾讯网|website=Ent.qq.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese international cinema and successes abroad===
[[File:Jia Zhang-Ke Skipcity DCF 2005.jpg|thumb|150px|Director [[Jia Zhangke]] at the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival in Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan, 22 July 2005]]

Since the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of [[Ang Lee]]'s period [[wuxia|martial arts]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' which won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the [[wuxia]] genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date ''Crouching Tiger'' remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.

Similarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including [[Jet Li]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]]. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, ''Hero'' was a phenomenal success in most of [[Asia]] and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.

Other films such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', ''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' were critically acclaimed around the world. The [[Hengdian World Studios]] can be seen as the "Chinese Hollywood", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the [[Forbidden City]].

The successes of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and ''Hero'' make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between "Mainland Chinese" cinema and a more international-based "Chinese-language cinema". ''Crouching Tiger'', for example, was directed by a [[Taiwan]]-born American director ([[Ang Lee]]) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), Hong Kong ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), Taiwan ([[Chang Chen]]) and [[Malaysia]]n ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]]. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader [[East Asia]] and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005), ''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'' (2006), ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), ''[[The Warlords]]'' (2007), ''[[Bodyguards and Assassins]]'' (2009) and ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'' (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like [[Hu Jun]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Tang Wei]] and [[Zhou Xun]], obtained Hong Kong residency under the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]] and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |title=Zhou Xun Obtains Hong Kong Citizenship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2016-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402064516/http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to [[closet drama]], a '''closet screenplay''' is a screenplay intended not to be produced/performed but instead to be read by a solitary reader or, sometimes, out loud in a small group.

While any published, or simply read, screenplay might reasonably be considered a "closet screenplay," 20th- and 21st-century Japanese and Western writers have created a handful of film scripts expressly intended to be read rather than produced/performed. This class of [[prose fiction]] written in screenplay form is perhaps the most precise example of the closet screenplay.

This genre is sometimes referred to using a romanized [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[neologism]]: "Lesescenario (レーゼシナリオ)" or, following [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn’s romanization of Japanese]], sometimes “Rezeshinario.” A [[portmanteau]] of the German word ''Lesedrama'' ("read drama") and the English word ''scenario,'' this term simply means "closet scenario," or, by extension, "closet screenplay."&lt;ref&gt;''Sanseido's Concise Dictionary of [[Katakana]] Words''. Tokyo, [[Sanseido]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical interest==
Brian Norman, an [[assistant professor]] at [[Idaho State University]], refers to [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s ''[[One Day When I Was Lost]]'' as a "closet [[screenplay]]."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Brian. “Reading a ‘Closet Screenplay’: Hollywood, James Baldwin’s Malcolms, and the Threat of Historical Irrelevance." ''[[African American Review]]'' 39.1-2 (Spring/Summer 2005): 10-18.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_1-2_39/ai_n15675152]&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was written for a project to produce a movie, but the project suffered a setback. After that, the script was published as a [[literary work]].

[[Lee Jamieson]]'s article "The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The Film Theory of [[Antonin Artaud]]"&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Lee. “The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The Film Theory of Antonin Artaud" ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' 44 (27 August 2007).[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2007/feature-articles/film-theory-antonin-artaud/]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses Artaud's three Lesescenarios (listed below) in the context of his "revolutionary film theory." And in ''French Film Theory and Criticism: 1907–1939'',&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Richard. ''French Film Theory and Criticism: 1907–1939'' (Princeton UP, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Abel lists the following critical treatments of several of the Surrealist "published scenario texts" (36) listed in the example section below:

* J. H. Matthews, ''Surrealism and Film'' (U of Michigan P, 1971), 51–76.
* Steven Kovács, ''From Enchantment to Rage: The Story of Surrealist Cinema'' (Associated UP, 1980), 59–61, 157–76.
* Linda Williams, ''Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film'' (U of Illinois P, 1981), 25–33.
* Richard Abel, "Exploring the Discursive Field of the Surrealist Film Scenario Text," ''Dada/Surrealism'' 15 (1986): 58–71.

Finally, in his article "Production's 'dubious advantage': Lesescenarios, closet drama, and the (screen)writer's riposte,"&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Quimby. January 2010. "Production's 'dubious advantage': Lesescenarios, closet drama, and the (screen)writer's riposte." [http://scriptjr.nl SCRIPTjr.nl] 1.1. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed November 21, 2009) [http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Quimby Melton outlines the history of the Lesescenario form, situates the genre in a historical literary context by drawing parallels between it and Western "[[closet drama]]," and argues we might consider certain instances of closet drama proto-screenplays. The article also argues that writing these sorts of "readerly" performance texts is essentially an act of subversion whereby (screen)writers work in a performance mode only to intentionally bypass production and, thereby, (re)assert narrative representation's textual primacy and (re)claim a direct (re)connection with their audience.

The comments section of Melton's article also has an ongoing discussion of the Lesescenario canon.[http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php#comments] The list of examples below is based on "Production's 'dubious advantage,'" that discussion, and Melton's "Lesecenario Bibliography" at Google Docs.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Quimby. 6 February 2011.

Google Docs. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARA6WIHgRcNMZGM2OGJxNWhfMjlmeHh0NHZnbg&amp;hl=en&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed February 06, 2011) [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARA6WIHgRcNMZGM2OGJxNWhfMjlmeHh0NHZnbg&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography contains additional critical works concerned with individual Lesescenarios and/or the canon at large.

'''Copyright for Creativity - A Declaration for Europe'''  issued on 5 May 2010, is intended as a statement of how [[copyright]] [[policy]] could be constructed in the Internet Age. It comes against the background of political debate within Europe to rethink [[copyright]] in an era where the use of digital content without paying fees to the creators is part of the business model for some of the largest global internet platforms. Interests of content creators and online platform providers collide. The declaration has been written by a group from political party "[[European People's Party|European People's Party (EPP)]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12101.htm] Rethinking Creative Rights for the Internet age.

'''Copyright for Creativity – A Declaration for Europe'''

''"Humanity's capacity to generate new ideas and knowledge is its greatest asset. It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development."''
Adelphi Charter

The development of new technologies underpinning the [[knowledge economy]] calls for a review of the copyright aquis. Together, we need to create greater incentives to maximise creativity, innovation, education and access to culture, and secure Europe's competitiveness.

Exclusive rights stimulate investment and the production of cultural and knowledge based goods. Simultaneously, exceptions* to those rights create a balanced system that allow for the use of creative works to support innovation, creation, competition and the public interest. Well-crafted exceptions can serve both goals: preserving rewards and incentives for creators while also encouraging innovative re-uses that benefit the public.

While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy, copyright's exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment.

Europe requires a balanced, flexible and harmonised system of exceptions that is in step with the 21st Century knowledge economy. The European Commission took a first step with the publication of the Green Paper, "Copyright in the Knowledge Economy." The signatories of this declaration call upon the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States to take this Declaration into account and engage in policy and norm-setting on copyright exceptions to:

* '''Harmonise Exceptions Across Europe.''' Copyright regulates the flow of consumer as well as knowledge goods in the single market. For European citizens and industry alike, the harmonisation of exceptions is a necessary step to facilitate cross-border trade, and create equality and clarity before the law.
* '''Act as a Spur to Innovation:''' New technologies make it possible to expand users' access to vast quantities of relevant knowledge and content. Copyright exceptions must support the development and usage of these innovative services, improving European users' access to content.
*'''Support User Creativity and Wider Participation:''' The Internet has facilitated an unprecedented shift for citizens, from being passive consumers of "broadcast" culture to active creators and participants. Individual users are increasingly involved in content and knowledge creation. The European copyright framework needs to reflect this new interactivity which encourages creativity, cultural diversity and self-expression.
*''' Ensure Accessibility by all Europeans:''' Exceptions must balance the protection of the creators' rights with the public interest and must fully support improving access to knowledge and content for people with disabilities – most notably through the use of new technologies.
*''' Support for Education and Research:''' Information and communication technologies offer new collaborative ways to develop and share educational and research materials.Copyright exceptions that facilitate new technology-based research and education will propel science and learning, and therefore the knowledge economy, exponentially forward.
*'''Facilitate Preservation and Archiving:''' Digitisation of content is offering new opportunities not only to preserve but also extend the accessibility of Europe's knowledge and cultural heritage with wide-reaching and long-term benefits for society as a whole. The copyright framework must support this.
*'''Ensure Monopoly Rights are Regulated in the Online Environment:''' Limitations and exceptions act to counterbalance the lack of competition that is created by the granting of monopoly rights in copyright law. In order to protect creativity and innovation we must ensure that these monopoly rights are also regulated in the online environment.
*'''Promote these Principles in International Discussions.''' The principles and objectives we endorse should not apply only to Europeans – they should be at the centre of the EU's contributions in any discussions in multilateral and bilateral fora it participates in.

''* Copyright law enable an exclusive right to creators to regulate and control the use of their work as they wish. Limitations and exceptions balance the monopoly right of the creator, in the public interest. For example to promote education and learning, support a free press, deal with market failure etc.''{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''''Crossing the Water''''' is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by [[Sylvia Plath]] that was prepared for publication by [[Ted Hughes]]. These are transitional poems that were written along with the poems that appear in her poetic opus, ''Ariel''. The collection was published in the United Kingdom by Faber &amp; Faber (1975) and in the United States by Harper &amp; Row (1976).

The poems here tend to dwell on one's state of being in an environment. "Wuthering Heights," for example, details a walk that Plath takes along the Yorkshire moors where [[Emily Brontë]] once trekked, Finisterre is a stormy island where Plath and her family once visited and "Among the Narcissi" describes Plath's similarities at being among asexual vegetation.

'''''Deep Rivers''''' ({{lang-es|'''Los ríos profundos'''}}) is the third novel by Peruvian writer [[José María Arguedas]]. It was published by Losada in Buenos Aires in 1958, received the Peruvian National Culture Award (Premio Nacional de Cultura) in 1959, and was a finalist in the William Faulkner Foundation Ibo-American award (1963). Since then, critical interest in the work of Arguedas has grown, and the book has been translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa 1996, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, this novel marked the beginning of the current neo-indigenista movement, which presented, for the first time, a reading of indigenous issues from a closer perspective. Most critics agree that this novel is one of Arguedas' masterpieces.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

The title of the work ('Uku Mayu' in Quechua) alludes to the depth of the Andean rivers, which rise in the top of the Andes. It also relates to the solid and ancestral roots of Andean culture, which, according to Arguedas, are the true national identity of Peru.

==Context==

The last years of the 1950s were very fertile for Arguedas' literary production. The book appeared when Indigenismo was in full swing in Peru. Education Minister at the time, Luis E. Valcárcel, organized the Culture Museum, an institution that contributed decisively to indigenous studies. Moreover, with the publication of Deep Rivers, the growing reception to Arguedas' work began, both in Peru and throughout the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Tapia Soriano: Guía de lectura de ''El Comercio'', Nº 19, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

The genesis of the novel was the story 'Warma kuyay" (part of the collection of short stories entitled 'Water', published in 1935), one of whose characters is the child Ernesto. This Ernesto is unmistakably the same as the Deep Rivers character. A text of Arguedas which was published in 1948 in the form of autobiography (Las Moradas, vol. II, No. 4, Lima, April 1948, pp. 53-59), took shape as the second chapter of the novel under the title 'Los Viajes'. In 1950 Arguedas wrote the essay 'The novel and the problem of literary expression in Peru' (La novela y el problema de la expresion literaria en el Peru), in which he announced the existence of the novel project. The push to complete the novel emerged years later in 1956, while conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the Mantaro Valley. He then worked hard to its completion. Some texts of ethnographic study were attached to the story, such as the etymological explanation of 'zumbayllu' or magical spinning top.

==Plot==

The novel describes the maturation process of Ernesto, a 14-year-old who must confront the injustices of the adult world that he becomes a part of, and who is required to take sides. The story begins in Cuzco, where Ernesto and his father Gabriel arrive. Gabriel, an itinerant lawyer, is looking for a rich relative called 'El Viejo' (the old one), in order to ask for work and shelter. But he does not succeed. He then recommences his wanderings through many cities and villages of southern Peru. In Abancay, Ernesto is enrolled as a boarder at a religious school while his father continues his travels in search of work.

Ernesto then has to live with the boarding students who are a microcosm of Peruvian society and where cruel and violent behaviour is the norm. Later, outside the boundaries of the school, a group of [[chicha|chicheras]] mutiny, demanding the distribution of salt, and a mass of Indian peasants enter the city to ask for a mass for the victims of epidemic typhus. This pushes Ernesto into a profound awareness: he must choose the values of liberation rather than economic security. This completes a phase of the learning process. The novel ends when Ernesto leaves Abancay and goes to a ranch owned by "El Viejo", situated in the valley of the Apurimac, awaiting the return of his father.

==Analysis==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With deep rivers Arguedas's work reached a wide continental distribution. This novel fully develops the lyrical potentialities that lay in Arguedas' prose from the beginning. Offering the story from the perspective of an introverted teenage character, to some extent autobiographical, this narrative of internal examination presents however, from its first line, a distressing reflection on reality, on the nature of the Andean world and its relations with westernized sectors. One of the merits of Deep Rivers is its achievement of a high degree of consistency between the two facets of the text. With regard to the revelation of the meaning of the Indian reality, Deep Rivers repeats certain dimensions of Yawar Fiesta, Arguedas's previous novel: its contextualization within the Andean, the emphasis on the opposition between such a universe and the coastal one, the assertion of power and the Quechua people of the Andean culture, etc. The chapters recounting the revolt of the chicheras and settlers insist on showing that hidden capacity. Arguedas liked to point out that the action of the settlers, although treated in the novel as magical motivations, foreshadowed the peasant uprisings that occurred in reality a few years later. The subjective side of Deep Rivers is focused on the efforts of the protagonist to understand the world around him, and to place himself within it as a living whole. Such a project is in extreme conflict: on one hand, on the level of subjectivity, a mythical vision of indigenous descent affirming the unity of the universe and the sharing of all items in a harmonious destiny works; on the other hand, contrary to the above, the experience of immediate reality highlights the deep division in the world and its history of tears and strife, stories that force the protagonist to choose in favor of one side of reality and fight against the other. His ideal of integration, a most passionate one, as it originates in his fragmented interiority, is doomed to failure. To participate in the world is not to live in harmony; it is exactly the opposite, to internalize the conflicts of reality. This is the hard lesson that Deep Rivers chronicles. On the other hand, in order to capture the double movement of convergence and dispersion, or unity and disharmony, this novel builds a dense and beautiful symbolic system that creatively retells certain indigenous myths and gives them fresh life. In this respect the novel functions as a dazzling lyrical operation. Deep Rivers is not the most important work of Arguedas; it is however, without a doubt, the most beautiful and perfect."&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cornejo Polar, pp. 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Style and Narrative Technique==

Mario Vargas Llosa, who along with Carlos Eduardo Zavaleta was the first to develop the "modern novel" in Peru, recognizes that Arguedas, although not developing modern techniques in his narratives, is nevertheless much more modern than other writers who respond to the characteristic nineteenth century classical model, that of the "traditional novel", as in the case of Ciro Alegría. Vargas Llosa says of it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With the stories Agua (Water) and Los rios profundos (Deep Rivers), after the progress he had made Yawar Fiesta, Arguedas had perfected his style as much as his technical resources, which, without spectacular innovations or experimental daring, still reached full functionality in this novel. That persuasive power, without which no fiction can live, endows the story before the reader not pass the test of time."&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa 1996, pp. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vargas Llosa recognizes the emotional impact reading Deep Rivers left him, which unambiguously qualifies it as a masterpiece.

Vargas Llosa also highlights Arguedas mastery of the Spanish language in this novel to reach a style of great artistic effectiveness. It is a functional and flexible Spanish, which brings to light the different shades of a plurality of issues, people and peculiarities of the world exposed in the work.

Arguedas, a bilingual writer, succeeds in "quechuization" of Spanish: what some characters say in Quechua is translated to Spanish, sometimes including those speeches in italics in the original language. This does not happen often, but as often as needed to make the reader see that these are two cultures with two different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa 1996, pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The zumbayllu==

The zumbayllu or spinning top is the quintessential magical element of the novel. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ball (of the top) was made of a store-bought coconut, from those tiny grey coconuts that come in cans; the spike was large and thin. Four round holes, like eyes, emanated from the sphere."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These holes produce the typical buzzing sound when spun, which give the object its name. There is also a more powerful type of zumbayllu made from a deformed object but without being round (winku) and with the quality of sorcery (layka). 

For Ernesto, the zumbayllu is the ideal instrument for capturing the interplay between objects. As such, its functions are varied, but it is first used to send messages to distant places. Ernesto believes that his voice can reach the ears of his absent father by chanting the zumbayllu. It is also a pacifying object, a symbol of restoring order, as in the episode where Ernesto gives his zumbayllu to Anauco. But it is also a purifying element of negative spaces, and it is under that belief that Ernesto buries his zumbayllu in the backyard of the toilets, in the same place where older inmates sexually abused a mentally disabled woman. The zumbayllu purifies the land and flowers start to sprout, which Ernesto then decides to place in the woman's tomb.

The word '''diorama''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|m|ə}} can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as [[Model military vehicle|military vehicle modeling]], [[Model figure|miniature figure modeling]], or [[Model airplane|aircraft modeling]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word "diorama" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means "through that which is seen", from the [[greek language|Greek]] di- "through" + orama "that which is seen, a sight". The diorama was invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]], first exhibited in [[Paris]] in July 1822 and in [[London]] on September 29, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|Diorama Theatres - Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2017}} The meaning "small-scale replica of a scene, etc." is from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/diorama Diorama - Word Origin &amp; History] - Online Etymology Dictionary - ''Dictionary.com''. Retrieved 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.

== The modern diorama ==
[[File:Cooling tower construction diorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cooling tower]] construction diorama]]
The current, popular understanding of the term "diorama" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or [[scale model]] of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.

One of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where the [[Biological museum (Stockholm)|Biological Museum]] opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. 

===Miniatures===
Miniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] to display [[Rail transport|railroading]]. This diorama employs a common [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] scale of 1:87 ([[HO scale]]). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.

An early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer. [[William Siborne]], and represents the [[Battle of Waterloo]] at about 7.45 pm, on 18 June, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1975-05-56-1 |title=Model of the field of Waterloo with troops positioned as at 19.45 hours, 18 June 1815. |publisher=National Army Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama measures {{convert|8.33|by|6|m}} and used around 70,000 model soldiers in its construction. It is now part of the collection of the [[National Army Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waterloo200.org/200-object/captain-sibornes-model-of-waterloo/ |title=Captain Siborne’s Model of Waterloo |website=Waterloo 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheperd Paine]], a prominent hobbyist, popularized the modern miniature diorama beginning in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Full size dioramas ===
[[Image:DSC01677 Diorama isole Lofoten - Museo di storia naturale, Milano - Foto di G. Dall'Orto - 20-12-2006.jpg|thumbnail|A diorama in the Museum of Natural History in [[Milan]] (Italy)]]

Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the [[illusion]] through [[depth perception]] in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the [[binocular disparity|binocular perception]] of depth.

=== Uses ===

[[Image:GenealogicalDiorama.jpg|thumb|A [[genealogy|genealogical]] diorama for an elementary school class project; the featured subject is a maternal great-grandfather of the student]]

Miniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Landscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.

Hobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including [[plastic model]]s of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.

In the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.

One of the largest dioramas ever created{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} was a model of the entire State of [[California]] built for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]].

Dioramas are widely used in the [[American educational system]], mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological [[biomes]], cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a [[trompe-l'œil]] in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.

==Historic dioramas==
===The Daguerre and Bouton Dioramas===
[[File:Diorama diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823, by A. Pugin and J. Morgan (illustration reproduced from Gernsheim 1968, p 21)]]
The Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular "[[Panorama]]" ([[panoramic painting]]), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.

The size of the [[proscenium]] was {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|21|ft|m}} high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.

The inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were [[Charles Marie Bouton|Charles-Marie Bouton]] (1781– 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre Prévost, and [[Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre]] (1787–1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the [[daguerreotype]], the first widely used method of [[photography]].

A second Diorama building in [[Regent's Park]] in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_1_1.htm|title=The Diorama in Great Britain by R.

The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Lambourne, ''Victorian Painting'', London, Phaidon Press, 1999; p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town [[Bry-sur-Marne]], where he lived and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/sites/bry/fichier/diaporama_diorama.pdf All about Daguerre's diorama in Bry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/bry/2308.htm About the diorama on Bry's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gottstein Dioramas ===
Until 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum, (formerly the [[Banqueting House]]), in [[Whitehall]]. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout [[England]], some ending up in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892–1951) of [[Leipzig]], a Jewish immigrant from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Germany]], who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of [[Kiel]], Biebel of [[Berlin]] and Muller of [[Erfurt]], all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both [[Germany]] and [[France]] to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.

# The Landing of the Romans under [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 B.C.
# The [[Battle of Hastings]].
# The Storming of [[Siege of Acre (1189–91) | Acre]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Battle of Crecy]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].
# The [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reviewing her troops at [[Tilbury]].
# The [[Battle of Marston Moor]].
# The [[Battle of Blenheim]]. (Painted by Douchkine.)
# The [[Battle of Plessey]].
# The [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]]. (Engraved by Krunert of Vienna.)
# The [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].
# The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].
# The [[Battle of Ulundi]]. (figures by Ochel, and Petrocochino - ''pseudonym of Paul Armont''.)
# The Battle of Fleurs.
# The [[D-Day landings]].

Krunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for ''‘The Battle of Quebec’''. Unfortunately, the ''‘death of Wolfe’'' was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian émigré who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] on horseback for ''‘The Blenheim Diorama’'', one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.

Denny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the [[Ancient Britons]], the [[Normans]] and [[Saxons]], some of the figures of ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' and the [[Elizabethan]] figures for ''‘Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury’''. Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the ''‘Battle of Blenheim’'' diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures, this diorama representing the ''‘D-Day landings’''. When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the [[Glenbow Museum]], (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: '''The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.''
 
The state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (''The World of Model Soldiers'') claimed in 1968, that the dioramas "appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) "the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. ''‘The Battle of Hastings’'' diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, [[Hastings]], and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up [[Senlac Hill]] towards the Saxon lines. 
'‘The Storming of Acre’'' is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, [[Woolwich]]. John Garratt, in the "Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers", states that ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' was in the possession of the [[Royal Military School of Music]], [[Kneller Hall]]; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the British Flat Figure Society'': Issue One – April 1986.

===The Frank Wong dioramas===

[[San Francisco, California]] artist '''Frank Wong''' (born 22 September 1932) created [[Dioramas|miniature dioramas]] that depict the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]] of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = sfchron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Julian|title=Frank Wong recalls life in Chinatown through miniature dioramas|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Frank-Wong-recalls-life-in-Chinatown-through-5706947.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other dioramas ===
[[File:Battle of Midway.jpg|thumb|This photorealistic diorama of the [[Battle of Midway]] was created during World War II on the basis of information then available.]]
Painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era like [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Francis Danby]] were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as "Mad Martin," set fire to the roof of [[York Minster]]. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a "safe fire" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the "safe" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.

A small scale version of the diorama called the [[Polyrama Panoptique]] could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302430&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library: the collections of the Science Museum, the National Railway Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history dioramas==
Natural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to "nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/ Diorama Exhibition at the American Natural History Museum] – Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, Nature’s Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by [[Charles Willson Peale]], an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale "painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the [[British Museum]] held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.

The first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]] for the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator [[Frank M. Chapman]], Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for [[habitat conservation]]. The modern [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York,. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist [[Martha Maxwell]], created a famous habitat diorama for the [[Centennial Exposition|first World's Fair]] in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as   Akeley and [[William Temple Hornaday]].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; 

Soon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; though some would be donated by game hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hanson, Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the [[American Museum of Natural History#African Mammal Hall|Akeley Hall of African Mammals]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.

===Constructing a diorama===

Natural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:

#The painted background
#The foreground
#Taxidermy specimens

Preparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.

The foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.

Taxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mâché mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.

If an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.

[[File:Apocalyptic Scene - illuminated manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Apocalyptic Scene'', [[Saint Louis Art Museum]]]]

Illustrated [[Apocalypse]] manuscripts are [[manuscript]]s that contain the text of [[Revelation]] or a commentary on Revelation and also illustrations. Many of the more famous Apocalypse manuscripts were made in [[England]] c. 1250-1400.    

[[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]] and [[Léopold Delisle]], in their book ''L'Apocalypse en français au XIIIe siècle (Paris MS fr. 403)'', 2 vols., Paris, 1900-01, were the first scholars to try to list, describe and categorise the English Apocalypse manuscripts.  

[[Montague Rhodes James|M. R. James]] also wrote about illustrated Apocalypse manuscripts in his book ''The Apocalypse in Art'', London, 1931.

Since M. R. James' work, there have been a number of more recent studies by R. Freyhan, George Henderson, Peter Klein, Suzanne Lewis, Nigel Morgan and Lucy Sandler.

These manuscripts can be divided by the language and form of the Apocalypse text. Many manuscripts have a [[Latin]] text, others have an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] prose text and others have a [[French language|French]] verse text combined with a Latin text. Two manuscripts do not have a separate text, but incorporate excerpts from the text into the illustrations.

The illustrations can be divided into several different [[iconography|iconographic]] groups. The manuscripts with a Latin text all belong to the same iconographic family. With a few exceptions, this is also true of the manuscripts with the French prose texts and also with the French verse-Latin texts.

[[File:Francis Burnand.png|thumb|right|250px|From ''The History of [[Punch (magazine)|"Punch"]]'']]
'''Sir Francis Cowley Burnand''' (29 November 1836 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1917), usually known as '''F. C. Burnand''', was an English comic writer and prolific playwright, best known today as the librettist of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s opera ''[[Cox and Box]]''.

The son of a prosperous family, he was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and was expected to follow a conventional career in the law or in the church, but he concluded that his vocation was the theatre. From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 until the end of the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 [[Victorian burlesque]]s, [[farces]], [[pantomime]]s and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques ''Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863) and ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'' (1866).  Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'' as a comic opera, ''Cox and Box'', with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.

By the 1870s, Burnand was generating a prodigious output of plays as well as comic pieces and illustrations for the humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. Among his 55-stage works during the decade was another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879). For ''Punch'', among other things, he wrote the popular column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. Also admired were his burlesques of other writers' works. Burnand was a contributor to ''Punch'' for 45 years and its editor from 1880 until 1906 and is credited with adding much to the popularity and prosperity of the magazine. His editorship of the original publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] and [[Weedon Grossmith]] was a high point of his tenure in 1888–89. Many of his articles were collected and published in book form. His stage successes in the 1890s included his English-language versions of two [[Edmond Audran]] operettas, titled ''La Cigale'' and ''Miss Decima'' (both in 1891). His last works included collaborations on pantomimes of ''[[Cinderella]]'' (1905) and ''Aladdin'' (1909).

Known generally for his genial wit and good humor, Burnand was nevertheless intensely envious of his contemporary [[W. S. Gilbert]] but was unable to emulate his rival's success as a comic opera librettist. In other forms of theatre Burnand was outstandingly successful, with his works receiving London runs of up to 550 performances and extensive tours in the British provinces and the US.  He published several humorous books and memoirs and was knighted in 1902 for his work on ''Punch''.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Burnand was born in central London, the only child of Francis Burnand and his first wife Emma, ''née'' Cowley, who died when her son was eight days old.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 8 June 2014, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32183}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand senior, a stockbroker, was descended from an old [[Savoy]]ard family, prominent in the silk trade; his wife was a descendant of the poet and dramatist [[Hannah Cowley]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Burnand was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where, aged fifteen, he wrote a [[farce]], ''Guy Fawkes Day'', played at [[William Cookesley|Cookesley]]'s house, and subsequently at the Theatre Royal, [[Worthing]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U194179 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], ''Who Was Who'', online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014, accessed 7 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While at Eton, he submitted some illustrations to the comic weekly magazine, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', one or two of which were published. In 1854 he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where as an undergraduate he sought the approval of the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], [[Edwin Guest]], of the establishment of a [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]], with a performance of ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt; Guest and his colleagues refused their consent, but Burnand went ahead without it. The members of the club performed a triple bill under stage names to avoid retribution from the university. The club prospered (and continues to the present day); Burnand acted and wrote plays under the name Tom Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand graduated in 1858. His family had expected that he would study for the [[Barrister|bar]], but the Burnands held the right to appoint the [[vicar|incumbent]] of a [[Church of England]] parish that became vacant, and it was agreed that he should train for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=aam&gt;Milne, A. A. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Archive, Oxford University Press, 1927, accessed 8 June 2014 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon|Cuddesdon]] theological college, where his studies of divinity led him to leave the Anglican church and become a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; This caused a breach between Burnand and his father, but the estrangement did not last long. To the disappointment of [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], leader of the English Catholics, Burnand announced that his vocation was not for the church but for the theatre.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; Father and son were reconciled, and Burnand returned to his original plan of reading for the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Death of Sir Francis Burnand", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 April 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860s: start of writing career===
[[File:F C Burnand Charicatures Shakespeare.png|right|thumb|upright|Burnand as Mr Punch, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'''s mascot]]
In February 1860 Burnand had his first piece performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]], ''Dido the Celebrated Widow'', a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', played at the [[St James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=nicoll288&gt;Nicoll, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841–1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. He was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1862, and practised for a short time, but his main interest was in writing. In the early 1860s, he edited the short-lived journal ''The Glow-Worm'' and then joined the staff of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', edited by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]. He parted company with Byron when the magazine rejected his proposed 1863 [[burlesque (literary)|literary burlesque]] of a [[George W. M. Reynolds|Reynolds]] serial, entitled ''Mokeanna, or the White Witness''. He showed his manuscript to [[Mark Lemon]], editor of ''Punch'', who accepted it for publication; Burnand remained a ''Punch'' writer for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;{{refn|[[W. S. Gilbert]], later Burnand's rival as a comic playwright, made the opposite journey, severing his connection with ''Punch'' in favour of ''Fun'' when Lemon turned down one of Gilbert's ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Great English Humorists – Gilbert and Burnand", ''The Times'', 18 November 1936, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

''Dido'' was followed by ''The Îles of St Tropez'' (1860), ''Fair Rosamond'' (1862) and ''The Deal Boatman'' (1863), among many others.&lt;ref name=Parker84&gt;Parker, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, ''[[Ixion]], or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863), starring [[Lydia Thompson]] in the title role, which found audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For ''Ixion'' this brought him a total of around £3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early works included an [[opéra bouffe]], ''Windsor Castle'' (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including ''[[Helen of Troy|Helen]], or, Taken from the Greek'', and ''[[Guy Fawkes]], or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons'', both in 1866.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', parodying the three-act melodrama by [[Douglas Jerrold]], ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'';&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ts5ZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 "''The Morning Post''"], ''Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', review in ''The Morning Post'', digitized by The British Library (2013), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; the show ran for 400 nights at the [[Royalty Theatre]], was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt;

[[File:Black eyed See-Usan - Weir Collection.jpg|upright|thumb|Theatre poster for Burnard's ''Black Eyed See-Usan'']]
In 1866, Burnand adapted the popular farce ''Box and Cox'' as a [[comic opera]], ''[[Cox and Box]]'', with music by the young composer [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The piece was written for a private performance but was repeated and given its first public performance at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Cox and Box" &amp;ndash; A Postscript", ''The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Journal'', 1968, volume IX, 7, pp.132–133; and "Adelphi Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 May 1867, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''Fun'' was [[W. S. Gilbert]], who wrote
{{quote|Mr Sullivan's music is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded. It is very funny, here and there, and grand or graceful when it is not funny; but the grand and the graceful have, we think, too large a share of the honours to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
''Cox and Box'' became a popular favourite and was frequently revived.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Royal Gallery of Illustration]]", ''The Times'', 30 March 1869, p. 10 "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 15 July 1880, p. 6; "Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 March 1895, p. 12; and "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 25 August 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only work not by Gilbert in the regular repertory of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] during the 20th century and is the only work of Burnand's still frequently staged.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15, 140–186 and xxv–xxvi; and [http://www.gloc.org/#/cox-and-box/4584711461 "Cox and Box on tour"], [[Grosvenor Light Opera Company]], accessed 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46774. "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 8 July 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success encouraged its authors to write the two-act opera, ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), revised and expanded as ''[[The Chieftain]]'' (1894), but it did not achieve much popularity in either version.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 62; and Rollins and Witts, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

More burlesques followed in 1868, including ''Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard'' and ''The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1869, Burnand wrote ''The Turn of the Tide'', which was a success at the [[Queen's Theatre]], and six other stage works during the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

===1870s: prolific author===
[[File:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 61.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Burnand, c. 1870s]]
Burnand's wife Cecilia died in 1870 at age 28, leaving him with seven small children. In 1874 Burnand married her widowed sister, Rosina (d. 1924), who was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp89208/rosina-nee-ranoe-lady-burnand "Rosina (née Ranoe), Lady Burnand"], National Portrait Gallery, accessed 9 July 2014. She had appeared in, among other things, Burnand's ''Black-Eyed Susan'' and Gilbert's ''[[An Old Score]]'', and had performed together with her sister and Burnand in Burnand's one-act burlesque of ''[[The Odyssey]]'', [http://www.mocavo.com/Sir-Charles-Wyndham-a-Biography-2/116574/59#62 ''Patient Penelope; or, The Return of Ulysses''].&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time illegal in England for a man to marry his dead wife's sister,{{refn|This became legal in 1907 under the [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]].|group=n}} although such marriages made outside British jurisdiction were recognised as valid; accordingly the wedding ceremony was performed in continental Europe. There were two sons and four daughters of this marriage.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Throughout the 1870s, Burnand maintained a prodigious output. For the stage he wrote 55 pieces, ranging from burlesques to [[pantomime]]s, farces and [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref name=nicoll289&gt;Nicoll, pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sole author of most of them, but worked on a few with [[Thomas German Reed]], [[James Lynam Molloy|J. L. Molloy]], [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] and even with H. J. Byron.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; His stage pieces of the 1870s included ''Poll and Partner Joe'' (1871),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Penelope Anne'' (1871; a sequel to ''Cox and Box''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''The Miller and His Man'' (1873; "a Christmas drawing room extravaganza" with songs by Sullivan),&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/miller/index.html ''The Miller and His Man''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artful Cards'' (1877),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Proof'' (1878),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Dora and Diplunacy'' (1878, a burlesque of [[Clement Scott]]'s ''Diplomacy'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]]'s ''Dora''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' (1878; a charity collaboration among four playwrights, including Byron and Gilbert),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Our Club'' (1878)&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; and another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879).&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He provided a burlesque of ''Robbing Roy'' to the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''The Times'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand's prolific writing came at some cost in quality. A biographer wrote that he "was a facile and slapdash writer. False rhymes and awkward rhythms occur frequently in his verse, and his favourite devices included puns, topical references and slang."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Burnand also translated or adapted for the London stage several French operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Edmond Audran]], [[Charles Lecocq]] and [[Robert Planquette]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; At the same time as his busy theatrical career, he was a member of the staff of ''Punch'' under Lemon and his successors, [[Shirley Brooks]] and [[Tom Taylor]], writing a regular stream of genial articles.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; His best-known work for the magazine was the column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. [[A. A. Milne]] considered it "one of the most popular series which has ever appeared in ''Punch''"; alongside it, he rated as Burnand's best comic contributions his burlesques of other writers, such as "The New History of Sandford and Merton" (1872) and "Strapmore" by "Weeder" (1878).&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;{{refn|These parodied ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'' by [[Thomas Day]], a moralising work for children; and ''Strathmore'', a novel by [[Ouida]], in his burlesque of which Burnand parodied two genres: novels of high society and Italian peasant stories.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors whom he satirised included [[Victor Hugo]], presented in ''Punch'' as "Fictor Nogo".&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1880s: editor of ''Punch''===
[[File:J L Toole as Paw Claudian.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J. L. Toole]] in Burnand's ''Paw Claudian'', 1884]]
The third editor of ''Punch'', Tom Taylor, died in July 1880; the proprietors of the magazine appointed Burnand to succeed him. In Milne's view the magazine's reputation increased considerably under Burnand:
{{quote|It grew less intolerant of opinions with which it disagreed; it became more catholic in its appeal; it began to discard its air of a Family Joke and aspired to be the National Institution which it has since been proclaimed. Yet he always kept for it a note of irresponsibility.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|}}
A later biographer, Jane Stedman, writes, "His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it."  Burnand, who declared himself "hostile to no man's religion", banned ''Punch'''s previous anti-Catholicism, although he was unable to prevent some antisemitic jokes.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in ''Punch'' and on stage, was satire of the [[aesthetic movement]]. His play ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'' (1881), based on ''The Serious Family'', a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce that he was able to build the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. Burnand rushed ''The Colonel'' into production to make sure that it opened several months before [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s similarly themed comic opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, 2nd Edition, vol. 2, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Patience'' ran even longer than ''The Colonel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Wilde]], no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing ''Patience'': "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of ''The Colonel''".&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, p. 109, letter to [[George Grossmith]], April 1881&lt;/ref&gt; For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of ''[[The Tempest]]'' entitled ''Ariel'' in October 1883, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]], starring [[Nellie Farren]] and [[Arthur Williams (actor)|Arthur Williams]]. ''[[The Times]]'' complained of the "flatness and insipidity" of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original.&lt;ref&gt;"Gaiety Theatre", ''The Times'', 9 October 1883, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;"At the Play", ''The Observer'', 14 October 1883, p. 7; and "Theatres", ''The Times', 8 December 1883, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Burnand wrote ''Paw Claudian'', a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama ''Claudian'' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills, presented at [[Toole's Theatre]] starring [[J. L. Toole]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; The same year, he wrote a burlesque of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', called ''Black Eyed See-Usan'', for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5OE4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 "Dramatic Gossip"], ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]: A Journal'', 16 August 1884, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand wrote several musical works around 1889 and 1890 with the composer [[Edward Solomon]], including ''Pickwick'', which was revived in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1894 production], Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pickwick'' was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with [[George Grossmith]]'s ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David.

===Later years===
[[File:Chieftain poster 1894.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Poster for the original production of ''[[The Chieftain]]'', 1894]]
In 1890, Burnand wrote ''Captain Therèse,'' followed later that year by a very successful English version of Audran's operetta, ''La cigale et la fourmi'' (the grasshopper and the ant) retitled ''La Cigale'', with additional music by [[Ivan Caryll]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lyric Theatre", ''The Times'', 10 October 1890, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, he produced an English adaptation of Audran's ''Miss Helyett'', retitled as ''Miss Decima''. Burnand's ''The Saucy Sally'' premiered in 1892, and ''Mrs Ponderbury's Past'' played in 1895. Burnand's 1897 comic opera, ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', with music by [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], failed despite the contributions of the lyricist [[Adrian Ross]] and a [[Savoy Theatre]] cast including [[Ilka Pálmay]], [[George Grossmith]] and [[Walter Passmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html "''His Majesty''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175437/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html |date=1 September 2006 }}, Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The blame was generally held to be Burnand's. ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case." Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was "marked by distinction as well as humour."&lt;ref&gt;"Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 22 February 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Stedman comments that Burnand's conviction that he, not Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's main collaborator defied the facts: ''The Chieftain'', his rewrite of ''The Contrabandista'' with Sullivan, ran for only 97 performances in 1894, and ''His Majesty'' managed only 61 performances.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Burnand used his position as editor of ''Punch'' to print antagonistic reviews of the plays of Gilbert and refused to give the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas reviews in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, Harry. ''The Two Pins Club'' (1925), excerpted in ''The Gilbert Society Journal'', pp. 315–316, vol. 1, no. 10, Spring 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand's last stage works were a collaboration with J. Hickory Wood, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1905, on a pantomime of ''[[Cinderella]]'', and he was partly responsible for a pantomime of ''Aladdin'' for the same theatre in 1909.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; His later contributions to ''Punch'' became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, but he was a good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers George and [[Weedon Grossmith]], which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by [[Owen Seaman]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1908, Burnand became the editor of ''The Catholic Who's Who'', published by [[Burns &amp; Oates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecatholicuniverse.com/pdf/burnand.pdf ""Burns &amp; Oates"], ''The Universe'', January 8, 1909, accessed July 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand lived for much of his life in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, on the south coast of England and was a member of the [[Garrick Club]] in London.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He had a very large circle of friends and colleagues who included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], Mark Lemon and most writers, dramatists and actors of the day.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; George Grossmith wrote:
{{quote|I think Frank Burnand is the most amusing man to meet. He is brimful of good humour. He will fire off joke after joke, and chaff you out of your life if he gets a chance. His chaff is always good-tempered. No one minds being chaffed by Burnand. I will not sing a song when he is in the room if I can possibly help it. He will sit in front of me at the piano, and either stare with a pained and puzzled look during my comic song, or he will laugh in the wrong places, or, what is worse still, take out his pocket-handkerchief and weep."&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After a winter of bronchitis, Burnand died in 1917 at his home in Ramsgate, at the age of 80. He was buried in the cemetery at St Augustine's Abbey church in Ramsgate.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Books===
Burnand's best-known book, ''Happy Thoughts'', was originally published in ''Punch'' in 1863&amp;ndash;64 and frequently reprinted. This was followed by ''My Time and What I've Done with It'' (1874); ''Personal Reminiscences of the A.D.C., Cambridge,'' (1880); ''The Incomplete Angler'' (1887); ''Very Much Abroad'' (1890); ''Rather at Sea'' (1890); ''Quite at Home'' (1890); ''The Real Adventures of Robinson Crusoe'' (1893); and ''Records and Reminiscences,'' in 1904.

'''''Giacomo Joyce''''' is a posthumously-published work by Irish writer [[James Joyce]]. Written in 1914, following the publication of ''[[Dubliners]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://theoxenofthesun.blogspot.com/2009/05/giacomo-joyce-by-james-joyce-love-me.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was published by [[Faber and Faber]] from sixteen handwritten pages by Joyce. In the free-form love poem, presented in the guise of a series of notes, Joyce attempts to penetrate the mind of a "dark lady", the object of an illicit love affair.

"Giacomo" is the Italian form of the author's forename, [[James (name)|James]].

'''Grassmann's laws''' describe empirical results about how the perception of mixtures of colored lights (i.e., lights that co-stimulate the same area on the retina) composed of different [[spectral power distribution]]s can be algebraically related to one another in a color matching context. Discovered by [[Hermann Grassmann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grassmann|first1=H.|title=Zur Theorie der Farbenmischung|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|date=1853|volume=165|issue=5|pages=69–84|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650505}}&lt;/ref&gt; these "laws" are actually principles used to predict color match responses to a good approximation under [[photopic vision|photopic]] and [[mesopic vision|mesopic]] vision.  A number of studies have examined how and why they provide poor predictions under specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pokorny|first1=Joel|last2=Smith|first2=Vivianne C.|last3=Xu|first3=Jun|title=Quantal and non-quantal color matches: failure of Grassmann’s laws at short wavelengths|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=1 February 2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=A324|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.29.00A324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brill|first1=Michael H.|last2=Robertson|first2=Alan R.|title=Open Problems on the Validity of Grassmann's Laws|journal=Colorimetry|date=2007|pages=245–259|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch10/summary|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470175637.ch10/summary|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassmann's laws can be expressed in general form by stating that for a given color with a [[Spectral density|spectral power distribution]] &lt;math&gt;I(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; the RGB coordinates are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar r(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar g(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar b(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that these are linear in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;; the functions &lt;math&gt;\bar r(\lambda), \bar g(\lambda), \bar b(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[color matching function]]s with respect to the chosen primaries.

[[Indian art]] evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically.

== Rasas in the performing arts ==
{{main|Rasa (aesthetics)}}
[[Image:Durga-mudra.png|right|thumb|Raudram rasa of the destructive fury of goddess [[Durga]] in Bharatanatyam]]
The theory of [[rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]s still forms the [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as [[Bharatanatyam]], [[kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kudiyattam]], [[Kathakali]] and others. Expressing ''Rasa'' in classical Indian dance form is referred to as '''''Rasa-abhinaya'''''. The ''Nātyasāstra'' carefully delineates the ''bhavas'' used to create each ''rasa''.

The expressions used in Kudiyattam or Kathakali are extremely exaggerated theatrical expressions. The opposite of this interpretation is [[Balasaraswathi]]'s school of subtle and understated abhinaya of the devadasis. There were serious public debates when [[Balasaraswathi]] condemned Rukmini Devi's puritanistic interpretations and applications of [[Sringara]] rasa. The abhinaya of the [[Melattur style]] of abhinaya remains extremely rich in variations of the emotions, while the [[Pandanallur style]] expressions are more limited in scope.

==History==
===Natyashastra===
[[Image:Kondadakuli.jpg|thumb|left|"A [[Yakshagana]] artist expressing emotions on stage. Vaachikabhinaya is an important part of Yakshagana"]]
Rasa theory blossoms beginning with the [[Sanskrit]] text [[Nātyashāstra]] (''nātya'' meaning "drama" and ''shāstra'' meaning "science of"), a work attributed to [[Bharata Muni]] where the Gods declare that drama is the 'Fifth Veda' because it is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction. The Nātyashāstra presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhāvas in Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the work as a whole.  Eight rasas and associated bhāvas are named and their enjoyment is likened to savoring a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that arise from the proper preparation of ingredients and the quality of ingredients.

===Kashmiri aestheticians===
The theory of the rasas develops significantly with the Kashmiri aesthetician Ãndandavardhana's classic on poetics, the Dhvanyāloka which introduces the ninth rasa, shānta-rasa as a specifically religious feeling of peace (''śānta'') which arises from its bhāva, weariness of the pleasures of the world.  The primary purpose of this text is to refine the literary concept ''dhvani'' or poetic suggestion, by arguing for the existence of ''rasa-dhvani'', primarily in forms of Sanskrit including a word, sentence or whole work "suggests" a real-world emotional state or bhāva, but thanks to [[aesthetic distance]], the sensitive spectator relishes the rasa, the aesthetic flavor of tragedy, heroism or romance.

The 9th - 10th century master of the religious system known as "the nondual Shaivism of Kashmir" (or "Kashmir Shaivism") and aesthetician, [[Abhinavagupta]] brought rasa theory to its pinnacle in his separate commentaries on the Dhvanyāloka, the Dhvanyāloka-locana (translated by Ingalls, Masson and Patwardhan, 1992) and the Abhinavabharati, his commentary on the [[Nātyashāstra]], portions of which are translated by Gnoli and Masson and Patwardhan.  Abhinavagupta offers for the first time a technical definition of rasa which is the universal bliss of the Self or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] colored by the emotional tone of a drama.

===Inclusion of bhakti===
In the literary compositions, the emotion of Bhakti as a feeling of adoration towards God was long considered only a minor feeling fit only for Stothras, but not capable of being developed into a separate rasa as the sole theme of a whole poem or drama. In the tenth century, it was still struggling, and Aacharya [[Abhinavagupta]] mentions Bhakti in his commentary on the [[Natya Shastra]], as an important accessory sentiment of the Shanta Rasa, which he strove with great effort to establish. However, just as Shantha slowly attained a state of primacy that it was considered the Rasa of Rasas, Bhakti also soon began to loom large and despite the lukewarmness of the great run of Alankarikas, had the service of some distinguished advocates, including [[Tyagaraja]]. It is the [[Bhagavata]] that gave the great impetus to the study of Bhakti from an increasingly aesthetic point of view.

===Attention to rasas===
Poets like [[Kālidāsa]] were attentive to rasa, which blossomed into a fully developed aesthetic system.  Even in contemporary India the term ''rasa'' denoting "flavor" or "essence" is used colloquially to describe the aesthetic experiences in films.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:John tavener 2005.JPG|thumb|Sir John Tavener in 2005]]
'''Sir John Kenneth Tavener''' (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of religious works, including ''[[The Protecting Veil]]'', ''[[Song for Athene]]'' and ''[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]''.

Tavener first came to prominence with his cantata ''[[The Whale (Tavener)|The Whale]]'', premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the musical discovery of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Meirion Bowen|title=Two Tavener Works at the Queen Elizabeth Hall |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener-guardian-review|work=[[The Guardian]]| origyear=13 June 1968 |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Times]]'' said he was "among the very best creative talents of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockian.biz/linn/ckd378.htm Linn Records: "Carmina Celtica: Canty"]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for ''The Protecting Veil'', which as recorded by cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] became a bestselling album, and ''Song for Athene'' which was sung at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral of Princess Diana]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; ''The Lamb'' featured in the soundtrack for [[Paolo Sorrentino]]'s film ''[[The Great Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janusfilms.com/thegreatbeauty/ |title=Janus Films presents The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) |publisher=Janusfilms.com |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener was [[British honours system|knight]]ed in 2000 for his services to music and won an [[Ivor Novello Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article6991720.ece|title=Not just a blip: Ivor Novello awards to recognise computer game music |author=Adam Sherwin|date=18 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Tavener was born on 28 January 1944 in [[Wembley]], London.&lt;ref&gt;David Mason. ''Greene's biographical encyclopedia of composers''. Doubleday, 1995. 31. {{ISBN|0-385-14278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents ran a family building firm&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and his father was also an organist at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in [[Frognal]], [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Ivan Moody. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/27569 "Tavener, John"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 13 November 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 12, Tavener was taken to [[Glyndebourne]] to hear Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', a work he loved for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; That same year he heard Stravinsky’s most recent work, ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'', which he later described as "the piece that woke me up and made me want to be a composer".&lt;ref name=telegraphobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Music Obituary: Sir John Tavener |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10444987/Sir-John-Tavener-obituary.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavener became a music scholar at [[Highgate School]] (where a fellow pupil was [[John Rutter]]).&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys' voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] and Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] and, in 1961 with the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], Shostakovich's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Concerto No. 2]].&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark's [[Coptic Orthodox]] Church),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmark.org.uk/history/pre-1975-st-johns-presbyterian-church |title=Our History (Pre-1975) |publisher=Stmark.org.uk |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he held for 14 years.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;&lt;!-- the St Mark's website says "appointed in 1952" which is obviously wrong, as he was only 8 years old then --&gt;

Tavener entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1962, where his tutors included Sir [[Lennox Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael J Stewart|title=Sir John Tavener obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener|work=The Guardian| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;

==''The Whale'' and early career==
Tavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata ''The Whale'', based on the Old Testament story of [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; It was premièred at the [[London Sinfonietta]]'s début concert,&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; which was also the opening concert of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'', Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on [[Ringo Starr]]'s home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded [[the Beatles]] to have ''The Whale'' recorded by [[Apple Records]] and released in 1970.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; The following year Tavener began teaching at [[Trinity College of Music]], London.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his ''[[A Celtic Requiem]]'', which impressed [[Benjamin Britten]] enough to persuade [[Covent Garden]] to commission an opera from Tavener:&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; the ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright [[Gerard McLarnon]], was ''Thérèse''. When staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; His chamber opera ''A Gentle Spirit'' (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed "far superior to ''Thérèse'', with the internal drama more suited to the stage".&lt;ref name= Guardianobit/&gt; Significantly, it also touched on [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

==Conversion to Orthodox Christianity==
Tavener converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Ivan Moody's NG article does not specify whether the Orthodox Church to which Tavener converted was Russian, Greek, or some other variety.--&gt; Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its [[mysticism]], studying and setting to music the writings of [[Church Fathers]] and completing a setting of the [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]], the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener's first directly Orthodox-inspired music.&lt;ref name=nprobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Anastasia Tsioulcas|title=Remembering 'Holy Minimalist' Composer John Tavener |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/11/12/244788638/remembering-holy-minimalist-composer-john-tavener|work=[[NPR Music]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:William Blake - Songs of Innocence and Experience - The Lamb.jpg|thumb|200px| John Tavener's choral arrangement of [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]" from his collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' is a continually popular work. This image represents copy C, object 8 of that original poem, currently held by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.c.illbk.09&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy C, object 9 (Bentley 8, Erdman 8, Keynes 8) "The Lamb"| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| accessdate = 26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in ''Akhmatova Requiem'': this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its [[The Proms|Proms]]' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[The Lamb]]", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/11167 |title=John Tavener - The Lamb (1982) |publisher=Music Sales Classical |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple [[homophonic]] piece is usually performed as a [[Christmas carol]]. Later prominent works include ''The Akathist of Thanksgiving'' of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; ''The Protecting Veil'', first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at the 1989 Proms; and ''Song for Athene'' (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by [[Mother Thekla]], a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011.&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; ''Song for Athene'' in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener's ''Fall and Resurrection'', first performed in 2000, used instruments such as [[Shofar|ram's horn]], [[Ney|ney flute]] and [[kaval]]. It was dedicated to the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; In 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work ''[[The Veil of the Temple]]'' (which was premièred at the [[Temple Church]], London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as "the supreme achievement of my life",&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours.&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; ''Prayer of the Heart'', written for and performed by [[Björk]], was premiered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=John Tavener, composer and seeker, dies at 69 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/11/12/john-tavener-composer-and-seeker-dies-at-69/3508339/|work=[[USA Today]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Tavener composed ''The Beautiful Names'', a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt;

It had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left [[Orthodox Christianity]] to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]], and became a follower of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] philosopher [[Frithjof Schuon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Morrison|title=99 Names for God: John Tavener Turns his Back on Orthodoxy|publisher=BBC Music|date=November 2004}}: p. 30.  Tavener is quoted as saying, "It strikes me now that all religions are as senile as one another."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David McCleery |title=The Beautiful Names: John Tavener|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/symphonyorchestra/performances/Tavener_biog.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', conducted by British music journalist Michael White, Tavener said: "I reached a point where everything I wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the Orthodox Church, and I felt the need, in my music at least, to become more universalist: to take in other colors, other languages." The interviewer also reported at the time that he "hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/arts/music/17whit.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=music&amp;pagewanted=print&amp; |title=Christian Composer, Inspired by Allah's 99 Names |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the [[BBC Four]] television programme ''Sacred Music'' in 2010, Tavener described himself as "essentially Orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rs3w2 ''Sacred Music''], series 2, episode 4, broadcast in the UK on [[BBC Four]] on 2 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on ''[[Start the Week]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9xr |title=BBC Radio 4 - Start the Week |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2013.

Tavener's funeral was held at the Anglican Cathedral in Winchester on 28 November 2013.  The service was Orthodox, and presided over by Archbishop Gregorios of Thyateira, the representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the most senior Orthodox bishop currently in the UK.  Some 700 mourners attended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25138013 "Sir John Tavener: Hundreds attend composer's funeral"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[John Rutter]] describes Tavener as having the "very rare gift" of being able to "bring an audience to a deep silence."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; According to Steven Isserlis, "he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Style and development===
While Tavener's earliest music was influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular ''Canticum Sacrum'',&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide [[Register (music)|registral space]] and was usually [[diatonic]]ally [[Tonality|tonal]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Tavener recognised [[Arvo Pärt]] as "a kindred spirit" and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.&lt;ref name=White2013p29&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", [[BBC Music Magazine]], Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013): p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''landhuis''' (plural ''landhuizen'') is a Dutch colonial country house, often the administrative heart of a ''particuliere land'' or private domain in the [[Dutch East Indies]], now Indonesia. Many country houses were built by the Dutch in other colonial settlements, such as [[Galle]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Curaçao]], but none as extensively or elaborately as in the Residency of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (an area that includes parts of modern-day [[Jakarta]], [[West Java]] and [[Banten]] provinces). Much of Batavia's reputation as "Queen of the East" rested on the grandeur of these 18th-century mansions.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}}

They were conceived as replicas of the Dutch architecture. Later, designs included features from [[Javanese traditional house|Javanese vernacular architecture]], partly in response to the tropical climate. The result, a fusion of Western and Javanese architecture, became known later as the ''Indies Style'' from the Dutch East Indies. The Indies Style is the first form of a fusion of Dutch and local architecture which gave rise to the subsequent style of early [[Rationalism (architecture)|Dutch Rationalist]] architecture in Indonesia. Despite its heritage and protected status, many of the Indies' country houses were left to deteriorate or were demolished, often due to lack of maintenance.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}} Many of these houses were within the complex owned by the [[Indonesian National Police|National Police]]. Many were transformed into dormitories with improper preservation.

==History==
In 17th century Netherlands, the increasing importance of Holland as a major maritime nation with a growing commercial empire, particularly in the East, had generated capital for the merchant classes of [[Amsterdam]]. These increasingly wealthy merchants began to invest their profits in second residences outside Amsterdam. This second residence, or ''landhuizen'', ranged from modest rural retreats to luxurious manor houses, and were typically seated along the rivers [[Amstel]] and [[Vecht (Utrecht)|Vecht]]. In Batavia, a similar trend occurred in the middle 18th century. When [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] grew increasingly unhealthy during the 18th century, wealthy [[Dutch East India Company]] officials were the first to flee and build grand houses in the surrounding countryside, typically situated between the rivers and roads that led into Batavia.

The officials of the Dutch East India Company built country houses outside the walled city Batavia when the ''Ommelanden'' (the hinterland that lay immediately beyond the walled city) had been pacified and kept free from attacks by Javanese insurgents, who were trying to evict the Dutch occupiers. This was achieved by establishing a circular line of fortified field posts at places like Antjol, Jacatra, Noordwijk, Rijswijk, Angke, and Vijfhoek; most of which were established in the middle 17th century.

The first houses were simple structures, but as time went by, these became opulent country houses in luxurious pleasure gardens, often with their own music pavilion and belfry.

==Indies Style==
The Indies Style appeared very pronounced in the country houses of the Dutch Indies. This style appeared in late 18th-century and gradually adapted to the tropical climate. The style can be divided into three major archetypes: Dutch Style country houses, Transitional Dutch Indies country houses, and Indies style country houses.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} At least one of each of the styles survived as of 2015.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}}

===Dutch Style country houses===
[[File:National Archives of Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|Reiner de Kerk house, now known as the [[National Archives Building, Jakarta|National Archives building]], one of the few Indies country houses of this type that survives to this day.]]
Country houses in the Dutch Style (''Nederlandse stijl'') were popular between 1730-1770.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} They are typically a two-story structure of near replicas of their Dutch counterparts. The Dutch influences are evident in the [[Hip roof|hipped roof]], closed and solid facade and high windows. They often came with belfries, a musical pavilion and a European pleasure garden.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} The only concession to the tropical climate is the relatively large roof overhang compared with the originals. Unlike their Dutch counterparts, Batavian estates included extensive ancillary quarters to accommodate servants, often in the rear of the house.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}} The interior was usually larger than its Dutch counterpart, with a much taller ceiling.

Samples are Weltevreden country house, [[Groeneveld (estate)|Groeneveld House]] in Condet, Reinier de Klerk country house (now the building of the [[National Archives Building, Jakarta|National Archives of Indonesia]]), and [[Jan Schreuder]] country house.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}}

===Transitional Dutch Indies country houses===
[[File:Rumah Besar Cililitan 1930.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rumah Cililitan Besar]], the prototype of the Transitional Dutch Indies country houses, can still be seen today, but in a neglected condition.]]
These ''Nederlands-Indische stijl'',{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} appeared between 1750-1800. Their structure and form  show acculturation to the tropical climate. Still a two-story structure, the facades are protected from the sun and heavy rain by a larger overhanging roof on all sides. The roof profile resembles the local [[joglo]]-style roof traditionally reserved for Javanese noblemen. The upper floor is usually reached by an external staircase and often the central portion was left open for maximum ventilation; as well as tall windows with louvered shutters. The style was also popular in Sumatra.

Samples include [[Rumah Cililitan Besar]] (1775), which is still in existence, although deteriorating.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}} Other examples are ''Pondok Gedeh'' country house and ''Cengkareng'' country house.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}}

===Indies-style country houses===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Landhuis Depan bij Paal Merah Batavia TMnr 60016082.jpg|thumb|right|''Landhuis Depan'' in Batavia.]]
Also known as Indo-European house (''Indo Europeesche Stijl''){{sfn|Schoppert|Damais|1997|pp=72-7}} or ''Indische stijl'',{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} this type appeared between 1790-1820. The form represents the fusion of Dutch and indigenous (Javanese) style. Indies-style country houses were usually built as a single-story structure with front verandahs (''pringgitan'') and rear ''verandahs'' (''gadri''), covered by a [[joglo]]-type pitched roof that extended over the verandahs. Often the verandahs were connected to side galleries for weather protection. The verandah often had potted palms, cool concrete or marble tiles covered with split bamboo mats. The western reference appears in the [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] Tuscan columns supporting the large roof overhang and the decorated doors and windows.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}}

The style was replicated all around the archipelago in the later period. One of the few surviving examples is the dilapidated Cimanggis house, whose roof collapsed before 2013. Other examples are Japan House (built for Andries Hartsinck by the end of 18th century, demolished in 1996), Tjitrap (Citeureup) house, Telukpucung house, Camis house and Tjilodong (Cilodong) house.&lt;ref name="cilodong"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poestahadepok.blogspot.com/2017/07/sejarah-kota-depok-21-sejarah-cilodong.html |title=

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Decline==
With the dissolution of the [[Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie|VOC]], country houses became less popular. During the 19th century, two groups of architectural movements occupied the Dutch East Indies: the universally accepted but fading [[neoclassical style]], appropriate for a colonial empire; and the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]], which gave rise to a neo-vernacular school that combined with [[Art Deco]] to create a tropical style dubbed as [[New Indies Style]].{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono|1998|pp=120}} Whereas the earlier Indies Style were essentially Indonesian houses with European trim, by the early 20th century, the trend was for [[modernist]] influences to be expressed in essentially European buildings with Indonesian trim. Practical measures carried over from the earlier Indies Style, which responded to the Indonesian climate, included overhanging eaves, larger windows and ventilation in the walls.{{sfn|Schoppert|Damais|1997|pp=104-5}}

[[Latvian language|Latvian]]: '''Lauma''', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: '''Laumė''' is a woodland [[Fairy|fae]], and guardian spirit of [[orphans]] in Eastern [[Baltic mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lauma|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/332311/lauma|website=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a sky spirit, her compassion for human suffering brought her to earth to share our fate.

==In Lithuanian mythology==

Laumės are the very oldest goddesses of [[Lithuanian mythology]]. The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical [[Mesolithic]] period, just after the [[Ice Age]]. 
Laumės could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laumės had an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] appearance: they usually had birds’ claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat.  Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to [[centaurs]].  Like [[cyclops]], Laumės often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of [[belemnitida]] found on ground were called "Laumės nipples."

Laumės were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or [[Pinch (action)|tweak]] them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way they were similar to Lamia of [[Greek mythology]]. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laumės kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their [[udder]]s.  Laumės were afraid of tools made from [[iron]].

Laumės can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laumė was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laumė was a bride of thunder god [[Perkūnas]]; however, they did not marry because Laumė fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania.  In other stories the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laumė liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perkūnas was a Laumė called [[Vaiva]]. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perkūnas is angry and shouts in thunder. It was believed it is the rainbow that cause the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laumė fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meilė' - love). Laumė descended to sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laumės breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth.

Laumės descended from sky to Earth. They lived near by lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Lots of names of water pools in Lithuania are named after word Laumė. Laumės liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in night in New Moon or [[Full Moon]]. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like [[Fairy Ring]]) in the grass. Usually, Laumės were most powerful at Friday of [[New Moon]], at the most rainy days of month in Lithuania. Laumės could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laumės song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.

Later on, Laumės were depicted as very beautiful women, who appeared both naked or wearing a very fine clothing. The [[Rainbow]] was often called a ribbon lost by Laumės. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laumės usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women’s work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two example [[Folklore|folk tale]]s featuring Laumės:

===Laumės (fairies) and the baby===
A woman was harvesting a flower bed and had taken her child with her. She was so busy with her work that the child slept the day through, and she left the little one behind.

The woman went home at the end of the day to milk the cows and make dinner. She served her husband, who asked her "Where’s my son?" With terror she whispered, "I have forgotten him!" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laumé speak: "[[Čiūčia liūlia]], forgotten child." The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back. The fairie said, "Come, come, dear woman, take your child, we have done nothing to him. We know that you work very hard, at many jobs, and that you didn’t want to leave your child behind."

The fairies then went on to shower the babe with much treasure, enough gifts to raise several children upon. The mother went home with her precious baby and with her gifts; she was greeted with great joy.

Another woman, hearing of her good fortune, was taken over by jealousy. She took to thinking, "I shall do the same as her, and also be showered in gifts." The next evening, at dusk, she took her child, left him in the fields and went home. She ate dinner, thoughtlessly, before pausing to think of her child—and the treasure.

When she approached the field, she heard the fairies, "[[Čiūčia liūlia]], you left your child in greed." And the child screamed with such great pain, for he was pinched and tortured mercilessly. They continued their torture until the mother came. The fairies tossed the child at her feet. The babe was dead.

===The Fairies foretell a newborn's future===

A Laumė would come to a window and would yell, "Hundreds born, hundreds died, what of his fate?" Another would answer back, "Birth at night, death at night." And again they would yell and moan at the window. From within another would answer, "This nightly birth is a big work smarter not harder, to live well whole life long." Again, yelling at the window, "Hundreds born, hundreds dead, what of his fate?” Another answer: "Morning time born will be a strong worker". And again, after some time, begins the same questioning. The answer was "Noontime born is a very happy child, full of bubbles and envy for what is not strictly in accordance with wealth."

==In Latvian mythology==
In [[Latvian mythology]] Lauma is an assistant at birth, assuring the health and welfare of both mother and child. If the mother does not survive, or gives the child up, she takes on the role of spiritual foster mother for the child. She spins the cloth of life for the child, but weeps at the fate of some. The fact that the cloth can, to a degree, weave itself, indicates a higher power than Lauma.

Over the years, her image has gradually degraded. Accused of baby-snatching by disrespectful husbands (since she is unable to bear children of her own), her looks and sweetness were lost, turning her into an evil old [[hag]]. She weeps at her destined fate, hoping for the day when she will return to her former beautiful self.

Gervereau has been actively engaged in the art world since the 1970s, having participated in exhibitions with several notable [[Surrealism (art)|surrealists]] ([[Philippe Soupault]], [[Belgium|Belgian]] or [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] surrealists, Mirabelle Dors, Alfred Courmes, Maurice Rapin, [[Clovis Trouille]], etc.). His artistic and cultural interests include the [[Dada]] movement, [[Proudhon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Guy Debord]] and [[situationism|the situationist movement]]. He is a member of the [[Collège de 'Pataphysique]].

In 1977, he founded the [[pataphysics|pataphysico]]-situationnist review ''Aux poubelles de la Gloire'' with Guy Bodson.&lt;ref&gt;Bibl. : [ISSN 0399-9440&lt;/ref&gt; There were 13 issues and it finished in 1979. This was the beginning of his philosophy of relativity (''Pour une philosophie de la relativité'', 2010) against relativism. He then built his theories about cultural ecology, evolutionism, necessity of diversity and movement (''plurofuturo''), of choice between past and future (''retrofuturo'') and his struggle against those who have only one way to look at the world, inheritated from the past, and want to uniformise the entire planet (''monoretros'').

He began then his long novel called ''L'homme planétaire'' (end of the 1970s). The middle part of this triptych was published by Sens &amp; Tonka in 2001 with the title ''Ce livre n'est pas à lire'' (''This Book is Not to be Read''). It was chosen by the ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' magazine and the radio channel [[France Culture]] as one of the seven best novels of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Les Inrockuptibles n°301, 21 août 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This book is an experiment in mixed media and local-global description in literature: the "crossmedialism". He will make the adaptation for manga of the third part of the tryptique with a Chinese artist Xin Ye ("Mixplanet", 2011).

In 1989, he built with Louis Rollinde a new artistic group with a new review in English and French: Painters of History (''Les Peintres d'histoire''). Exhibitions were held in Naples, Paris and Hanover. To struggle against the new maelstrom of images, he defended rarity in art and the difficulty to see with hidden images (''La Disparition des images'', 2003). So, he combines art actions or art productions and the creation of unique pieces ("Unik" movement which defends rarity and magic).

After he began to make short movies during the 1970s, he released eight movies. They are experimental documentaries belonging to the "cinema espresso" and were shown from 2009 to 2012 (and after). Official projections were made in January 2011 in the Reflet Médicis in Paris.

He agreed to become president of the See-socioecolo Network, founded in 2010 in Brazil and Canada ([http://see-socioecolo.com/ official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists]). In the end of  2012 he published ''LE LOCAL-GLOBAL. Changer soi pour changer la planète'' (''The Local-Global. Change yourself to change the Planet'') and was nicknamed for years "Mister Local-Global". Last but not least, in 2012, he made an artistic action in Hong Kong with the words: "economy is a belief". In France, he chose: "nostalgia = cancer".&lt;ref&gt;Interview in English on Radio Hong Kong 3, World Vibes 2012/11/10 (podcast http://programme.rthk.hk/channel/radio)&lt;/ref&gt; Other members act in Brazil and Canada, and in some other countries &lt;ref&gt;look at [http://see-socioecolo.com/official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the World Campaign "Knowledge is beautiful".

He creates the local-global annual meeting in Argentat sur Dordogne (France): Les Rencontres-Promenades "Histoires de Passages...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoiresdepassages.com/official website of the Rencontres-Promenades]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabu gave the drawing for the 1st edition (July 2015), which is his last poster, in December 2014.

==The scientific and professional aspects==

He first worked in bookshops and in a bank (Crédit Agricole) to get money to live. He made the choice on October 1, 1978, to work in a museum. It had two consequences: first, to act for the transformation of the patrimonial institutions all over the world (look at the networks part in networks section); second, made the choice to base his researches on all kind of images because he discovered that 98% of the pieces in the collections interested nobody. Then, became the specialist of the World History of Images or ''Histiconologia'' ([http://decryptimages.net.com/general website for cultural education]).

He became the curator of the Museum of Contemporary History (''Musée d'Histoire contemporaine de la Bibliothèque de documentation internationale contemporaine'') in 1991 where he did a lot of exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdic.fr&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he founded the International Association of Museums of History ([http://iamh-aimh.org/official website of the International Association of Museums of History]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and was the president for 14 years. In 1992, he founded the ''Group L'Image'' with [[Fabrice d'Almeida]], Antoine de Baecque, Philippe Buton, Christian Delporte, Laurence Bertrand Dorléac, and David El Kenz.  The review is distributed by [[Gallimard]] in France and [[Harvard University]] in the United States. There are many contributions such as his interview of [[Ernst Gombrich]] in London or [[Arturo Schwarz]] in Milan about [[Marcel Duchamp]]. International colloquiums were held ("Où va l'histoire de l'art contemporain?" / "Where does the History of Contemporary Art go?", "Peut-on apprendre à voir?" / "How to learn to see?", "Quelle est la place des images en histoire?" / "What is the Place of Images in History?" ) and websites were invented with the help of the French government or the European Commission (imagesmag.net, imageduc.net, primages.net) as CD-roms (collection [décrypter les images] |deciphere the images]). Now all these activities belong to the Institute of Images and [http://decryptimages.net/general website of cultural education]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In the Museum of Contemporary History, he works with a lot of different researchers and artists. He built comparative exhibitions (Germany and France during the 1920s, Great Britain and France during the 1960s), exhibitions about foreign countries as Yugoslav space or Russia and USSR and also exhibitions about difficult subjects concerning French history: propaganda under the Vichy Government (1991), War in Algeria (1992), history of immigration, Dreyfus Affair, Deportation, Images and colonies etc. In 2001, he became director of the Museum of Cinema-Henri Langlois in the [[Cinémathèque française]] in Paris.

Every two years, he organized world congresses with different subjects ("How to organize a Multipolar World?", April 2004 in Brazil). He led the EUROCLIO Network about history of Europe and heritage, helped by the [[European Commission]] from 1999 to 2003 with numerous institutions from all countries of the European Union and more. He built the Museums of Europe Network, founding the review of comparatist history "Comparare" with [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlo Ginzburg]], Rudolf von Thadden, [[Bronislaw Geremek]]. He wrote the book ''Vous avez dit musées? Tout savoir sur la crise culturelle'' / ''You said museums? To know everything about the cultural crisis'' ([[CNRS Editions]]).

Concerning the question of images, he published a lot of books during 30 years. The general bibliography (except articles and conferences) is on: [http://gervereau.com/ official website of Laurent Gervereau], look at "traces". Here are some main examples: about the method to analyse images, ''Voir, comprendre, analyser les images'' ([[La Découverte]]); with Cabu, educative comics for children, "Le monde des images. Comprendre les images pour ne pas se faire manipuler" ([[Robert Laffont]]); le ''Dictionnaire mondial des images''/ ''World Dictionary of Images'' (Nouveau monde); the general history of images, ''Images, une histoire mondiale'' (Nouveau monde/CNDP); ''Un siècle de manipulations par l'image'' (Somogy Editions d'art), ''Inventer l'actualité'' (La Découverte), ''La Guerre mondiale médiatique'' (Nouveau monde), the exhibition and the book ''Les images mentent? Manipuler les images ou manipuler le public'': [http://decryptimages.net/ general website for cultural education]. Some translations are done (in Portuguese and in Arabic), but there is still a lack for some important languages as English, Spanish or Chinese.

Gervereau is now the president of the Institut des Images and director of: [http://decryptimages.net/ general website for cultural education]. In July 2013, he created on this website a monthly cultural video magazine: [decryptcult].

In 2004, he became also the director of the International Museum of Ecology: ''Musée du Vivant'' ([http://agroparistech.fr/Musée du Vivant]). He created a world network in UNESCO during the Congress of December 2005 in Te Papa Museum (New Zealand): Ecology and Sustainable Development Network. He wrote in 2011 "Une histoire générale de l'écologie en images" ("A General History of Ecology in Images", about the relations between humanity and environment from prehistory). In 2012, he organized with Christian Delporte the international colloquium "Patrimoine de l'écologie et écologie du patrimoine" / "Heritage of Ecology, Ecology of Heritage".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histecologia.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105154645/http://histecologia.net/ |date=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jacques Le Goff]], who directed Annales review [[Annales School]], wrote in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' (December 15, 2006) about the ''World Dictionary of Images'': "President of the Institute of Images, Laurent Gervereau published a book that will be essential. He built a team to work on the question of all types of images, a team of exceptional specialists, artists or celebrated intellectuals or brilliant young researchers. We know that, after the last years of the 20th century, humanity has entered into the time of images. The sum realised by Gervereau is in the continuity of his book of method ''See, Understand, Analyse Images'' (La Découverte, first edition in 1994) and of the reflections about the new and fundamental object of the human contemporary reality, the visual, visual that he has studied through his book ''History of the Visual in the XXth Century'' (« Points histoire », Le Seuil, 2000). (...) Today, we entered with the Internet into the "Time of accumulation" and this book seems to be the first attempt to decode this new world of mass images in a global World."

=== Movies ===
Eight movies have been directed by Laurent Gervereau (1h45). They are distributed by [http://adav-assoc.com/distribution in France and abroad for Gervereau's movies]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:
* ''A travers les utopies'', road movie between France and Switzerland to see old places of utopias and to think how to change everyday life today
* ''La fabrique des images hybrides'', how all images were censored about the atomic effects in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and how United States and Europe inspired after that the Japonese culture to make through movies, manga, video games a visual mainstream culture
* ''L'info est-elle comestible?'', how we can understand the great crisis of medias through newspapers, TVs, websites, magazines, radios... Many interviews in France, Germany and Switzerland
* ''La pauvreté, c'est quoi?'' Only people from Mali speak about their everyday life, celebrated or not. So, it is a way to ask the questions of what poverty is, of what is the best way to live when we see that money makes moral disasters in United States or Europe. This film is a great lesson of relativity in order to respect every way to look at the world and to behave.
* ''Où sont les déchets?'' An experimental movie (almost nobody speaks) as a dream or a nightmare through India. A reflection about pollution, people rejected from the society (as Adivasis, Aborigens, considered as non human) and destruction, death, rebirth
* ''En attendant l'hiver... Climat et vie quotidienne chez les Inuit'' This film was done with the Inuit (extreme North of [[Nunavik]]). It shows the changes of life, the question of climate and its consequences, but also as Inuit do with collective property (of their houses or the supermarket), how they continue to hunt in this society where money was a complete nonsense, how they negotiate with the new mines and the big companies
* ''Politically InKorect! Noël Arnaud et Dada, Jarry, Picasso, Jorn, Duchamp, Debord, Vian, l'Oulipo...'' Interview, rare documents of this incredible author (Noël Arnaud) who was Dadaist in the 1930s (against Surrealism), was the leader of the Surrealist Group clandestine during the Second World War, promoted the "surréalisme révolutionnaire" before COBRA after the War, pronounced a conference in 1957 with Guy Debord and the situationists, was close to Fluxus or Boris Vian and the Pataphysicians... Debord speaks in the film as Constant (with a special interview). (2013)
* ''Spectateur'' − An experimental film: three days long looking at TV. A reflection about this dying media. The cemetery for a dead Infante. Goyesque movie. (2013)

'''Midrash HaGadol''' or '''The Great Midrash''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''מדרש הגדול''')  was written by Rabbi [[David Adani]] of Yemen (14th century) compilation of [[aggadic midrashim]] on the [[Pentateuch]] taken from the two [[Talmuds]] and earlier [[Midrashim]] of Yemenite provenance.&lt;ref&gt;All of the extant manuscripts used in printing the ''Midrash HaGadol'' were taken out of Yemen, and/or are in the possession of Yemenite Jewish families. In the ''Midrash HaGadol''`s Introduction to the Book of Deuteronomy, it cites the various manuscripts used in reproducing its printed copy, one of which belonging to Yosef and Avraham Sharabi; one of which now in the Hebrew University Library collection; four of which in the ''[[Mossad HaRav Kook]]'' library collection; one of which belonging to the Ben-Zvi Institute library collection; one of which being a private collection belonging to Dr. Meir Benayahu; and the last one belonging to the Bodleian Library collection in Oxford, England (opp. add. 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 124a), all of which being of Yemenite Jewish provenance. There is another manuscript now in the Berlin ''Staatsbibliothek'' Library (Or. 1207), also of Yemenite Jewish provenance, as noted in its colophon. In the Introduction to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Numbers), ''Mossad Harav Kook'' edition, other manuscripts are also mentioned, one of which belonging to Azriel Abyadh-HaLivni; another belonging to the late Yisrael Yeshayahu; another belonging to Rabbi Yechiel Shelomo Kessar; another to Rabbi Shalom Tzabari; another to the Rambam Library in Tel-Aviv; and yet another to the Dr. Israel Mehlmann Library in Jerusalem, ''inter alia''. Other manuscripts were known to be in the possession of the late Rabbi Shalom b. Yosef Halevi Alsheikh and of the Hibshush brothers in Tel-Aviv, as well as private collections in the hand of the late Mordechai Margulies and of Rabbi Y. L. HaCohen Fishman, as noted in the Introduction to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Genesis), ''Mosad HaRav Kook'' edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it borrows quotations from the [[Targums]], and [[Maimonides]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the ''Midrash HaGadol'' on Exodus 30:34 (''Mossad HaRav Kook'' edition), s.v. '''נטף ושחלת וחלבנה''', the glosses makes note of the fact that the quotation used in the ''Midrash HaGadol'' on the Holy Incense has been taken directly from Maimonides' [[Mishneh Torah]] (''Seder Avodah''), ''Hil. Kelei HaMikdash'' 2:4, whose words are these: '''והשחלת היא הציפורן שנותנין בני אדם במוגמרות, וחלבנה כמו דבש שחור היא וריחה קשה והיא שרף אילנות בערי יון'''. There are many other scattered excerpts taken from Maimonides' Code of Jewish Law, and Zvi Meir Rabinowitz makes note of this anomaly in his Preface to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Numbers) in the ''Mossad HaRav Kook'' edition, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kabbalistic]] writings {{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}, and in this aspect is unique among the various midrashic collections. This important work—the largest of the midrashic collections—came to popular attention only relatively recently (late 19th century) through the efforts of [[Jacob Saphir]], [[Solomon Schecter]], and [[David Zvi Hoffman]]. In addition to containing midrashic material that is not found elsewhere, such as the ''Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai'', the Midrash HaGadol contains what are considered to be more correct versions of previously known [[Talmudic]] and [[Midrashic]] passages.

== Discovery ==
The existence of the ''Midrash HaGadol'' was first brought to the attention of Jewish scholarship by [[Jacob Sapir]], who in his ''Even Sapir'' (1866) reports seeing a manuscript of the work in the possession of the Chief Rabbi of [[Jews of Yemen|Yemen]] {{Harv|Fish|1957}}. His remarks about the "discovery" are reproduced in {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}},&lt;ref&gt;''Midrash HaGadol'', on Book of Numbers, Forward written by Fish, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38104&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=5&amp;hilite= pp.5–ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a work on the entire [[Pentateuch]] containing "twice as much as our [[Midrash Rabbah]]". (It is worth noting that while this collection was new to European Jewry, it was probably well known to the [[Jews of Yemen]].) The first manuscript was brought from [[Yemen]] to [[Jerusalem]] and then to [[Berlin]] in 1878 by a certain Mr. Shapira, and this Midrash subsequently became the subject of much scholarly attention. There are currently approximately two hundred manuscripts of this work residing in various public and private Hebraica collections, according to the catalog of the ''Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts''.
[[File:Midrash hagadol manuscript.png|thumb|left|350 px|Manuscript page from '''Midrash HaGadol''' on Genesis.]]
The ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was first published by [[Solomon Schecter]] in 1902. A large portion of ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was then published by [[David Zvi Hoffman]] in 1913. ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Numbers]] was published by S. Fisch in 1940 in a more accessible style than the previous efforts, which were principally arranged for a scholarly audience. More recent editions listed by {{Harvtxt|Strack|Stemberger|1991}} are those on Genesis and Exodus by M. Margulies (1967), on [[Leviticus]] by E.N. Rabinowitz (1932) and [[A. Steinsalz]] (1975), on Numbers by E.N. Rabinowitz (1973), and on [[Deuteronomy]] by S. Fish (1972). The [[Mossad HaRav Kook]] Institute in Jerusalem has also published a five-volume edition.

== Authorship ==
According to {{Harvtxt|Higger|1934}}, the work dates to the late 14th century. A discussion of its authorship is provided in {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}}, wherein he reviews the evidence in favor of the three then-prevailing opinions regarding authorship of the Midrash HaGadol, variously that it is the work of [[Rambam]], his son [[Abraham ben Rambam]], the author according to [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]] (an opinion disputed in later generations),&lt;ref&gt;See ''infra''., note on Avraham Al-Naddaf.&lt;/ref&gt; or David bar Amram al-Adeni.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Al-Naddaf]], in his book, ''Ḥoveret Seridei Teiman'' (חוברת שרידי תימן), published in Jerusalem in 1928, pp. 7a-b (letter "gimel"), and which contains an inventory of books of Yemenite Jewish provenance, attributes the book to David bar Amram al-Adeni. See ''Ḥoveret Seridei Teiman'', [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32338&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=14&amp;hilite= pp. 14–15] in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; After discounting [[Rambam]] as a possible author, and reviewing some compelling factors in favor of the other two possible authors, {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}} offers the conciliatory hypothesis that the work was composed in the [[Arabic language]] by [[Abraham ben Rambam]], and translated into Hebrew by David al-Adeni. While Dr. Fish offers possible explanations for how the work—if indeed authored by Abraham ben Rambam in [[Egypt]]—came first to be "lost" and then to be rediscovered in Yemen, {{Harvtxt|Strack|Stemberger|1991}} find the attribution to Abraham ben Rambam "only extremely weakly attested," and report that modern scholars almost uniformly attribute the work in its entirety to David bar Amram al-Adeni. S. Fish concedes this as well in his [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] article on the topic.

== Sources ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
The ''Midrash HaGadol'' contains material from [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon]], [[Sifre Zutta]], [[Mekilta le-Sefer Devarim|Mekhilta on Deuteronomy]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]], [[Sifre]], and other unknown midrashic sources. In addition, the midrash makes use of the work of [[Rambam]] and [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]], as well as many [[geonic]] writings {{Harv|Strack|Stemberger|1991}}, but the sources are never cited—a unique characteristic of this midrash {{Harv|Fisch|1940}}. All these various sources are fused in such a way that the product is a new literary creation in which the original ingredients can frequently not be unambiguously discriminated.

A "Midrash HaGadol that was brought from [[Aden]]" is cited by [[Joseph Shalit Riqueti]] in ''Sefer Chochmat HaMishkan'' (1676), but it is not known whether this is the same as the work under consideration here.

'''''Moses Leaving for Egypt''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]] and his workshop,  executed around 1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
The commission of the work originated in 1480, when Perugino was decorating a chapel in the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] was pleased by his work, and decided to commission him also the decoration of the new Chapel he had built in the Vatican Palace. Due to the size of the work, Perugino was later joined by a group of painters from Florence, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and others.
[[File:Perugino, Viaggio di Mosè in Egitto 05.jpg|left|thumb|230px|Detail.]]
Perugino's assistants in the Sistine Chapel included [[Pinturicchio]]. Some  figures in the fresco were traditionally attributed to him, but this has been disputed by 20th-century art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Filippo|last=Todini|title=La Pittura Umbra|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were  painted by [[Andrea d'Assisi]], Rocco Zoppo or, less likely, [[Lo Spagna]] or [[Bartolomeo della Gatta]], other Perugino's collaborators of the time.

==Description==
The fresco depicting the voyage of [[Moses]] is the first on the wall right to the altar, and faces the ''[[Baptism of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|Baptism of Christ]]'' on the opposite wall. 

The painting shows Moses (dressing in yellow and green as in the other frescoes of the cycle) leaving for Egypt, after he had been exiled from [[Midian]], with [[Zipporah]] to his right. In the center, an angel asks him to circumcise his son [[Eliezer]] (scene on the right), as a sign of the alliance between [[Yahweh]] and the [[Israelites]]. The baptism, depicted on the opposite fresco, was in fact considered by several early Christian writers, including [[Augustine]], as a kind of "spiritual circumcision". The ceremony is on the right, and includes Zipporah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harwood|first1=Edith|title=Notable pictures in Rome|date=1907|publisher=J.M. Dent|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the right background [[Moses]] and Zipporah are greeting [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] before leaving. Natural elements include the hill landscape in the background, characterized by thin trees (including a palm, a symbol of Christian sacrifice), and the birds: two of them are mating, an allusion to the renovations cycles of the nature. On the left background is a group of shepherds. The dames with flying dresses were a common element of Florentine early Renaissance painting, used also by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and [[Botticelli]].

'''Piero della Francesca''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpjɛːro della franˈtʃeska}} {{Audio|It-Piero della Francesca.oga|&lt;small&gt;listen&lt;/small&gt;}}; c. 1415&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; – 12 October 1492) was an [[list of Italian painters|Italian painter]] of the [[Italian Renaissance|Early Renaissance]]. As testified by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', to contemporaries he was also known as a mathematician and [[List of geometers|geometer]]. Nowadays Piero della Francesca is chiefly appreciated for his art. His painting is characterized by its serene [[humanism]], its use of geometric forms and  [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. His most famous work is the cycle of frescoes ''[[The History of the True Cross]]'' in the church of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of [[Arezzo]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Piero was born and died in the town of [[Sansepolcro|Borgo Santo Sepolcro]],&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; modern-day [[Tuscany]], to Benedetto de' Franceschi, a tradesman, and Romana di Perino da [[Monterchi]], members of the Florentine and Tuscan Franceschi noble family.

[[File:Piero della Francesca - Baptism of Christ - WGA17595.jpg|thumb|left|''The [[Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Baptism of Christ]]'', (c. 1450) ([[National Gallery]], London).]]&lt;!--KEEP THIS HERE TO AVOID BLANK LINES--&gt;

He was most probably apprenticed to the local painter Antonio di Giovanni d'Anghiari, because in documents about payments it is noted that he was working with Antonio in 1432 and May 1438.&lt;ref&gt;Banker, James R., ''The culture of Sansepolcro during the youth of Piero della Francesca'', The University of Michican Press, 2003, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banker, James R., "Piero della Francesca as Assistant to Antonio d'Anghiari in the 1430s: Some Unpublished Documents",''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 135, No. 1078 (January 1993). pp. 16–21. {{jstor|/885421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He certainly took notice of the work of some of the [[Siena|Sienese]] artists active in San Sepolcro during his youth; e.g. [[Sassetta]]. In 1439 Piero received, together with [[Domenico Veneziano]], payments for his work on [[fresco]]es for the church of Sant'Egidio in Florence, now lost. In Florence he must have met leading masters like [[Fra Angelico]], [[Luca della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. The classicism of [[Masaccio]]'s frescoes and his majestic figures in the [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]] were for him an important source of inspiration. Dating of Piero's undocumented work is difficult because his style does not seem to have developed over the years.

===Mature work===
In 1442, Piero was listed as eligible for the City Council of Sansepolcro. Three years later, he received a commission to paint the [[altarpiece of the church of the Misericordia|''Madonna della Misericordia'' altarpiece]] for the church of the Misericordia in Sansepolcro, which was completed in the early 1460s. In 1449 he executed several frescoes in the [[Castello Estense]] and the church of Sant'Andrea of [[Ferrara]], now also lost. His influence was particularly strong in the later Ferrarese [[allegory|allegorical]] works of [[Cosimo Tura]].

Two years later he was in [[Rimini]], working for the [[condottieri|condottiero]] [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]. In 1451, during that sojourn, he executed the famous fresco of ''St. Sigismund and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta'' in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]], as well as a [[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|portrait of Sigismondo]]. In Rimini, Piero may have met the famous [[Renaissance]] mathematician and architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who had redesigned the [[Tempio Malatestiano]], although it is known that Alberti directed the execution of his designs for the church by correspondence with his building supervisor. Thereafter Piero was active in [[Ancona]], [[Pesaro]] and [[Bologna]].
[[File:Piero della Francesca Malatesta.jpg|thumb|''[[St. Sigismund and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' (1451)]]
In 1454, he signed a contract for the ''Polyptych of Saint Augustine'' in the church of Sant'Agostino in Sansepolcro. The central panel of this [[polyptych]] is lost, and the four panels of the wings, with representations of [[saint]]s, are now scattered around the world. A few years later, summoned by [[Pope Nicholas V]], he moved to Rome, where he executed frescoes in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], of which only fragments remain. Two years later he was again in the Papal capital, painting frescoes in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican Palace]], which have since been destroyed.

The ''Baptism of Christ'', now in the [[National Gallery]] in London, was executed in about 1460 for the high altar of the church of the Priory of S. Giovanni Battista at Sansepolcro. Other notable mature works of Piero della Francesca are the frescoes of the ''[[Resurrection (Piero della Francesca)|Resurrection of Christ]]'' in Sansepolcro, and the ''[[Madonna del parto]]'' in [[Monterchi]], near Sansepolcro.

===Frescoes in San Francesco at Arezzo===
[[File:Piero della Francesca- Legend of the True Cross - the Queen of Sheba Meeting with Solomon; detail.JPG|left|thumb|220px|''[[Legend of the True Cross]]'' – the [[Queen of Sheba]] meeting with [[King Solomon]].]]
In 1452, Piero della Francesca was called to [[Arezzo]] to replace [[Bicci di Lorenzo]] in painting the frescoes of the basilica of [[San Francesco, Arezzo|San Francesco]]. The work was finished before 1466, probably between 1452 and 1456.
The [[The History of the True Cross|cycle of frescoes]], depicting the [[Legend of the True Cross]], is generally considered among his masterworks and those of [[Renaissance painting]] in general. The story in these frescoes derives from legendary medieval sources as to how timber relics of the [[True Cross]] came to be found. These stories were collected in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacopo da Varazze]] ([[Jacopo da Varagine]]) of the mid-13th century.
&lt;ref name="goldenlegend"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume3.htm#invention%20of%20the%20Holy%20Cross "The Golden Legend, or Lives of the Saints" Volume Three], retrieved on 2007-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piero's activity in Urbino===
Between 1469 and 1486 Piero della Francesca worked repeatedly in the service of Count [[Federico III da Montefeltro]] (Duke in 1474). According to Giorgio Vasari, Piero would have worked for Federico's father Guidantonio, who died in February 1443. However, this is unlikely because this statement is not confirmed by documents or paintings. Vasari may have confused Guidantonio with Federico. ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation]]'' is generally considered Piero's oldest work in Urbino (dating c. 1455–1470). It is one of the most famous and controversial pictures of the early Renaissance. As discussed in its own entry, it is marked by an air of geometric sobriety, in addition to presenting a perplexing enigma as to the nature of the three men standing at the foreground.
[[File:Piero - The Flagellation.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''[[Flagellation of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]''. [[Galleria Nazionale delle Marche]], [[Urbino]] ]]
Another famous work painted in Urbino is the ''Double Portrait'' of Federico and his wife Battista Sforza, in the [[Uffizi]]. The portraits in profile take their inspiration from large bronze medals and stucco roundels with the official portraits of Fedederico and his wife. Other paintings made in Urbino are the monumental ''[[Brera Madonna|Montefeltro Altarpiece]]'' in the Brera Gallery in Milan and probably also the ''[[Madonna of Senigallia]]''.

In Urbino Piero met the painters [[Melozzo da Forlì]], [[Fra Carnevale]] and the Flemish [[Justus van Gent]] (or Joos van Wassenhove or Giusto di Gant), the mathematician Fra [[Luca Pacioli]], the architect [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]] and probably also [[Leon Battista Alberti]].

===His later years===
In his later years, painters such as [[Perugino]] and [[Luca Signorelli]] frequently visited his workshop. It is documented that Piero rented a house in Rimini in 1482. Although he may have given up painting in his later years, Vasari's remarks that he went blind at old age and at the age of sixty, have to be doubted, since in 1485 he completed his treatise on regular solids, dedicated to Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, son and heir of Duke Federico, in his own fine handwriting. Piero made his will in 1487 and he died five years later, on 12 October 1492, in his own house in San Sepolcro. He left his possessions to his family and the church.  He died the same [[Columbus Day|day]] that [[Christopher Columbus]] [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|arrived in the Americas]].

==Criticism and interpretation==
Recently, the [[Frick Collection]] in New York until 19 May 2013, collected seven of the eight extant paintings of Piero known to exist in the United States for exhibition. Of the seven pieces in the exhibit, critic [[Jerry Saltz]] writing in ''New York'' magazine singled out Piero's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels'' for its exemplary qualities. Saltz states that, "The Virgin and child are elevated two steps. They are in a world itself apart from this world apart. Mary isn't looking at her child and looks instead at the rose he reaches for. You begin to glean the revelation she is having. The flower represents love, devotion, and beauty. It also symbolizes blood and the crown of thorns Christ will wear. This child who will suffer a horrendous death reaches for his acceptance of fate. Mary does not pull the flower back. You sense an inner agony, noticing her deep-blue robe open to reveal scarlet beneath, symbol of outward passion and pain to come. In the dead-center vertical line of the painting is Christ's right palm that will be nailed to the cross." Saltz accepted this oil painting as the most exceptional work of Piero on display in the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry (2013). "Take the Day Off. Go to the Frick." ''New York'' magazine, 11 March 2013, pp121-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in mathematics and geometry==
[[File:Resurrection.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The [[Resurrection (Piero della Francesca)|''Resurrection'']] (c. 1463-5)]]
Piero's deep interest in the theoretical study of perspective and his contemplative approach to his paintings are apparent in all his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=J. V.|title=Piero della Francesca. A Mathematician’s Art|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10342-5|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200703/rev-emmer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his youth, Piero was trained in mathematics, which most likely was for mercantilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T067465?q=piero+della+francesca&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=Piero della Francesca|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Art Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three treatises written by Piero are known to modern mathematicians: ''Abacus Treatise (Trattato d'Abaco)'', ''Short Book on the Five Regular Solids (Libellus de Quinque Corporibus Regularibus)'' and ''On Perspective for Painting'' (''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]]''). The subjects covered in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Biographers of his patron, [[Federico da Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]], record that he was encouraged to pursue the interest in perspective which was shared by the Duke.

In the late 1450s, Piero copied and illustrated the following works of [[Archimedes]]:&lt;ref name = "jim"&gt;James Banker, ''A Manuscript of the Works of Archimedes in the Hand of Piero della Francesca'', «Burlington Magazine», CXLVII, March 2005, pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Sphere and the Cylinder; On the Measurement of the Circle; On Conoids and Spheroids; On Spirals; On the Equilibrium of Planes; On the Quadrature of the Parabola; The Sand Reckoner''. The [[manuscript]] consists of 82 folio leaves. It's held in the collection of the [[Biblioteca Riccardiana]]&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/10646/ |title = On the Sphere and the Cylinder; On the Measurement of the Circle; On Conoids and Spheroids; On Spirals; On the Equilibrium of Planes; On the Quadrature of the Parabola; The Sand Reckoner |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1450–1460 |accessdate = 2013-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a copy of the translation of the Archimedean corpus made by the Italian humanist [[Iacopo da San Cassiano]] (also known as [[Iacobus Cremonensis]]).&lt;ref name = "pdan"&gt;Paolo d'Alessandro e Pier Daniele Napolitani, ''Archimede latino.Iacopo da San Cassiano e il corpus archimedeo alla metà del Quattrocento'', Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspirations==
[[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote a three movement work for orchestra entitled ''[[Les Fresques de Piero della Francesca]]''. Dedicated to [[Rafael Kubelik]], it was premiered by Kubelik and the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] at the 1956 Salzburg Festival. Piero's geometrical perfection and the almost magic atmosphere of the light in his painting inspired modern painters like [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Massimo Campigli]], [[Felice Casorati]] and [[Balthus]].

'''Pressed flower craft''' consists of drying [[flower]] petals and leaves in a '''flower press''' to flatten and exclude [[light]] and moisture. Pressing flowers makes them appear flat, and there is often a change in [[color]], ranging from faded colors to a greater intensity of vibrant colors. It has long been practiced as an art form in China and in Japan, where it is known as Oshibana ([[:ja:押し花|押し花]]).&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townsend|first1=S. P.|title=Oshibana|journal=Bulletin - Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden|date=1987|volume=17|issue=1|pages=12–13|url=http://agricola.nal.usda.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=oshibana&amp;DB=local&amp;CNT=25&amp;Search_Code=GKEY&amp;STARTDB=AGRIDB|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Asia, the art gained popularity in [[England]] during the [[Victorian era]] and has experienced a revival in the last 30 years or so. It is currently used in Australia and in the [[United States]] by some recognized artists, including [[Cellestine Hannemann]] and Janie Gross,.&lt;ref name=Phillymag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillymag|title=Home: Pressing On|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/home-pressing-on/|accessdate=20 March 2015|agency=Philadelphia|publisher=Metrocorp|date=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressed [[flowers]] and leaves can be used in a variety of [[craft]] projects. They are often mounted on special [[paper]], such as [[handmade paper]], [[Ingres paper]], [[Japanese paper]], or paper decorated by [[paper marbling|marbling]]. With meticulous attention to detail, each leaf and flower is glued onto a precise location. With a creative approach to the use of materials, a leaf becomes a tree and petals form mountains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Washes of [[watercolor painting]] are sometimes applied to the backing paper before the pressed material is attached. Pressed material may also be mounted on fabrics, such as [[velvet]], [[silk]], [[linen]] or [[cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16712180|title=The book of pressed flowers|last=Penny.|first=Black,|date=1988|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0671660713|location=New York|oclc=16712180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petals and leaves can be applied to wood furnishings using the technique of [[Decoupage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44763945|title=Découpage the easy way|date=2001|publisher=Sterling Pub|others=Plaid Enterprises.|isbn=0806936371|location=New York|oclc=44763945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pressed Flower Craft Guild==
The Pressed Flower Craft Guild was established in 1983 by Joyce Fenton (a pressed flower artist) and Bill Edwardes (who devised the method of framing pressed flower pictures adopted by the Guild). It has members throughout the UK and in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressedflowerguild.org.uk/|title=The Pressed Flower Guild - Home|website=www.pressedflowerguild.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its stated aims are:
* To raise the general standard of pressing flowers by enabling members to meet and share expertise and experiences;
* To arrange teaching and seminar facilities for members and to encourage the formation of local groups;
* To enable members to be part of a Guild which has a reputation for ensuring the highest standard in preservation of natural materials, presentation and "finish" of the product; and
* To encourage members to improve their standard of work by a series of assessments to attain Bronze, Silver or Gold awards. In the case of overseas members, to obtain Grade I and Grade II Awards.

Proficiency awards in a number of different specialities may be attained after the Gold Award is gained. The Overseas Advanced Award may be taken by overseas members who have gained the Grade I and Grade II awards. A different subject for both of these awards is announced annually.

==International organizations==

===International Pressed Flower Art Society===
The IPFAS in an international pressed flower organization that promotes pressed flower art and offers education and holds competitions. It has members from over 20 nations (as of 2010) including Japan, the United Kingdom, United States, France, Germany, Mexico, and Australia. It was founded in 1999 by Nobuo Sugino, a Japanese pressed flower artist and President of Japan Wonderful Oshibana Club.&lt;ref name="Phillymag"/&gt;

===Worldwide Pressed Flower Guild (WWPFG)===
The WWPFG was established in July 2001. In November 2008, the guild was incorporated in North Carolina, USA, as a public educational non-profit organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwpfg.com/|title=World Wide Pressed Flower Guild|website=www.wwpfg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence''' (RBA) was established in 1986 by [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] architect Simeon Bruner. The award is named after Simeon Bruner’s late father, Rudy Bruner, founder of the Bruner Foundation.&lt;ref name=brunerfoundation /&gt;  According to the Bruner Foundation, the RBA was created to increase understanding of the role of architecture in the urban environment and promote discussion of what constitutes urban excellence. The award seeks to identify and honor places, rather than people, that address economic and social concerns along with urban design.&lt;ref name=Placemaking&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneekloth|first=Lynda H.|title=Placemaking: The Art and Practice of Communities|year=1995|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0471110264|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
According to the Bruner Foundation, the award is intended to be a platform for the discussion of issues related to urban architecture, planning and revitalization. It has been recognized by the [[United States Conference of Mayors]], The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], and the [[Environmental Design Research Association]].&lt;ref name=EDRA&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Design and Research Association|url=http://www.edra.org/|publisher=Environmental Design and Research Association|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The biennial award recognizes one Gold Medal and four silver medal winners each cycle. Each medalist is documented with a detailed case study published online and in a book by the Bruner Foundation. The gold medal winner receives $50,000 and the four silver medalists each receive $10,000 which must be used to benefit the project.&lt;ref name=brunerfoundation /&gt; These winners are chosen by a diverse committee of professionals involved in design and development. These committee members include architects, landscape architects, planners, developers, community organizers, financiers, and the mayor of a major metropolitan area.&lt;ref name="Time-Saver Standards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Donald|title=Time-Saver Standards for Urban Design|year=2003|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=007068507X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria and selection process ==
The selection process involves a study of a project’s effect on its urban environment including a detailed application, discussion by selection committee members, and  site visits to finalist projects. A selection committee is organized anew for each award cycle.&lt;ref name=Metropolis&gt;{{cite web|last=Lubenau|first=Anne-Marie|title=Rudy Bruner Award 2013 Medalists Reveal New Thinking About Urban Excellence|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/Point-of-View/June-2013/Rudy-Bruner-Award-2013-Medalists-Reveal-New-Thinking-About-Urban-Excellence/|work=Metropolis Magazine|publisher=Metropolis Magazine|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be eligible for consideration, projects must be:
* an actual place, not just a plan or a program;
* completed and in operation for sufficient amount of time to demonstrate success
* located in the continental US

There are no distinct categories. Projects may include any type that makes a positive contribution to the urban environment. Urban environment is broadly defined to include cities, towns, neighborhoods, counties and/or regions. Previous applicants and honorable mention winners may apply up to three times. Previous winners are not eligible.&lt;ref name=Metropolis /&gt;

== Resources ==
In 1998 the [[University of Buffalo]] collaborated with the Bruner Foundation and the Urban Design Project of the School of Architecture and Planning to create a [https://ubir.buffalo.edu/xmlui/handle/10477/24428 digital archive], making data gathered in reference to past winners of the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="University of Buffalo"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Archive|url=http://libweb.lib.buffalo.edu/bruner/about/|work=Rudy Bruner Award Digital Archive|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this archive is to allow public "access to award winning
and fully documented urban design case studies as a resource for architecture students and practitioners as they study precedents in urban design." The Digital Archive is managed by the UB Institutional Repository.&lt;ref name="University of Buffalo" /&gt;

The Bruner Foundation has published fifteen books containing detailed case studies of award-winning projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba www.brunerfoundation.org/rba&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15427">[[Sacred music]] and dance are fundamental to the [[Santo Daime]] religion. The earliest [[hymns]] are those of the founder, [[Mestre Irineu|Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu']]. While the rituals and music originated with a very few hymns, sung by a small group in the Brazilian Amazon, the practice of these spiritual works in diverse parts of the world since it began expansion around the beginning of the 1990s has given rise to a significant body of music, in many languages. Daimistas from [[Brazil]] and other countries have contributed to this growing genre, while continuing to sing the principle hinarios in Portuguese. 

Among adherents to the doctrine, songs tend to be referred to as 'received'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santodaime.org/archives/murilo3.htm/ |title=SantoDaime.org archives, José Murilo C. Carvalho Jr. |accessdate=2009-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104204120/http://www.santodaime.org/archives/murilo3.htm |archivedate=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from a spiritual source rather than written from the writers mind alone and confirmed by their use in ritual. Variously these hymns may be viewed as 'calling' energies or divine entities, as transmitting sacred doctrine, as bringing healing through the act of singing what the community is affirming are eternal truths. In the spiritual works and communities of Santo Daime, the hymns are a bond of shared understanding and a daily practice. New hymns are often introduced in ceremony by those who receive them, by the leader's invitation.

A Santo Daime '''hinário''' (Portuguese) or ''hymn-book (hinario)'', can be a life work of its owner, chronicling that person's spiritual journey. During a ritual, one or several hinários or compilations may be sung in their entirety. While they are sung outside of the rituals in ensaio (practice) and listened to in various settings, the real distinction of is genre is that it is intended to be sung in ritual, by a group going into what is understood to be spiritual work of transformation. The hymns can be seen as integral to the ritual, the transformation, and the revealed messages as each person understands them. Hinarios that are central to the doctrine may be sung once or several times per year, and practiced many times more.

== Calendar of official hinarios ==

Mestre Irineu on the Virgin of Conception (Dec. 7), Christmas, Day of Kings (January 6), St. John (June 23). The hinario of Padrinho Sebastiao is sung on Irineu's birthday (Dec. 15), Saint Sebastian (January 19), Madrinha Rita's birthday (June 25), as well as Brazilian Father's Day. Padrinho Alfredo's hinario is sung on Padrinho Alfredo's birthday (January 7), St. Joseph (March 18), and Saint Peter (June 28), as well as New Year's Eve (December 31)

==Historical Hinarios==

===[[Mestre Irineu|Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu']]===

'O Cruzeiro' (The Cross), 'Cruzeirinho' (The Little Cross) and 'A Santa Missa' (The Holy Mass)

The first part of Mestre Irineu's hinário, '''''O Cruzeiro''''', contains hymns up to number 116. After an interval of 11 years he received hymns 117 through 128, which are now known as the '''''Cruzeirinho''''' or occasionally as the ''Hinos Novos''. After the time of Mestre Irineu it became a more common practice to finish or close an hinario as a complete work, after which a new hinario might be received.

===Sebastião Mota de Melo - 'Padrinho Sebastião'===

'O Justiceiro' and 'Nova Jerusalem' (The New Jerusalem)

Nova Jerusalem is the second and final hinario of Padrinho Sebastião, consisting of 26 hymns. 

===Rita Gregório de Melo- 'Madrinha Rita'===

'Lua Branca' (White Moon)

Rita Gregório de Melo is the widow of Padrinho Sebastião, matriarch of the CEFLURIS line, mother of 11 children, and lives in Céu do Mapiá. She is thought to have been born 25 June 1925 in Rio Grande do Norte.
 
===Júlia Gregório da Silva - 'Madrinha Júlia'===

'O Convite'  (The Invitation)

Júlia Gregório da Silva was born in Açu, Rio Grande do Norte, in 1933. She was the younger sister of Madrinha Rita, and the mother of six children.

===Cristina Raulino da Silva - 'Madrinha Cristina'===

'A Mensagem' (The Message)

Cristina Raulino da Silva was born in Rio Branco, Acre, in 1938. She married Manuel Gregório (Padrinho Nel), the brother of Madrinha Rita.
 
===Alfredo Gregório de Melo - 'Padrinho Alfredo'===

'O Cruzerinho', 'Nova Era' (The New Age) and 'Nova Dimensão' 

Nova Dimensão is the third (yet to be completed) hinario of Padrinho Alfredo.

Alfredo Gregório de Melo, one of the sons of Padrinho Sebastião and Madrinha Rita, today heads the CEFLURIS line which Padrinho Sebastião founded, based in Céu do Mapiá, Amazonas. He was born 7 January 1950 in the seringal (rubber extraction area) Adélia along the Juruá river in the state of Amazonas.

===João Pedro===

João Pedro was a contemporary of Mestre Irineu. All we know is that his strong, healing hinário only became known to Santo Daime after his death.

===Maria Marques Vieira - 'Maria Damião'===

'O Mensageiro' (The Messenger)

Maria Marques Vieira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/os_companheiros/maria_damiao_familiajuramidam.html|title=Bio of Maria Damiao (in portuguese) by Rodrigo Borges Conti Tavares|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in Belém do Pará, in 1917. She was very young when she moved with her family to Rio Branco, Acre, where she met Mestre Irineu, in the early 1930s. She was sallow and blond with white skin. Maria Damião, as she was known, married and had seven children (one adopted) but lost her husband early. She worked hard to support her family but had many difficulties in her material life, as in her works with Santo Daime. She died of pneumonia, aged just 32 years, on 2 April 1949.
 
===Antônio Gomes===

'O Amor Divino' (The Divine Love)

Antônio Gomes da Silva was born in Ceará, 30 April 1885. He married Maria de Nazaré in Ceará, and had five children. He lived in Belém do Pará for a while, and then moved to Rio Branco, Acre, in 1921. He worked as a seringueiro, or rubber tapper, and later as a farmer. He lost his first wife, married again, and had another four children. He met Mestre Irineu in 1938, and he received benefits for his unstable health. Antônio Gomes then became a member of the Santo Daime doctrine, as did his whole family. His son Leôncio became the new leader of Alto Santo, after Mestre Irineu's death, in 1971. His granddaughter, Peregrina Gomes, was the third wife of Mestre Irineu. Antônio Gomes da Silva died 14 August 1946.

===Germano Guilherme===

'Vós Sois Baliza' (Thou art a Beacon)

Germano Guilherme dos Santos was born in Piauí at the beginning of the 20th century. He moved with his family to Rio Branco, Acre, where he lived on the outskirts of the city working as a farmer. Germano was one of the first disciples of Mestre Irineu, becoming a member of Santo Daime in the 1930s. He was a black man with notably white teeth. Germano had special feelings for Mestre Irineu, and called him maninho, or 'my little brother'. He suffered a disease on his leg that bothered him a lot. Because of this, he couldn't eat some kinds of food. But when he was at maninho's house, Germano ate everything he wanted and didn't feel anything. He was married to Cecília Gomes, the daughter of Antônio Gomes and Maria de Nazaré, but had no children. His hinário is sung at CICLU - Alto Santo along with the O Cruzeiro hinário of Mestre Irineu. Germano Guilherme dos Santos died in 1964.
 
===João Pereira===

'Seis de Janeiro' (January 6; which is King's day, or [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]])

João Pereira was born in Porongaba, Ceará, in the end of the 19th century. Nobody knows the date he moved to Rio Branco, Acre. In the early 1930s, he joined Mestre Irineu, and became one of his first disciples. João Pereira was almost bald, and his complexion was swarthy or similar to that of caboclos, the mixed blood people of the Amazonian region. He worked as a farmer and wagon driver. He lived near Rio Branco and was married with Maria Franco (Maria Marques Feitosa), the mother of the second wife of Mestre Irineu, Raimunda. João Pereira died in 1954.
 
===Tetéu/Teteo (Francisco Fernandes Filho)===

After Mestre Irineu passed on, his last wife's uncle Leôncio Gomes assumed command of the works, and in turn after Leôncio Gomes' passing, Francisco Fernandes Filho (Tetéu or Teteo) took over; however, he apparently very soon quarreled with Mestre Irineu's widow, Dona Peregrina Gomes Serra, and was chased out of Mestre Irineu's house (Alto Santo), according to Edward MacRae. Tetéu then founded a new center less than a kilometer away, declaring himself to be the real CICLU.  Following Sr. Luis Mendes' presidency, Tetéu's eventual successor, Mr. João Rodrigues Facundes (who was also involved in the initial dispute), returned the legal name and charter of CICLU to Dona Peregrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/english/the_children_of_juramidam/genealogy.htm|title=Genealogy of the Santo Daime Doctrine|website=www.afamiliajuramidam.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Known for sleeping light and little, Tetéu received his nickname after a bird (''[[Southern lapwing|Vanellus chilensis]]'') commonly called "Tetéu" who was also believed to not sleep much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afamiliajuramidam.org/os_companheiros/teteo.htm|title=Os Companheiros - Tetéo|website=afamiliajuramidam.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hinario ''[http://nossairmandade.com/hinario.php?hid=32 O Assesor]'' has 132 hymns, including a number of Daime serving hymns (Eu Tomo Daime, O Daime Me Balançou, Mesa De Centro, Daime é O Nosso Pai, Um, Dois E Três) and is sung in some churches, where it is known, to honor the passing of Mestre Irineu on July 6. Where it is not known well, Mestre Irineu's hinario ''O Cruzeiro,'' is sung (a Capella in the churches of Sr. Luis Mendes). 
 
===Maria Brilhante===

Maria Brilhante was married with Padrinho Eduardo Salles Freitas, and they had four children, three of whom survive. Madrinha Maria Brilhante received a hinário which is officially sung on the festival of St. Anthony every 12-13 June.

==Some Contemporary Hinários==

===Baixinha===

'Guia Mestre' (Master Guide), 'Mensageiros da Cura' (Messengers of Healing),
'Hinário da Fé' (Hinario of the Faith), 'Estrela D'Água' (Star of the Water. Baixinha's new hinario)

Baixinha, ''tiny'' in Portuguese, is perhaps the best known practitioner of UmbanDaime. She is a small woman of scarcely one and a half meters, who has spent more than forty years in [[Umbanda]], twenty-one in [[Candomblé]], and eighteen years in Santo Daime. Despite her small stature, she was known by many as a true spiritual beacon and traveled extensively, even after she'd become very old. She led a spiritual community in Lumiar, a mountain village two hours from Rio de Janeiro until her passage in 2015 working in two worlds (spiritual and physical) and two doctrines (Daimista and Umbandista).

===Glauco Villas Boas===

'O Chaveirinho' &amp; 'O Chaveirão'

Hinário received by prominent cartoonist [[Glauco Villas Boas]] (March 10, 1957 - March 12, 2010), commander of the Céu de Maria church in São Paulo, and consisting of 41 hymns in O Chaveirinho and 11 in O Chaveirão. 

Glauco came from a [[Villas-B%C3%B4as brothers|family of legends]], and became a legend in his own right. As one of the most recognizable and timely artists of Brazil in the late 20th century, he formed a bond with fellow cartoonists [[Laerte]] and [[Angeli (cartoonist)|Angeli]] that produced a significant, massive body of work over decades.  As daily political cartoonist for [[Folha de S.Paulo|Folha de São Paulo]] (Sao Paulo's principal daily newspaper), he was looked to by Paulistas to interpret and shed light on the news of the day in his own courageous, take-no-prisoners style. 

While participating in early works at Flor das Aguas in Itapecerica da Serra (SP), Glauco inaugurated Ceu de Maria in his own home, then built a church on a peak high above Sao Paulo called [[Pico do Jaragu%C3%A1|Pico do Jaraguá]]. An accomplished musician, he was well known for his fiery accordion playing and said that he had never once practiced outside of ceremony, relying instead on the force of the Daime to pull the music.

===Alex Polari===

'Nova Anunciação'

Alex Polari spent years as a political prisoner during the rule of the military junta in Brazil, enduring torture, brutality, and deprivation. His quest for spiritual initiation eventually led him deep into the heart of the rainforest, to Mapiá, where he became a teacher and leader of the Santo Daime community. He is the author of 'Forest of Visions: Ayahuasca, Amazonian Spirituality, and the Santo Daime Tradition' which has been translated into English.
 
===Paulo Roberto===

Luz na Escuridão (A Light In The Darkness) is the hinário received by Paulo Roberto (Paulo Roberto Silva e Souza), padrinho of the Céu do Mar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceudomarteste.magaweb.com.br/|title=Website of Ceu do Mar (portuguese)|accessdate=2009-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215005628/http://ceudomarteste.magaweb.com.br/|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; church in Rio de Janeiro, and who is a psychologist by training.

==Selections from Hinarios==

(often sung as part of rituals)

===Oração===

Oração simply means prayer. In Daimista communities and households, it is normally sung around 6:30pm, in church or at home, with or without instruments. The oração of CEFLURIS consists of a selection of 12 hymns from Padrinho Sebastião's O Justiceiro hinário (or hymnbook), plus one from his son Padrinho Alfredo's O Cruzeirinho hinário, and a new one from Sebastião's daughter Madrinha Nonata.

===Cura===
(Divided into parts I and II)

The Cura is a selection of 32 healing hymns in two parts, taken mainly from the hinários of Padrinho Sebastião, Madrinha Rita, and Padrinho Alfredo, but also including a few from Mestre Irineu, Alex Polari, Vera Froes and Madrinha Tetê (Teresa Gregório), often used on occasions when healing is required, in particular physical healing.
 
===Finados===

Finados is a compendium of the hinarios of Antonio Gomes, Maria Damião, Germano Guilherme and João Pereira, among the earliest followers of Mestre Irineu.

Tracing its history to an art students' cooperative founded in 1866, which grew into the museum and school, SAIC has been accredited since 1936 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]], by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] since 1944 (charter member), and by the [[Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design]] (AICAD) since its founding in 1991. Additionally it is accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]].

Its downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|AIC building]]. SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and share many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources. The campus, located in [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]], comprises chiefly three buildings: the Michigan (112 S. Michigan Ave.), the Sharp (37 S. Wabash Ave.), and the Columbus (280 S. Columbus Dr.). SAIC also owns additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used as student galleries or investments.

== History ==
The institute has its roots in the 1866 founding of the '''Chicago Academy of Design''', which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street.  It was financed by member dues and patron donations. Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]].

Because of the school's financial and managerial problems after this loss, business leaders in 1878 formed a [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] and founded the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''.  They expanded its mission beyond education and exhibitions to include collecting. In 1882, the academy was renamed the '''Art Institute of Chicago'''.  The banker [[Charles L. Hutchinson]] served as its elected president until his death in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Diane. [http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html "Art Institute of Chicago"], ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor [[Walter E. Massey]] served as president from 2010–July 2016. The current president is [[Elissa Tenny]], formerly the school's provost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/press/saic-names-elissa-tenny-president-succeed-walter-massey-effective-july-1-2016|title=SAIC Names Elissa Tenny President to Succeed Walter Massey, Effective July 1, 2016|author=|date=|website=saic.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Visiting Artists Program===
Founded in 1868, the '''Visiting Artists Program (VAP)''' is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Formalized in 1951 by Flora Mayer Witkowsky's endowment of a supporting fund, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings. It is an eclectic program that showcases artists' working in all media, including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film; in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Recent visiting artists have included [[Catherine Opie]], [[Andi Zeisler]], [[Aaron Koblin]], [[Jean Shin]], [[Sam Lipsyte]], [[Ben Marcus]], [[Marilyn Minter]], [[Pearl Fryar]], [[Tehching Hsieh]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Bill Fontana]], [[Wolfgang Laib]], [[Suzanne Lee]], and [[Amar Kanwar]] among others.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Additionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped them. Recent alumni speakers include [[Tania Bruguera]], Jenni Sorkin, Kori Newkirk, [[Maria Martinez-Cañas]], [[Saya Woolfalk]], [[Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba]], and [[Sanford Biggers]] to name a few.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Galleries===
*'''Sullivan Galleries'''- Located to the 7th floor of the Sullivan Center at 33 S. State Street. With shows and projects often led by faculty or student curators, it is a teaching gallery that engages the exhibition process as a pedagogical model and mode of research.
*'''SITE Galleries (formerly Student Union Galleries)''' - Founded in 1994, SITE, once known as the Student Union Galleries (SUGs), is a ''student-run'' organization at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) for the exhibition of ''student work''. The two central tenets of the galleries are to build relationships between different departments and stakeholders throughout the institution and strengthen our role as a teaching gallery within and beyond SAIC. This is accomplished first through providing a consistent space for undergraduate and graduate directors to organize and generate exhibitions that realize the vision of student artists. Furthermore, with strategic programming, SITE supports these exhibitions and engages evolving currents and discourses in our communities. The student-led structure provides opportunities for emerging artists and scholars to explore artistic and administrative methods by placing emphasis on collaborative processes and professional practice in and out of the classroom. They have two locations: The SITE Sharp of the 37 South Wabash Avenue building; and SITE Columbus of the 280 South Columbus Drive building. The two locations allow the galleries to cycle two shows simultaneously.  

===Student organizations===

==== ExTV ====
ExTV is a student-run time-arts platform that broadcasts online and on campus. Its broadcasts are available via monitors located throughout the 112 S. Michigan building, the 37 S Wabash building, and the 280 S. Columbus building. It is available on campus and off campus at extvsaic.org and on cantv.

====''F Newsmagazine''====
''F Newsmagazine'' is a student-run newspaper with both paid and volunteer positions. The magazine is a monthly publication with a run of 12,000 copies. Copies are distributed throughout the city, mainly at locations frequented by students such as popular diners and movie theaters.

====Free Radio SAIC====
Free Radio SAIC is the student-run Internet radio station of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Free Radio uses an open programming format and encourage its DJs to explore and experiment with the medium of live radio. Program content and style vary but generally include music from all genres, sound art, narratives, live performances, current events and interviews. [http://freeradiosaic.org]

Featured bands and guests on Free Radio SAIC include [[Nü Sensae]], [[The Black Belles]], Thomas Comerford, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/babewave/ |title=Babe Wave – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117112519/http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/babewave/ |archivedate=2014-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tarun on August 22, 2011 |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/cartoons-on-the-radio/ |title=Cartoons On The Radio – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andy on November 1, 2011 |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/interviews-with-people/ |title=Interview With Thomas Comerford – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student government====
The student government of SAIC is unique in that its constitution resembles a socialist republic, in which four officers hold equal power and responsibility. Elections are held every year. There are no campaign requirements. Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.

The student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month. At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature. The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations. Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not. The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.

The student government is also responsible for the distribution of the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Fund, Welcome Back to School Party, Monthly Morning Coffees, Open Forums, Barbecues in the Pit (the outdoor area at the entrance of the 280 S Columbus Building), Holiday Art Sale, and a Materials Event. In the past Student Government has accomplished such things as campus-wide recycling, and access to the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Universal Transit Pass|U-Pass]].

== Controversy ==

=== ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' ===
{{Main|Mirth &amp; Girth}}
On May 11,&amp;nbsp;1988, a student painting depicting [[Harold Washington]], the first black mayor of Chicago, was torn down by some of the city's African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]] — over the protests of many who attempted to block them — based on its content. The painting, titled ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' by David Nelson, was of Washington clad only in women's underwear holding a pencil.&lt;ref name="sneed_19880704"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE58EA8BDAC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Sneed, Michael |title=Untitled |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1988-07-04 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington died on November 25,&amp;nbsp;1987.

The painting was returned after a day, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. The ACLU claimed the removal violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendment rights.  Nelson ended up receiving a monetary settlement for damage to the painting which occurred during its confiscation.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1992"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven | title = Arresting Images, Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' ===

In February&amp;nbsp;1989, a student named "Dread" Scott Tyler draped the [[Flag of the United States]] across the floor&lt;!-- United States Flag Code --&gt; for a piece titled ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' The piece consisted of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag. Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1992"/&gt; The school stood by the student's art in the face of protests and threats. That year, the school's federal funding was cut from $70,000 to $1 and many benefactors pulled donations.{{citation needed|date = February 2013}}

===Academic Freedom controversy===
In 2017, a controversy arose over the resignation of [[Michael Bonesteel]], an [[Professors_in_the_United_States#Adjunct_professor|adjunct professor]] specializing in outsider art and comics after two Title IX complaints were filed. Bonesteel described the SAIC investigation as a "Kafkaesque trial" in which he was never shown copies of the complaints and in which he was guilty until proven innocent and that SAIC "feels more like a police state than a place where academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas is valued".&lt;ref name=TensionsintheArtClassroom&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/debate-over-art-teaching-and-prejudice-school-art-institute-chicago |title=Tensions in the Art Classroom |last=Roll |first=Nick |date=July  24, 2017 |website=Inside Higher Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Kipnis]], author of [[Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus|a book]] on Title IX cases, described SAIC as displaying "jawdropping cowardice" and said "The idea that students are trying to censor or curb a professor’s opinions or thinking is appalling".  &lt;ref&gt;Jori Finkel, "Art school under fire for bowing to transgender student complaints", ''The Art Newspaper'', 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bartlett, "The Offender", ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', August 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The School said the claims made against it were "problematic" and "misleading" and said it supports [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name="TensionsintheArtClassroom" /&gt;

[[File:P_S_Krøyer_1899_-_Sommeraften_ved_Skagens_strand._Kunstneren_og_hans_hustru.jpg|300px|thumb|Peder Severin Krøyer: ''Summer Evening at Skagen Beach &amp;ndash; The Artist and his Wife'' (1899)]]
'''''Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru}}) is an 1899 painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer]]. One of the best known paintings of the [[Skagen Painters]], it depicts Krøyer with his wife [[Marie Krøyer|Marie]] and his dog Rap strolling on the beach in the moonlight.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings. P.S. Krøyer arrived there in 1882, quickly becoming the most prominent member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851-1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, in a letter to his friend [[Oscar Björck]], Krøyer wrote "I am also thinking of painting a large portrait of my wife and me together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created his large painting. Maybe it was in recognition of 10 years of marriage with [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] as illustrated in other works of family life at the time as well as in a number of the photographs and sketches he used as a basis for the work.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirschsprung.dk/Image.aspx?id=12&amp;col=7|title=P.S. Krøyer i den Hirschsprungske Samling: Sommerafter ved Skagens Strand. Kunsteren og hans hustru|publisher=Hirschsprung|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting description==

The final result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Krøyer's faithful dog, Rap. After Krøyer had worked on the painting throughout the summer, he submitted it to the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung/&gt; It was not very well received there, being criticized as banal. In fact, it presents the blue half-light, a favourite with the [[Symbolists]] who believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. In 1907, Krøyer conveyed his own feelings about Skagen evenings: "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea, ... with the fishermen standing on the beach and the cutters sailing by with loosened sails ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extranet.uv.khs.dk/materiale/Dansk%20Opgave%201/www/opg4-hirschsprung/arbejder/234/index.html|title=Sommeraften ved Skagens strand|publisher=Køge Hamdelsskole|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the spring exhibition, Krøyer was admitted to Middelfart Mental Hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung/&gt;

'''''The Battle of the Milvian Bridge''''', or '''''The Battle at Pons Milvius''''', is a [[fresco]] in one of the rooms that are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]], in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] depicting the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. 

==Description==
''The Battle of Milvian Bridge'', located in the ''Sala di Costantino'' ("Hall of Constantine"), is by [[Giulio Romano]] and other assistants of the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]], who died in 1520. It was most likely painted to Raphael's design between 1520 and 1524.

After the master's death, Giulio Romano worked together with other members of Raphael's workshop to finish the commission to decorate with [[fresco]]es the rooms that are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]], in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. ''The Battle of the Milvian Bridge'' shows [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge|the battle]] that took place on 28 October 312 between the [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Constantine I]] and [[Maxentius]]. 
Legend says that Constantine had a dream where a cross appeared in the heavens; a voice told him he would win the battle of Ponte Milvio [[In hoc signo vinces|if he used the cross as his standard]]. The cross became his standard and he won the battle, and attributed his victory to the god of [[Christianity]].

The [[Ponte Milvio]] still stands in Rome in pristine condition; until only a few years ago cars were permitted to use it to cross over the Tiber. It can now be used only by pedestrians.

'''The Exploited''' are a Scottish [[hardcore punk]] band from [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, formed in 1979&lt;ref name=AllMusic1 /&gt; in Edinburgh, Scotland by Stevie Ross and Terry Buchan and later by ex-soldier [[Wattie Buchan]] (Terry's brother). They signed to [[Secret Records]] in March 1981,&lt;ref name=The-Exploited1&gt;[http://www.the-exploited.net/history.htm The Exploited +++ Real Punk Rock Since 1980]. ''The-Exploited.net''. Retrieved 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and their debut EP ''Army Life'' and debut album ''[[Punks Not Dead]]'' were both released that year.&lt;ref name=The-Exploited1/&gt; The band maintained a large cult following in the 1980s among a hardcore working class punk and skinhead audience. Although The Exploited continue to perform live to this day, they have not released any studio material since their last album ''[[Fuck the System]]'' in 2002. Their songs have been covered by [[Slayer]] and [[Ice-T]], and despite many lineup changes, Wattie has remained as the Exploited's singer and leader.

==Career==

===Formation and early days (1979–1980)===
[[File:The Exploited Logo.svg|thumb|left|220px|The Exploited logo]]
The original line-up consisted of: Terry Buchan (vocals), Stevie Ross (guitar), Colin Erskine (bass) and Andy McNiven (drums). Formed in the West [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] area of Edinburgh, a large grey [[council estate]] on the north side of the city. The band's politics was reflected in its name, coined by drummer and songwriter McNiven, whose father was a [[Korean War]] veteran and a Communist. While in the early stages as a band, with little equipment, the band were invited to play their first gig at Craigmuir School. The band seemed to be a victim of their own publicity here. They had spray-painted their band name locally and had stolen Sunday papers, milk, and rolls in the early hours of Sunday morning and redistributed them outside peoples' front door, with a note saying, "a gift from the exploited". Their first gig was on Friday 15 December 1978. The date was recalled by McNiven as it coincided with a performance by the Doomed ([[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] by another name) at Clouds in Edinburgh to which they went after performing their own gig. The gig was attended by Terry's older brother [[Wattie Buchan|Wattie]], who had recently left the army and was a punk in [[London]]. 
Wattie soon replaced Terry, and Andy McNiven and Colin Erskine were dropped from the line-up as well. Jim Park became the drummer in January 1979, first playing on February 3 1979 at the YMCA in Edinburgh, (the day after [[Sid Vicious]] died in [[New York City]]). After a few gigs in and around [[Edinburgh]], Stevie Ross left after an appearance in [[Aberdeen]] supporting the [[UK Subs]]. A few months later, he and Terry Buchan formed The Exposed. The Exposed split in 1980 after a gig supporting The Exploited. While Terry left for London, Stevie was prominent in the Edinburgh band scene during the 1980s and fronted bands like Strychnine and Burlesque before becoming lead singer with blues band Roadside Medicine. Now based in [[West Lothian]], he still sings and writes original songs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://files.nyu.edu/cch223/public/uk/exploited_main.html |title=KFTH - The Exploited Page |publisher=Files.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112913/https://files.nyu.edu/cch223/public/uk/exploited_main.html |archivedate=28 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early releases and ''Punk's Not Dead'' (1980–1981)===

Influenced by 1970s punk rock music such as music by the [[Sex Pistols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red-mag.com/RED/sep18/exploit.html |title=RED magazine |publisher=Red-mag.com |date=18 September 2003 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the quartet created a simple, no-frills sound characterized by speed and aggression. In 1980, the group founded its own [[independent record label]], Exploited Records, and released their debut EP ''Army Life'', which was #6 in the Indie/Independent charts for eight weeks, then was in the Top 20 for eighteen months.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cherryred1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=524 |title=Cherry RedRecords - Exploited, Punk's Not Dead / On Stage, Anagram |publisher=Cherryred.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112023949/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=524 |archive-date=12 January 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-side was called ''Fuck the Mods / Crashed Out'' and the record's back cover stated "To all the Edinburgh punks and skins - keep on mod-bashing!!".

They then released another single, "Barmy Army", which jumped into the independent charts and remained there for 53 weeks, peaking at #4.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Their single "Dead Cities" peaked at #31 on the UK Charts.&lt;ref name="cherryred1"/&gt; Their single "Exploited Barmy Army" peaked at #4 on the Independent/Indie {{nowrap|chart.&lt;ref name="cherryred1"/&gt;}}

In March 1981, the band signed to [[Secret Records]], and spent a month recording their debut album, ''[[Punks Not Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="reocities1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/5763/singles.htm |title=Exploited Singles Collection Page |publisher=Reocities.com |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131539/http://www.reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/5763/singles.htm |archive-date=13 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploited released the single "Dogs of War", which peaked at #2 in the Independent charts and #63 on the UK Charts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reocities1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cherryred2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/anagram-exd.asp?id=524 |title=Cherry Red Records - Exploited, Punk's Not Dead / On Stage, Anagram |publisher=Cherryred.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727230316/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/anagram-exd.asp?id=524 |archivedate=27 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1981, the band released their first live album, ''[[On Stage (The Exploited album)|On Stage]]'', recorded during a concert in Edinburgh. Thereafter, the band performed, along with [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Anti-Nowhere League]], [[Anti-Pasti]] and [[Chron Gen]] on a tour called ''Apocalypse Now'', which was recorded and released as a live album. Their album ''Punks Not Dead'', released in April 1981, went to #20 in May,&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Peter. ''The Rough Guide to Rock''. London: [[Rough Guides|Rough Guides Ltd]], 2003. pg 350. {{ISBN|1-84353-105-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then number 1 on the Independent Charts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cherryred2"/&gt; During this time, The Exploited appeared on the popular mainstream TV programme, {{nowrap|''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref name=Ian&gt;{{cite book |title=Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984 |last=Glasper |first=Ian |isbn=9781901447248 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KFtH&gt;[http://www.killfromtheheart.com/bands.php?id=2228 The Exploited] at Kill From the Heart&lt;/ref&gt;}} A lot of fans of The Exploited were unhappy with the band's decision to appear on the show.&lt;ref name=KFtH /&gt;  The hardcore punk band [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]] wrote the song ''Exploitation'' about this appearance, which began a long-standing rivalry between Conflict and The Exploited that divided the punk fan base.&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;

===''Troops of Tomorrow'', ''Let's Start a War'', and ''Horror Epics'' (1982–1986)===

The band released the albums ''[[Troops of Tomorrow]]'' in 1982, ''[[Let's Start a War]]'' in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J. Scott McClintock |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lets-start-a-warsaid-maggie-one-day-mw0000651849 |title=Let's Start a War...Said Maggie One Day - The Exploited : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Horror Epics]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/horror-epics-mw0000195522 |title=Horror Epics - The Exploited : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period between these albums was marked by severe discord over the band's musical direction: guitarist [[Big John Duncan]] and bassist Gary McCormack both left to form new bands – "bands with disco beats and guitar solos, total shit", in Wattie's words – and the band went through a rapid succession of drummers, one of whom allegedly left after a "nervous breakdown".&lt;ref name="Flipside43"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://killfromtheheart.com/interviews.php?id=89 |title=The Exploited Interview |last=Kowalewski |first=Al |authorlink= |journal=[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]] |issue=43 |date=September 1984 |publisher=Kill From The Heart |accessdate=21 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was driven away from the Secret label by new management who demanded unrealistic changes in style and personnel.&lt;ref name="Flipside43"/&gt; Their next label, a tiny enterprise named Pax Records, folded after its owner fled with all its assets.&lt;ref name="Flipside43"/&gt;  

The concert album ''Live at the White House'' was recorded in [[Washington DC]] in 1985 at the 9:30 Club and was released the following year in 1986.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; They also released the studio EP ''Jesus Is Dead'' in 1986, following up with ''Live and Loud'', a videography of The Exploited performing around Europe and in the United States.  During the tour of the USA, Wattie and Karl Morris had a fight on stage, and Karl left shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;  He was briefly replaced by Mad Mick, who then disappeared without trace.  Nigel Swanson was then appointed as the new guitarist.

===''Death Before Dishonour'', ''The Massacre'' and ''Beat the Bastards'' (1987–2001)===
"Sexual Favours", a single from the album ''[[Death Before Dishonour]]'', was released in 1987. The album only ranked in the top 200 of the Britain Alternative Music list. However, the album sold out quickly.&lt;ref name=MTV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/matt-mcguire/biography/ |title=Matt McGuire Bio &amp;#124; Matt McGuire Career |work=[[MTV]] |accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album's cover featured artwork from the American punk artist [[Pushead]], who complained that he was neither paid nor credited for the work.&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;

In 1990, The Exploited released their album ''[[The Massacre (The Exploited album)|The Massacre]]''. The album is a [[crossover thrash]] album.&lt;ref name=Massacre&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6997|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band went on to release a ''Singles Collection'' album in 1993. The Exploited also released the videography ''Live in Japan'' in 1993. Their album ''Beat the Bastards'' was released in April 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Torreano |first=Bradley |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/beat-the-bastards-mw0000184880 |title=Beat the Bastards - The Exploited : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=23 April 1996 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fuck the System'' and next album (2002–present)===
[[File:Wattie exploited2.jpg|thumb|right|220px |Wattie on stage in 2006.]]
In January 2003, the band released their album ''[[Fuck the System]]'' on Dream Catcher Records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=7364 |title=THE EXPLOITED Return To Action With 'Fuck The System' |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year, they toured in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=11618 |title=THE EXPLOITED Announce U.K. Dates |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=13055 |title=THE EXPLOITED Announce First U.S. Tour In Over A Decade |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2003, about 500 fans started a riot in [[Montreal]], Canada after an Exploited concert was cancelled due to the band not being allowed into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex |url=https://www.vice.com/read/montreal-also-hearts-riots |title=Montreal Also Hearts Riots |publisher=VICE |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blabbermouth1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=15960 |title=Cars Overturned, Set On Fire After THE EXPLOITED Cancel Concert In Montreal |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221071832/http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=15960 |archivedate=21 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479764/fans-riot-due-canceled-punk-show.jhtml |title=Fans Riot In Montreal Due To Canceled Exploited Show - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=15 October 2003 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rioters destroyed eight cars and set them on fire; broke eleven shop windows and caused other damage.&lt;ref name="blabbermouth1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The band were banned from playing in [[Mexico City]] due to the riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16290 |title=THE EXPLOITED Banned From Mexico City |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 interview, Wattie Buchan claimed that a new album was being finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzZR94bI34s |title=Interview with Wattie Buchan of The Exploited 2012 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Wattie Buchan suffered a heart attack on stage during a performance in [[Lisbon]] on the band's ''Taste of Chaos'' Tour with [[Hatebreed]] and [[Napalm Death]]. He was taken to a hospital, where he was expected to receive treatment for at least a week. The band signed a deal with [[Nuclear Blast Records]], and was to have many of its albums reissued in March 2014.

==Legacy==
The Exploited are one of the iconic bands of the [[Street punk#UK 82|UK 82]] punk movement along with [[Charged GBH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasper|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nowrap|[[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]}}.&lt;ref name=Diehl&gt;Matt Diehl, "The Young Crazed Peeling", ''My So-Called Punk: Green Day, Fall Out Boy, The Distillers, Bad Religion—How Neo-Punk Stage-Dived Into the Mainstream'', New York: Macmillan, 2007, {{ISBN|0-312-33781-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-33781-0}} p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "UK 82" came from The Exploited's song "UK 82".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk82.com/ UK82] Access date: August 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]] described The Exploited as "one of most riveting British punk rock units of the early 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/on-stage-mw0000677260 On Stage - The Exploited] - AllMusic&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Punk's Not Dead (2007 film)|2007 documentary ''Punk's Not Dead'']], both Wattie and Wullie Buchan are interviewed.  They are the only two native speakers in the documentary to be given subtitles, as many North Americans struggle to understand the [[Scots language]] used.

==Lyrical themes and gigs==
The Exploited has been controversial for their aggressive lyrics and rowdy gigs. They were considered "cartoon punks" by Ian Glasper.&lt;ref name=Glasper&gt;{{harvnb|Glasper|2004|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glasper wrote: "For many, The Exploited were the quintessential second wave punk band with their senses-searing high-speed outbursts against the system, and wild-eyed frontman Walter 'Wattie' Buchan's archetypal orange mohican."&lt;ref name="Glasper" /&gt; 

The Exploited are known for their lyrics about anarchy,&lt;ref name=Anarchist /&gt; politics&lt;ref name=AllMusic1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red-Mag /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radio /&gt; and anti-authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-exploited-mn0000759491/biography The Exploited biography] at [[AllMusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stroeja&gt;http://www.stroeja.com/?id=486&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1983 interview, The Exploited said that they were not a political band,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlwNc7IIKR0 The Exploited 1983 Interview (Wattie Buchan Karl Morris)], Punk Lives Youtube Channel&lt;/ref&gt; but their lyrics became political in the late 1980s and Wattie Buchan said in the documentary ''[[Punk's Not Dead (2007 film)|Punk's Not Dead]]'' that punk is defined by its politics.  As a band with lyrics that have anarchist themes, The Exploited's vocalist Wattie Buchan is an [[anarchist]]&lt;ref name=Nadia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montrealrampage.com/amnesia-rockfest-interview-with-wattie-buchan-the-exploited/ |title=Amnesia Rockfest Interview With Wattie Buchan of The Exploited |publisher=Nadia Blostein}}&lt;/ref&gt; and openly hates politics.&lt;ref name=Stroeja /&gt; The Exploited have made songs about former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and have expressed a disdainful view towards Thatcher.&lt;ref name=Radio /&gt;&lt;ref name=War&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r36976|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploited's song "Maggie", a song from the band's album "[[Horror Epics]]", is about Thatcher.&lt;ref name=Red-Mag /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radio.com/2013/04/08/top-5-songs-hating-on-margaret-thatcher/ |title=Top 5 Songs Hating On Margaret Thatcher |publisher=[[Radio.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploited's third studio album, "Let's Start a War... (Said Maggie One Day)", focuses on Margaret Thatcher and the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name=Mark /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radio /&gt;&lt;ref name=War /&gt; Other topics of the album are police-driven riots, war, unemployment and hopelessness.&lt;ref name=Mark /&gt;  Many songs from the mid-80s focus on the threat of [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;

The fans of The Exploited were nicknamed ''the Barmy Army''.  During the rivalry between The Exploited and Conflict, there were occasional clashes with fans of Conflict, known as "the Conflict Crew".  In addition to the anti-social behaviour of the band and some of their fans, The Exploited would often pull out of gigs at short notice in the 1980s, which led many venues to refuse to work with them.&lt;ref name=Documentary&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E Documentary on the history of the band The Exploited&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 1981 Southall riot, Oi! bands in general became associated with racism,&lt;ref name=riot&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&amp;dat=19810705&amp;id=t1YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qVIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6426,404910|title=Race riot strikes London|date=5 July 1981|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp |title=Oi! – The Truth |last=Bushell |first=Garry |year=2001 |work=Garry Bushell Uncensored |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216081325/http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp |archivedate=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baumann|first=Gerd|title=Contesting culture: discourses of identity in multi-ethnic London|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|series=Volume 100 of Cambridge studies in social and cultural anthropology|isbn=0-521-55554-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6o4xjpmOIgC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Exploited were sometimes believed to be a racist band because of Wattie's swastika tattoo, an incident in the early '80s where Wattie fought with a group of Asians in a cafe and in 1985 when "Deptford John" joined from the skinhead band [[Combat 84]].&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;  The band has denied all accusations of racism.&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;

As of August 2017, the band's website contains a history of the band that mentions some of the problems that have accompanied their gigs, such as a riot after a gig at the Rainbow in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London when [[The Jam]] were playing nearby and Wattie incited the fans to attack the Mods, and having declared onstage in Argentina that the [[Falkland Islands]] are British forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-exploited.net/history.htm History of The Exploited, Written by Morat. January 2003.  Retrieved 13 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  George Same has written about the fighting after the Finsbury Park gig in his book on modern music, ''Backward Moddy Boy''.&lt;ref&gt;George Same (2009), ''Backward Moddy Boy'', AuthorHouse, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;  In a documentary about the band, former manager Gem Howard said that he would often sneak the band out of hotels late, as they would often vandalise the hotel and steal everything that they could from the rooms.&lt;ref name=Documentary/&gt;

==Biography==

===Childhood (1848–58)===
Viktor Vasnetsov was born in the remote village of Lopyal in [[Vyatka Governorate]] in 1848, the second of the six children.&lt;ref name="smr"&gt;{{cite web | author = 
| date = | url =http://www.centre.smr.ru/win/artists/vasnec_v/biogr_vasnec1.htm
| title = Богатырь русской живописи| publisher = www.centre.smr.ru| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Mikhail Vasilievich Vasnetsov, known to be philosophically inclined, was a member of priesthood, and of scholarly dictation in the [[natural sciences]] and [[astronomy]]. His grandfather was an [[icon]] painter. Two of Mikhail Vasnetsov's three sons, Viktor and [[Apollinary Vasnetsov|Apollinary]], became remarkable painters, the third one becoming a schoolteacher. It was in Lopyal that Viktor started to paint, mostly landscapes and scenes of village life. Recalling his childhood in a letter to [[Vladimir Stasov]], Vasnetsov remarked that he "had lived with peasant children and liked them not as a [[narodnik]] but as a friend".&lt;ref name="smr"/&gt;

===Vyatka (1858–67)===
From the age of ten, Viktor studied in a seminary in Vyatka, each summer moving with his family to a rich merchant village of Ryabovo. During his seminary years, he worked for a local [[icon]] shopkeeper. He also helped an exiled [[Poland|Polish]] artist, [[Michał Elwiro Andriolli]], to execute [[fresco]]es for Vyatka's [[Alexander Nevsky]] cathedral.

Having graduated from the seminary, Viktor decided to move to [[Saint Petersburg]] to study art. He auctioned his paintings of ''Woman Harvester'' and ''Milk-maid'' (both 1867) in order to raise money required for the trip to the Russian capital.

===Saint Petersburg (1867–76)===
[[File:Vasnetsov Moving House.jpg|thumb|260px|''Moving House'', 1876]]
In August 1867 Viktor entered the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. Three years later, the [[Peredvizhniki]] movement of realist painters rebelled against the [[Academism]].

Vasnetsov befriended their leader [[Ivan Kramskoi]], referring to him as his teacher. He also became very close to his fellow student [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]].

It is ironic, but Viktor, whose name is associated with historical and mythological paintings, initially avoided these subjects at all costs. For his graphic composition of ''[[Christ]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] Before the People'', the Academy awarded a small silver medal to him.

In the early 1870s he executed a lot of [[engraving]]s depicting contemporary life. Two of them (''Provincial Bookseller'' from 1870 and ''A Boy with a Bottle of Vodka'' from 1872) won him a bronze medal at the [[World Fair]] in [[London]] (1874).

At that period he also started producing [[Genre works|genre paintings]] in oil. Such pieces as ''Peasant Singers'' (1873) and ''Moving House'' (1876) were warmly welcomed by democratic circles of Russian society.

===Paris (1876–77)===
In 1876 Repin invited Vasnetsov to join the Peredvizhniki colony in [[Paris]]. While living in France, Viktor studied classical and contemporary paintings, academist and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] alike. At that period, he painted ''Acrobats'' (1877), produced prints, and exhibited some of his works at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]]. It was in Paris that he became fascinated with fairy-tale subjects, starting to work on ''[[Ivan Tsarevich]] Riding a Grey Wolf'' and ''The Firebird''. Vasnetsov was a model for [[Sadko]] in Repin's celebrated painting ''[[:Image:Sadko.jpg|Sadko in the Underwater Kingdom]]''. In 1877 he returned to [[Moscow]].

===Moscow (1877–84)===
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[The Flying Carpet (painting)|The Flying Carpet]]'', 1880]]
In the late 1870s Vasnetsov concentrated on illustrating Russian fairy tales and the epic narrative poem [[Bylina]]s, executing some of his best known pieces: ''[[:Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|The Knight at the Crossroads]]'' (1878), ''[[Prince Igor]]'s Battlefield'' (1878),
''[[:File:Три царевны подземного царства.jpg|Three princesses of the Underground Kingdom]]'' (completed 1884 ), ''The Flying Carpet'' (1880), and ''Alionushka'' (1881).

These works were not appreciated at the time they appeared. Many radical critics dismissed them as undermining the realist principles of the [[Peredvizhniki]]. Even such prominent connoisseurs as [[Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov]] refused to buy them. The vogue for Vasnetsov's paintings would spread in the 1880s, when he turned to religious subjects and executed a series of icons for [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]] estate of his patron [[Savva Mamontov]].

===Kiev (1884–89)===
[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|260px|''Baptism of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]]'', a Vasnetsov fresco, St. Vladimir's Cathedral in Kiev]] [[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (painting)|''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'']] (1887) by Vasnetsov, St. Vladimir's Cathedral]]In 1884-1889 Vasnetsov was commissioned to paint [[fresco]]s in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|St Vladimir's Cathedral]] of [[Kiev]]. This was a challenging work which ran contrary to both Russian and Western traditions of religious paintings. The influential art critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] labelled them a sacrilegious play with religious feelings of the Russian people. Another popular critic, [[Dmitry Filosofov]], referred to these frescoes as "the first bridge over 200 years-old gulf separating different classes of Russian society".

While living in Kiev, Vasnetsov made friends with [[Mikhail Vrubel]], who was also involved in the cathedral's decoration. While they worked together, Vasnetsov taught the younger artist a great deal. It was in Kiev that Vasnetsov finally finished ''[[Ivan Tsarevich]] Riding a Grey Wolf'' and started his most famous painting, the ''[[Bogatyr]]s''.

In 1885 the painter travelled to [[Italy]]. The same year he worked on stage designs and costumes for [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s opera ''[[Snegurochka (opera)|The Snow Maiden]]''.

===Later years (1890–1926)===
[[File:1898 Vasnetsov Bogatyrs anagoria.JPG|thumb|260px|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' (1898), one of Vasnetsov's most famous paintings, depicts mythical Russian knights [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]].]]
The following two decades were productive for Vasnetsov. He increasingly turned to other media during this period. In 1897 he collaborated with his brother Apollinary on the theatrical design of another Rimsky-Korsakov premiere, ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]''.

At the turn of the century, Vasnetsov elaborated his hallmark "fairy-tale" style of [[Russian Revival]]ist architecture. His first acclaimed design was a church in [[Abramtsevo, Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, Moscow Oblast|Abramtsevo]] (1882), executed jointly with [[Vasily Polenov]]. In 1894, he designed his own mansion in [[Moscow]]. The Russian pavilion of the World Fair in [[Paris]] followed in 1898. Finally, in 1904, Vasnetsov designed the best known of his "fairy-tale" buildings — the façade of the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].

Between 1906 and 1911, Vasnetsov worked on the design of the mosaics for [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw]]; he was also involved in the design of [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Moscow]].

[[File:Stamps of Moskow Vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[revenue stamp]] of [[Russia]], 1914]]
In 1912, he was given a noble title by [[Czar Nicholas II]]. In 1914, he designed a revenue stamp intended for voluntary collection for victims of World War I.

Even prior to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Vasnetsov became active as a regent of the Tretyakov Gallery. He allocated a significant portion of his income to the [[State Historical Museum]], so that a large part of the museum's collection was acquired on Vasnetsov's money. After the [[October Revolution]] he advocated removing some of the religious paintings (notably those by [[Alexander Ivanov (painter)|Alexander Ivanov]]) from churches to the Tretyakov Gallery.

In 1915 Vasnetsov participated in the designing of a military uniform for the Victory parade of Russian army in Berlin and Constantinopole. Vasnetsov is credited with the creation of the [[budenovka]] (initially named ''bogatyrka''), a military hat reproducing the style of [[Kievan Rus'|ancient Rus']] [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]-shaped helmets.

He died in Moscow in 1926.

==Legacy==
[[File:Vasnetsov Ioann 4.jpg|thumbnail|260px|Vasnetsov's painting of Ivan the Terrible]]
A [[minor planet]] [[3586 Vasnetsov]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]] in 1978 is named after Viktor Vasnetsov and Apollinary Vasnetsov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=3575+Anyuta  | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | page = 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'', Vasnetsov's painting of [[Ivan the Terrible]] is anachronistically presented as if it already existed in that Tsar's lifetime, and as being sent by Ivan to England when he offers to marry [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

Vasnetsov's grandson was [[People's Artist of the USSR]] [[Andrei Vasnetsov]].

'''''We are Making a New World''''' is a 1918 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]].  The optimistic title contrasts with Nash's depiction of a scarred landscape created by the First World War, with shell-holes, mounds of earth, and leafless tree trunks.  Perhaps Nash's first major painting and his most famous work, it has been described as one of the best British paintings of the 20th century, and has been compared to [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.

The work was among the first oil paintings produced by Nash.   It was based on his 1918 pen-and-ink drawing ''Sunrise, Inverness Copse'', which depicts the remains of a small group of trees at Inverness Copse, near [[Ypres]] in Belgium. Both works were exhibited in a solo exhibition entitled "The Void of War" at the [[Leicester Galleries]] in May 1918.

The painting measures {{convert|71.1|xx|91.4|cm|in}}.  It depicts a bright white sun rising above ruddy brown clouds, shining beams down on a desolated green landscape below, with unnatural mounds of earth piled up between the skeletal remains of blasted trees.  Nash's style is developed from [[Cubism]] and [[Vorticism]].

== Social ==
'''Wheelchair dancing''' is a popular social and recreational activity, with participants in over 40 countries.&lt;ref name="Rogers-2001"/&gt; The physical benefits of wheelchair dancing include the maintenance of physical balance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination and improved respiratory control. The psychological effects of [[ballroom dancing]] are social interaction and the development of relationships. For social dancers, it is an opportunity to engage in a fun and a friendly event with others. For competitors, it assists in the development of fair play, sportsmanship and communication skills. Wheelchair dancing is an activity that integrates the wheelchair user and able-bodied person.&lt;ref name="Goldberg-2011"/&gt;&lt;!-- this article says more-or-less the same as the above, which is mostly common sense anyway, but was not "the" source for it --&gt;

== Courses ==
In February, 2008 the [[University of Delaware]] Collegiate DanceWheels Program was created to instruct students in wheelchair dancing. This is the first accredited course of its kind in the United States. The program was developed in conjunction with the American DanceWheels Foundation through a grant from the [[Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Buck-2008"/&gt;

[[Image:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|250px|thumb|right|William Kempe (right) from ''Nine Days Wonder'' (1600)]]
'''William Kempe''' (died 1603), commonly referred to as '''Will Kemp''', was an English actor and dancer specialising in comic roles and best known for having been one of the original players in early dramas by [[William Shakespeare]]. Roles associated with his name may include the great comic creation, [[Falstaff]], and his contemporaries considered him the successor to the great [[Jester|clown]] of the previous generation, [[Richard Tarlton]].

Kempe's success and influence was such that in December 1598 he was one of a core of five actor-shareholders in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] alongside Shakespeare and [[Richard Burbage]], but in a short time (possibly after a disagreement among the members of the troupe) he parted company with the group. Despite his fame as a performer and subsequent intent to continue his career, he appears to have died unregarded and in poverty circa 1603.

==Life==
In a 1615 lawsuit brought by Thomasina (née Heminges) Ostler, widow of [[William Ostler]], against her father, [[John Heminges]], the recently deceased actor William Kempe was referred to as a gentleman (''Willelmo Kempe nuper de Londonia generoso defuncto''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1909|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that he was a member of the Kempe family of [[Olantigh]], a property {{convert|1|mi|km}} north of [[Wye, Kent|Wye]] in [[Kent]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kemp's parentage is unknown, though it has been conjectured that, despite his plebeian performance persona, he was linked in some way to the Kempes of Ollantighe, near Ashford in Kent, who were a wealthy Catholic dynasty. Sir Thomas Kempe (1517–1591) did indeed have a son named William;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the claim that this William Kempe was the actor cannot be correct, since he was buried at Wye church on 27 March 1597 (Honneyman, 125–9; Bannerman, 3; private information, A. Findlay) . Nonetheless, this putative connection might help explain the otherwise surprising story—dramatized in the play The Travailes of the Three English Brothers (1607) by Day, Rowley, and Wilkins—that when William Kemp the actor was in Italy in 1601 he had an encounter with the celebrated traveller Sir Anthony Shirley: for Sir Anthony and his two equally famous brothers were related to the Ollantighe Kempes through their mother, who was Sir Thomas Kempe's daughter. Possibly, then, the actor had some tie of kinship to Ollantighe, at an outlying point on the family tree; or perhaps in recommending himself to Shirley he was just opportunistically taking advantage of the name he shared with Shirley's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kempe first enters the historical record as a performer with [[Leicester's Men]] at [[Essex House (London)|Leicester House]] in May 1585&lt;ref&gt;The Earl made a special payment of ten [[shilling]]s for this performance.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in this service after [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Leicester]]'s departure for the [[Low Countries]] to take part in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Leicester's nephew, [[Philip Sidney]], sent letters home by way of a man he called "Will, my Lord of Lester's jesting player" and it is now generally accepted this was Kempe. Sidney complained in a letter to [[Francis Walsingham]] that "Will" had delivered the letters to [[Lettice Knollys|Lady Leicester]] rather than Sidney's wife, [[Frances Walsingham]]. After a brief return to England, Kempe accompanied two other future Lord Chamberlain's Men, [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]] and [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], to [[Elsinore]] where he entertained [[Frederick II of Denmark]].

Kempe's whereabouts in the later 1580s are not known, but that his fame as a performer was growing during this period is indicated by [[Thomas Nashe]]'s ''An Almond for a Parrot'' (1590). Nashe dedicated this work to Kempe, calling him "vicegerent general to the ghost of Dick Tarlton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the title-page of the [[book size|quarto]] of ''A Knack to Know a Knave'' advertises Kempe's "merriments". (Because title-pages were a means to draw attention to a book, the mention of Kempe suggests that he had become an attraction in his own right.) Critics have generally viewed the scene in which Kempe performs as rather flat (Collier, 97) and it is assumed that the scene provided a framework within which Kempe could [[improvise]]. Entries in the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Register]] indicate that three jigs (short comic plays) perhaps written by Kempe were published between 1591 and 1595. Two of these have survived.

By 1592 Kempe was one of [[Lord Strange's Men]], listed in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] authorisation for that troupe to play seven miles out of London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although he had been a sharer in the plans to construct the [[Globe Theatre]], he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', in which there is no promised continued role for Falstaff, and ''[[Hamlet]]'', containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, (2005). ''1599, A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare''. Faber and Faber, London. pp.42–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hornback ''The English Clown Tradition from the Middle Ages to Shakespeare'' 1843843560 - 2013 "nd of the stupid puritan stereotype generally, that Shakespeare wrote his own strict, stupid puritan clown for Kemp — for whatever reason, Kemp's last Shakespearean role — in 1598. Like the “foolish Mayre or foolish justice” ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Kemp's Men, Chapelfield Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 167501.jpg|thumb|left| [[Wood carving]] of Kempe in Chapelfield Gardens, [[Norwich]]]]
After his departure from the Chamberlain's Men in early 1599, Kempe continued to pursue his career as a performer. In February and March 1600, he undertook what he would later call his "Nine Days Wonder", in which he [[morris dance]]d from London to [[Norwich]] (a distance of over a hundred miles) in a journey which took him nine days spread over several weeks, often amid cheering crowds. Later that year he published a description of the event to prove to doubters that it was true.&lt;ref&gt;The year Kempe gives was 1599 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], which has caused some later confusion. That Kempe's jig took place in 1600 (New Style) is established by a record of the payment of his prize money by the Norwich City Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his activities after this famous stunt are as obscure as his origins. On evidence from ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'', he is assumed to have made another European tour, perhaps reaching Italy, but by 1601 he was borrowing money from [[Philip Henslowe]] and had joined [[Worcester's Men]]. The last undoubted mention of him occurs in Henslowe's diary in late 1602.

Parish records record the death of "Kempe, a man" in ''[[Southwark St Saviour|St. Saviour]]'', [[Southwark]], late in 1603. While this is not necessarily the comedian, the record fits his departure from the documentary record.

==Performance style==
In his time, Kempe was as famous for his [[Jig (theatre)|stage jig]]s as for his acting in regular drama. The jig, a kind of rustic cousin to [[commedia dell'arte]], featured as many as five performers in a partially improvised song-and-dance routine. Jigs had plots, often bawdy, but the emphasis was on dancing and physical comedy. Two of Kempe's jigs survive in English, and two more in German. Examples of the jigs may be seen in the manuscript collection of [[John Dowland]] (now in the [[Cambridge University Library]]). A famous 17th century jig called [[Kemp's Jig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathew Holmes lute books: Kemp's jig|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-DD-00002-00011/194|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named after Will Kempe and was published in the first book of [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' of 1651. The tune has received a number of modern renditions, including those by [[Profile (Jan Akkerman album)|Jan Akkerman]] and [[Gryphon (album)|Gryphon]].

As an actor, Kempe is certainly associated with two roles: [[Dogberry]] in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Peter in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. (In the quarto text of the latter, and in both quarto and [[First Folio]] text of the former, he is identified in speech prefixes and stage directions.) From these hints, a list of Kempe's parts has been deduced which, if conjectural, is not improbable: Costard in ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'', [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Lancelot Gobbo in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and Cob in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''. [[Falstaff]] is a more ambiguous case. Though Falstaff presents some features of an Elizabethan dramatic clown, his character is higher in class and more complex than the other roles with which Kempe is associated.

==In period fiction==
*Kempe appears as a character in ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return from Parnassus, or The Scourge of Simony]]'', possibly written during his lifetime or very shortly after his death. In it he praises Shakespeare for outdoing university-educated playwrights.

==In modern fiction==

===Film and TV===
*In the 1978 TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Will Shakespeare]]'' Kempe is portrayed by [[Derek Royle]] as an oafish alcoholic. He is ousted from the troupe and replaced by [[Robert Armin]] when they think he has betrayed their involvement in the [[Essex Rebellion]]. In fact Armin is the informer, who has framed Kempe to replace him.
*In the 1998 [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', he is played by veteran [[character actor]] [[Patrick Barlow]].
*In 2005's TV-film ''[[A Waste of Shame]]'' he is portrayed by [[John Voce]].
*In the 2007 [[Doctor Who]] episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", Kempe is played by [[David Westhead]].
*In the 2016 [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', Kempe is played by [[Spencer Jones (actor)|Spencer Jones]] as a parody of modern comedian [[Ricky Gervais]].

===Literature===
*Kempe is a key character in [[Kevin Sylvester]]'s 2015 novel for young adults ''Neil Flambé and the Bard's Banquet'', published by Simon &amp; Schuster Books
*Kempe appears in Ann Young's 2002 novel for young adults ''The Nine Days Wonder'', published by East Hall Press.
*In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 1991 graphic novel [[The Sandman: Dream Country]], Kempe is depicted in the issue ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a short story about Shakespeare's first performance of the play.
*Kempe also appears in ''[[King of Shadows]]'', a 1999 children's fiction book which shows Kempe as a clown dancing a Nine Days' Morris.
*In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[alternate history]] 2002 novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' Kempe is one of the main characters. His off-stage personality is indistinguishable from the characters he plays on stage, and his antics provide much of the humour in the novel, which is set during a time of grim peril.
*In J. B. Cheaney's 2004 novel ''The True Prince'' along with more of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].
*''Kempe's Jig'' is referenced in [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s poem "After Reading ''Children of Albion'' (1969)" from his ''A Treatise of Civil Power'', published in 2007.

===Stage===
*Kempe was the title character in Dan Roentsch's play ''Will Kemp''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=zuYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22dan+roentsch%22+%22will+kemp%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q-qTsDS5Mt&amp;sig=14WNgEIw-OijU_2GKCyLscghp94&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FkidUa-NOaXY0gGC3ICQAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q="dan roentsch" "will kemp"&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]] depicts Kempe as a moody tragedian in his 1968 play ''[[A Cry of Players]]'', a significant departure from Kempe's actual performance style.

In 2008, comedian [[Tim FitzHigham]] re-enacted Kemp's Nine Day's Wonder by Morris dancing from London to Norwich, forming the basis of his play The Bard's Fool, performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tim Fitzhigham The Bard's Fool | work=Chortle  | url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2008/t/16406/tim_fitzhigham%3A_the_bards_fool |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Zvi Raphaeli''' (b. Egypt 1924, d. 2005) was an Israeli impressionist painter. A rabbi by profession, he merged religion and art deftly in his paintings. He was educated in France from the age of three, and studied art at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, and also at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem, Israel. He initially studied engineering but after losing many close relatives including his father and brother in World War II, Raphaeli decided to study to be an artist. He was a member of the [[French Resistance]] during World War II, and lived in Israel where he moved to, in 1945 at the age of 21. Later on in his life, he also lived in the United States.

== Art ==
He is known for his works of art in varied media, including oil and watercolor, depicting street scenes in Israel, scenes from Jewish life and festivities, and occasionally floral still subjects. Style: His primary medium of painting was oil on canvas, with a prominent [[impasto]] technique, that brings depth to the subject. In the 70's, Raphaeli made his stamp as an art critic as well, providing his critique to various other Israeli artists like Moshe Givati at the nationwide 'Summer ‘70 Exhibition' held at the Goldman Gallery, [[Haifa]]. Austrian born Israeli Art critic Theodore F. Meisels once wrote in the [[Jerusalem Post]]: "Still, one should watch out; Should Raphaely, who behind his beard is far younger than he looks, ever attempt to harmonize his two worlds, then this genuine painting 'Chassid' could develop into an Israeli Chagall....."

Raphaeli has also authored and illustrated the [[Haggadah]] (a Jewish text for "telling" from father to son, the story of deliverance of Jews from Egypt), in his version THE PESSACH HAGGADAH [Hardcover-1975, Miller Publication, 1975]

[[Image:0 Écorché - Paulus Pontius - SNR - 3 PONTIUS - BNF (3).jpg|thumb|upright|Écorché by [[Paulus Pontius]].]]
An '''écorché''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔʁʃe}}) is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin, normally as a [[figure study]] for another work or as an exercise for a student artist. The [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]]-era [[Renaissance architecture|architect]], theorist and all-around [[Renaissance man]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], recommended that when painters intend to depict a [[Nude (art)|nude]], they should first arrange the muscles and bones, then depict the overlying skin.&lt;ref name="artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/E.html Écorché] defined at ArtLex.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first well known [[Study (art)|studies]] of this kind were performed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who dissected [[cadavers]] and created detailed drawings of them. However, there are some accounts of this same practice taking place as far back as [[ancient Greece]], though the specifics are not known.

==Etymology==
The term ''écorché'', meaning literally "[[Flaying|flayed]]", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the [[École des Beaux Arts]]) in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="artlex" /&gt;

==History==
Although there are some accounts of practices similar to ''écorché'' as far back as [[ancient Greece]], the degree of similarity is unclear.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The term as used today can be applied with the greatest confidence to the [[Renaissance period]] onwards.

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance in Italy, around the 1450 to 1600, the rebirth of classical Greek and Roman characteristics in art led to the studies of the human anatomy. The practice of dissecting the human body was banned for many centuries due to the belief that body and soul were inseparable. It wasn’t until the election of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] that the practice of dissection was once again allowed for observation.&lt;ref name="lemire m"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=M|title=Representation of the human body: the colored wax anatomic models of the 18th and 19th centuries in the revival of medical instruction|journal=Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy|date=1 December 1992|volume=14|issue=4|pages=283–291|doi=10.1007/BF01794751|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01794751?LI=true|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginn|first=Sheryl R.|author2=Lorusso, Lorenzo|title=Brain, Mind, and Body: Interactions with Art in Renaissance Italy|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|date=16 July 2008 |volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–313|doi=10.1080/09647040701575900|pmid=18629698|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/0964704x/v17i0003/295_bmabiwairi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many painters and artists documented and even performed the dissections themselves by taking careful observations of the human body. Among them were [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andreas Vesalius]], two of the most influential artists in [[anatomical illustrations]].&lt;ref name=specbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Martin Kemp, Marina|title=Spectacular bodies : the art and science of the human body from Leonardo to now|year=2001|publisher=[[Hayward Gallery]]|location=London|isbn=0520227921|pages=22–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci, in particular, was very detailed in his studies that he was known as the “artist-anatomist” for the creation of a new science and the creative depiction to [[anatomy]].  Leonardo’s anatomical studies contributed to artistic exploration of the movement of the muscles, joints and bones. His goal was to analyze and understand the instruments behind the postures and gestures in the human body.&lt;ref name=leo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keele|first=Kenneth D.|title=Leonardo Da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy|journal=Medical History|date=October 1964|volume=8|issue=4|pages=360–370|doi=10.1017/s0025727300029835|pmid=14230140|pmc=1033412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th – 19th centuries===
The study of anatomical figures became popular among the medical academies across Europe around the 17th and 18th century, especially when there was a lack of bodies available for dissections.&lt;ref name=specbook /&gt;  Medical students relied on these figures because they provided a good representation of what the anatomical model looks like. The ''écorché'' (flayed) figures were made to look like the skin was removed from the body, exposing the muscles and vessels of the model. Some figures were created to strip away the layers of muscles and reveal the skeleton of the model. Many of the life-size scale écorché figures were reproduced in a smaller scale out of bronze that could be easily distributed.&lt;ref name=healthcare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=Harry|title=Early Use of Simulation in Medical Education|journal=[[Society for Simulation in Healthcare|Simulation in Healthcare: the Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare]]|date=1 April 2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=102–116|doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e3182415a91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Écorché'' figures were commonly made out of many different materials: bronze, ivory, plaster, wax, or wood. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wax was the most popular use of material in creating écorché statues.
