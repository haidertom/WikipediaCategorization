{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

'''Achieved status''' is a concept developed by the anthropologist [[Ralph Linton]] denoting a [[social status|social position]] that a person can acquire on the basis of merit; it is a position that is earned or chosen. It is the opposite of [[ascribed status]]. It reflects personal skills, abilities, and efforts. Examples of achieved status are being an Olympic athlete, being a criminal, or being a college professor.

Status is important sociologically because it comes with a set of rights, obligations, behaviors, and duties that people occupying a certain position are expected or encouraged to perform. These expectations are referred to as [[role]]s. For instance, the role of a "professor" includes teaching students, answering their questions, being impartial, appropriately.

==Achieved status vs. ascribed status==

[[Ascribed status]] is a position assigned to individuals or groups based on traits beyond their control, such as sex, race, or parental social status. This is usually associated with "closed" societies. Achieved status is distinguished from [[ascribed status]] by virtue of being earned.

Many positions are a mixture of achievement and ascription; for instance, a person who has achieved the status of being a physician is more likely to have the ascribed status of being born into a wealthy family. This is usually associated with "open" societies or "social" class societies.

==Social mobility==

[[Social mobility]] refers to one's ability to move their status either up or down within the [[social stratification]] system, as compared with their family’s status in early life.  Some people with achieved status have improved their position within the social system via their own merit and achievements.

Someone may also have achieved status that decreases their position within the social system, such as by becoming a notorious criminal.  In a society that one's position in that society can change due to their actions, either increase or decrease, that society can be referred to as an Open System.  A Closed System society would not allow [[Social mobility]] as easily as an Open System.

==Cultural capital==
[[Cultural capital]] is a concept, developed by sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]], that can refer to both achieved and ascribed characteristics. They are desirable qualities (either material or symbolic) that contribute to one's social status; any advantages a person has which give him/her a higher status in society.  It may include high expectations, forms of knowledge, skill, and education, among other things.

Parents provide children with cultural capital, the attitudes and knowledge that make the educational system a comfortable familiar place in which they can succeed easily.  There are other types of capital as well; [[Social capital]] refers to ones membership in groups, relationships, and networks.  It too can have a significant impact on achievement level.

===Education===
Industrialization has led to a vast increase in the possible standard of living for the average person but also made this increase necessary. For the productivity of the average worker to rise, he or she had to receive far more education and training. This successively made the average worker much less replaceable and therefore more powerful. Hence, it became necessary to satisfy workers’ demands for a larger share.

===Employment===
According to sociologist [[Rodney Stark]], few [[United States|Americans]] believe coming from a wealthy family or having political connections is necessary to get ahead. In contrast, many people in other industrialized nations think these factors are necessary for advancement. Americans are more likely than the people in these nations to rate “hard work” as very important for getting ahead. While most nations value hard work, the [[Italians]], for example, are hardly more likely to rate it as very important than they are to think one needs political connections.

===Income===
People with a lower income will generally be a better example of moving up in the [[social stratification]] and achieving status.  This holds to be evident in most cases because those who accrue a lower income usually have the motivation to achieve a greater status through their own ambitions and hard work.  Those of higher income are typically the result of achieving status.  In other cases the people of higher income may have unjustly acquired that position, or were ascribed the status and income they hold (such as monarchs, family run businesses, etc.).

Those without the privilege of ascribing their status will generally have the greater motivation of achieving their own status.  The general economic well being of the society the person lives in also tends to be another factor in their status and to what extent they are able to achieve their status.

For example, [[United States|Americans]] are less likely than people in other industrialized nations to object to current income variances. According to [[Rodney Stark]], in 1992, only twenty-seven percent of Americans strongly agreed that income disparities in their country were too large. In contrast, more than half of [[Russians]], [[Italians]], and [[Bulgarians]] agreed with this statement.

==In stratification systems around the world==

In all societies a person's social status is the result of both ascribed and achieved characteristics.  Societies differ markedly on several dimensions in this process: what attributes are used to assign status, the relative importance of ascribed versus achieved attributes, the overall potential for social mobility, the rates of mobility that actually occurred, and the barriers for particular sub-groups to enjoy upward mobility in that society.

==Cultural differences around the world==

===Medieval Europe===
One's status in [[medieval Europe]] was primarily based on ascription. People born into the noble class were likely to keep a high position and people born of peasants were likely to stay in a low position.  This political system is known as [[feudalism]] and does not allow for much [[social mobility]].

===Feudalism in Latin America===
Bolivia has had past newspaper advertisements that claimed to have land, animals and [[peasants]] for sale.  The peasants weren't necessarily slaves but placed in their [[social class]] and obligated to work due to their bind to the land they lived and farmed.  This sort of social interaction is based mainly on the people's strong belief of tradition and to uphold the actions of the past.  In 1971 [[Ernesto Laclau]] addressed the argument of whether Latin America was either under a social system of [[feudalism]] or [[capitalism]].  He determined that the social system was extremely different from the capitalistic system in [[Europe]] and America, so therefore Latin America would be more closely related to have a Feudalism approach to social interaction.

===Caste system===
{{main|Caste}}
The formation of hierarchy differs somewhere between the polarities of given and achieved status.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Invisible Race: Caste in Culture and Personality, p.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=T0_EWolOfpUC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false334], George A. De Vos, Hiroshi Wagatsuma&lt;/ref&gt; In [[caste]] systems, ascription is the overpowering basis for status. Traditional society in South Asia and other parts of the world such as Egypt, India, Japan, and others were composed of castes. Each group was limited to certain occupations. Low paying occupations such as collecting garbage, were reserved for one caste, whose members were excluded from holding any other occupation. Correspondingly, highly skilled occupations, such as being a priest, [[goldsmith]], were reserved for another caste. However, some people managed through talent and luck to rise above their given caste. For example, great aptitude as a soldier was often a way to reach a higher status.

According to AfriForum CEO, [[:af:Kallie Kriel|Kallie Kriel]], AfriForum is a  [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] initiative to mobilise civil society and specifically minority communities, in order to take part in democratic debate. Kriel further stated that AfriForum would like to achieve balance in South Africa. “True democracy needs alternative voices in order to succeed. While we aren’t a political party, we give alternative ideas and suggestions, where applicable, to the government stance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/traps/2008/04/16/afrikaner-aspirations-%E2%80%93-an-hour-with-afriforums-kallie-kriel/|title=Afrikaner aspirations: An hour with AfriForum’s Kallie Kriel|work=thoughtleader.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; AfriForum's claim to be a civil rights organisation has been questioned in the South African media,&lt;ref name="news24SisuluExaggerate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dont-exaggerate-sisulu-asks-afriforum-20180515|title=Don't exaggerate, Sisulu asks AfriForum|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citizenIronyArgument"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citizen.co.za/opinion/opinion-columns/1928535/afriforum-cant-spot-the-irony-in-its-own-whiny-argument/|title=AfriForum can’t spot the irony in its own whiny argument|publisher=The Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sowetanApartheidCrimeHumanity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-05-15-apartheid-not-a-crime-against-humanity--afriforum-ceo|title=Apartheid not a crime against humanity – AfriForum CEO|publisher=Sowetan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sundaytimesHogarth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/opinion-and-analysis/2018-05-19-mampara-of-the-week-kallie-kriel/|title=Mampara of the week: Kallie Kriel|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South African and international media often characterize Afriforum as a white nationalist or white supremacist group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/south-african-group-fire-lobbying-white-rights-180514054424008.html|title=South African group under fire for lobbying US for white rights|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45336840|title=The groups playing on the fears of a 'white genocide’|last=Chothia|first=Farouk|date=2018-09-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-south-africa-714744/|title=Trump Is Using a White Nationalist Conspiracy Theory to Inform Policy|last=Bort|first=Ryan|date=2018-08-23|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/23/17772056/south-africa-trump-tweet-afriforum-white-farmers-violence|title=Trump’s tweet echoing white nationalist propaganda about South African farmers, explained|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/south-africa-afriforum-trump-kiss-death-180828131030337.html|title=South Africa's Afriforum and Trump's kiss of death|last=Msimang|first=Sisonke|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's [[youth wing]] is called ''AfriForum Youth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforumyouth.co.za/who-are-we/beleid/|title=Home - AfriForum Jeug|work=AfriForum Jeug}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mgHETNslams"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2013-09-30-hten-slams-afriforums-student-race-request|title=HETN slams AfriForum's student race request|first=Bongani|last=Nkosi|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AfriForum was founded in 2006. AfriForum's Civil Rights Charter was officially adopted by the organization on 7 September 2006 during a discussion forum held in Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforum.co.za/about/project-100-000|title=AfriForum|work=AfriForum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}} Its leader, Kallie Kriel, was previously a member of the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]], and a leader of the [[Freedom Front Plus]] (FF+) youth wing, and a large number of its executive leadership were formerly associated with Freedom Front Plus.&lt;ref name="thlaff"/&gt;

The organisation recruited its 100 000th member in July 2014  and its 200 000th member in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afriforum.co.za/afriforum-enters-new-phase-200-000-active-members/|title=AfriForum enters new phase with 200 000 active members - AfriForum|date=2017-11-01|work=AfriForum|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

==Campaigns and policies==
[[File:AfriForum - Standerton-betoging.jpg|thumb|left|AfriForum protest outside the [[Pretoria High Court]]]]
The organisation's principal focus is inter alia on the following areas: civil, safety and security, community affairs, local government, environmental affairs, education as well as preserving the language, culture and heritage in South Africa.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 2009, the group contested the presence of [[Robert Mugabe]] at the inauguration of [[Jacob Zuma]]'s presidency.&lt;ref name=gsd&gt;{{cite web|title=Great song and dance as Zuma is sworn in as president of South Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/07/south-africa-zuma-president-inauguration|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also involved in a bid to prevent the delivery of [[Alouette III]] Air Force helicopters to the [[Zimbabwe Army|Zimbabwean army]].&lt;ref name=zimheli&gt;{{cite web|title=AfriForum wins bid to halt Zim helicopter delivery|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-01-26-afriforum-wins-bid-to-halt-zim-helicopter-delivery|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has opposed [[fracking]] in the [[Karoo]]&lt;ref name="tkag"&gt;{{cite web|title=TKAG, Afriforum become anti-fracking force |url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/73896-1021-53-TKAG_Afriforum_become_antifracking_force |publisher=The New Age Online |accessdate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116072223/http://www.thenewage.co.za/73896-1021-53-TKAG_Afriforum_become_antifracking_force |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as poaching&lt;ref name="iol.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/fury-as-poaching-charges-dropped-1.1270893|title=Fury as poaching charges dropped|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also campaigned against [[e-toll (South Africa)|electronic road tolling in Gauteng]].&lt;ref name=etollsnao&gt;{{cite web|title=E-toll notification unlawful: AfriForum |url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=71296&amp;cat_id=1099 |publisher=The New Age Online |accessdate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116072520/http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=71296&amp;cat_id=1099 |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has been a vocal critic of the [[ANC]]'s response to the [[South African farm attacks|farm attack]] cases, claiming that the party bears a responsibility for "remain[ing] silent" about the violence,&lt;ref name=blamfm&gt;{{cite web|title=AfriForum blames ANC for farm murders|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/09/12/afriforum-blames-anc-for-farm-murders|publisher=Times LIVE|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lodging a complaint to the [[South African Human Rights Commission]] against the [[Department of Police (South Africa)|Police Minister]] for failing to do enough to protect farmers.&lt;ref name=farmiol&gt;{{cite web|title=Afriforum takes farm murders to SAHRC|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/afriforum-takes-farm-murders-to-sahrc-1.1524798|publisher=IOL.co.za|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum launched the book ''Kill the Boer''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.killtheboerbook.com/reviews/|title=Reviews - Kill the Boer Book|work=Kill the Boer Book|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ernst Roets]], Deputy CEO of AfriForum, on 28 June 2018.&lt;ref name="Hlatshaneni"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hlatshaneni |first1=Simnikiwe |title=Outrage surrounds book claiming top ANC officials ‘killed the boer’ |url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1964479/outrage-surrounds-book-claiming-top-anc-officials-killed-the-boer/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=The Citizen |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime and corruption===
The organisation has often criticised government for its lack of willingness to address the problem of farm murders. AfriForum is of the opinion that farm murders should be declared a priority crime, and has raised widespread local awareness and increasing international awareness of the problem by means of several campaigns, including the ‘Stop the Murders’ campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=310483&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71654|title=Make farm murders a priority crime (like rhino poaching) - AfriForum - PARTY - Politicsweb|work=politicsweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}  The organisation has also campaigned to address the overall problem of crime and corruption, especially with regard to municipal employees guilty of fraud.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

====Private prosecutions====
{{see|Gerrie Nel}}
The organisation formed a [[private prosecution]]s unit, headed by well-known former state prosecutor [[Gerrie Nel]], amid allegations that the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] (NPA) was selective in prosecutions, and politically biased.&lt;ref name="conversationHowPrivateProsecutionsWillWork"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-south-africas-first-private-prosecutions-unit-will-work-72389|title=Explainer: how South Africa's first private prosecutions unit will work|last=Feldhaus|first=Chantelle|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Nel undertook to assist the victim of an alleged assault by [[Grace Mugabe]], wife of [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesouthafrican.com/gerrie-nel-takes-on-grace-mugabe-will-assist-alleged-assault-victim/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nehandaradio.com/2017/08/17/gerrie-nel-sets-sights-grace-mugabe/|title=Gerrie Nel sets sights on Grace Mugabe – Nehanda Radio|date=2017-08-17|work=Nehanda Radio|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesouthafrican.com/as-gerrie-nel-targets-grace-mugabe-we-remember-the-bulldogs-biggest-cases/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, AfriForum undertook a private prosecution of EFF leader Julius Malema on charges of fraud and corruption, after the NPA failed to continue prosecuting the case.&lt;ref name="iolMalemaAfriForumExplainsCase"/&gt; AfriForum had initially laid the charges against Malema in 2011.&lt;ref name="iolMalemaAfriForumExplainsCase"&gt;

AfriForum committed to undertake a private prosecution of Duduzane Zuma, son of then-President [[Jacob Zuma]], for [[culpable homicide]], after a vehicle driven by Duduzane Zuma was involved in a 2014 motor vehicle crash that killed two black female [[minibus taxi]] commuters, and the National Prosecuting Authority declined to prosecute, despite an inquest finding that the crash was caused by Zuma's negligence.&lt;ref name="ewnBLfConfrontKriel"&gt;http://ewn.co.za/2018/07/12/blf-confront-afriforum-s-kriel-after-duduzane-zuma-court-appearance&lt;/ref&gt; Following AfriForum's move to privately prosecute Zuma, the National Prosecuting Authority decided to pursue a prosecution instead.&lt;ref name="ewnStrongCaseZuma"&gt;http://ewn.co.za/2018/07/12/gerrie-nel-afriforum-has-strong-case-against-duduzane-zuma&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation undertook a prosecution of the chairperson of the [[National Council of Provinces]], [[Thandi Modise]], after allegations of [[animal cruelty]] at her [[North West (South Africa)|North West]] farm, where, in 2014, the [[NSPCA]] found "scores" of animals starving to death from apparent neglect, and the NPA failed to prosecute her.&lt;ref name="encaScoresModise"&gt;http://www.enca.com/scores-dead-animals-found-thandi-modises-farm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news24ToProsecuteModise"&gt;https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/afriforum-to-privately-prosecute-thandi-modise-20180719&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ewnTakeOnCruelty"&gt;http://ewn.co.za/2018/07/19/afriforum-to-take-on-thandi-modise-for-animal-cruelty&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education, language and culture===
Two of the core objectives of AfriForum Youth have been the promotion of multilingualism&lt;ref name=tra&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trapido |first1=Michael |title=No country for Afrikaans then? |url=http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/traps/2008/07/16/petty-apartheid-revisited/|website=thoughtleader.co.za |publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian |date = July 16, 2008 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mother tongue education in South Africa, and for youth in the country to be exempted from [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforumyouth.co.za/?page_id=13|title=Home - AfriForum Jeug|work=AfriForum Jeug}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

AfriForum has strongly opposed the proposed renaming of South Africa's capital from [[Pretoria]] to Tshwane, as well as street renaming in Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;SABC News, AfriForum takes Pretoria street name-changes to court, 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/81-against-Pretoria-name-change-20130414|title=81% against Pretoria name change|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign against racial quotas in higher education saw AfriForum Youth members paint themselves black to protest the alleged discrimination against 30 learners who were turned away from the [[University of Pretoria]].&lt;ref name=dmblp&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis: AfriForum Youth's absurd black paint protest|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-01-30-analysis-afriforum-youths-absurd-black-paint-protest/#.UtVCefYfvMg|publisher=Daily Maverick|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another campaign protesting racial quotas involved charging students of different races different prices for a cup of coffee, with white students paying R5 a cup, coloured and Indians R3, and blacks R1.&lt;ref name=affcoffee&gt;{{cite web|title=Afriforum Youth to offer blacks cheaper coffee|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2013/04/25/afriforum-youth-to-offer-blacks-cheaper-coffee|publisher=Times LIVE|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 AfriForum attempted to suppress a report into a [[Nazism|Nazi]]-style initiation ceremony at the Potchefstroom Campus of [[North-West University]], claiming that the report discriminated against Afrikaners.&lt;ref name="2014CityPressNaziReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Nazi-report-AfriForum-Youth-threatens-varsity-council-with-Equality-Act-20150429|title=Nazi report: AfriForum Youth threatens varsity council with Equality Act|publisher=City Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum continues to drive campaigns to, amongst other things, promote mother tongue education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/01/17/afrikaans-schools-have-a-right-to-be-here-afriforum_a_23335475/|title='Afrikaans Schools Have A Right To Be Here' -- AfriForum|date=2018-01-17|work=HuffPost South Africa|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; keep religion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-06-28-mixed-reaction-to-courts-ruling-against-single-religion-schools/|title=Mixed reaction to court’s ruling against single-religion schools|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in schools, and combat detrimental policies and regulations within the schooling system. 

The group recently condemned Gauteng MEC for Basic Education [[Panyaza Lesufi]]’s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/youre-defending-your-territory-not-a-language-lesufi-tells-afriforum-20160602|title=You’re defending your territory, not a language, Lesufi tells AfriForum|work=CityPress|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; newly proposed school regulations{{clarify|date=September 2018}} and says that the minister continues playing a political game at the expense of learners.{{fact|date=September 2018}} AfriForum further stated that Lesufi was waging a war on Afrikaans schools.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

===Land===
{{see|Land reform in South Africa|South African farm attacks}}
The [[South African Institute of Race Relations]] (SAIRR) stated that land is a contentious issue in South Africa, and that the ruling ANC party is blaming whites for still owning 80% of the total land surface. In fact, the Government’s own land-ownership documentation shows that by the start of 2011 roughly 50% of all land was in the hands of Government and black communities.{{Original research inline|date=May 2018}}

As of March 2011, 31 million hectares or 25% of the 122 million hectares surface area of South Africa were in the hands of the State.  The remaining 91 million hectares or 75% of the surface area was privately owned.  The bulk of white-owned land is probably in the hands of commercial farmers, South Africa's food producers. Their numbers are dwindling rapidly. There are only an estimated 30 000 to 40 000 of these farmers left, down from 60 000 fifteen years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71639?oid=282525&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71639.|title=How much of SA's land is really in black hands? - OPINION - Politicsweb|work=politicsweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South African President, [[Jacob Zuma]] called for a review of the land policy, echoing the contents of the Green Paper on Land Reform, but AfriForum claims that the president’s statement regarding the review of willing buyer, willing seller principle as stated in Section 25 of the South African Constitution, as a means to speed up the land restitution process was misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/06/27/afriforum-slams-zuma-land-comments|title=AfriForum slams Zuma land comments|author=Sapa|work=Times LIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AfriForum has in the past joined the South African Progressive Civic Organisation (Sapco), a Khoisan community, in a protest over the land rights of the indigenous group, with both minority groups feeling they have no representation in the current government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-02-22-afriforum-joins-khoisan-in-land-rights-fight|title=AfriForum joins Khoisan in land rights fight|work=dailymaverick.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2012, AfriForum's legal team represented the legitimate owners of land in the black community of Wallmansthal, North of Pretoria, in the North Gauteng High Court to take back their land from [[crime|illegal]] [[squatting|squatters]]. The court ruled in favour of AfriForum. The squatters, who occupied the land between December 2011 and February 2012, were removed from the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/mobi/Detail.aspx?NewsID=47994&amp;CatID=1009 |title=Eviction order for land invaders given go-ahead |work=thenewage.co.za |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821041728/http://www.thenewage.co.za/mobi/Detail.aspx?NewsID=47994&amp;CatID=1009 |archivedate=2014-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a submission on 6 September 2018 to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee charged with reviewing Section 25 of the Constitution, AfriForum argued that the ANC/EFF alliance’s{{dubious|date=September 2018}} initiative to carry through expropriation without compensation was nothing but an attempt to centralise as much power as possible in the State, and that the leaders of this policy had no respect for the pleas of poor South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/you-are-drunk-on-the-ideology-of-the-ndr--ernst-ro|title=You are drunk on the ideology of the NDR - Ernst Roets - DOCUMENTS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-source-inline|date=September 2018}}

In his submission on behalf of AfriForum, Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, argued that the campaign of the ANC and its alliance partner, the EFF, was built on a series of false arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2018-09-06-afriforum-bemoans-fallacy-that-whites-stole-the-land/|title=AfriForum bemoans ‘fallacy that whites stole the land’|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum unleashed a media and public storm when they published a list of farms that are said to be targeted by the government for expropriation without compensation that the organisation received from an anonymous source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/this-is-the-list-of-farms-targeted-for-ewc--afrifo|title=This is the list of farms targeted for EWC - AfriForum - DOCUMENTS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organisation received a backlash from some organisations and political parties regarding the legitimacy of the list, the South African Institute for Race Relations confirmed and corroborated the legitimacy of the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/land-expropriation-list-released-by-afriforum-is-legitimate-irr-20180814|title='Land expropriation list released by AfriForum is legitimate' – IRR|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoot the Boer case and hate speech===
AfriForum Youth opened a civil case against former ANC Youth League President (ANCYL), Julius Malema, in the [[Equality Court]] after his repeated singing of the words “dubul’ ibhunu”, which translate as “shoot the boer”, at a number of ANC Youth League gatherings.&lt;ref name=shtbs&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC youth leader denies hatred in 'Shoot the boer' song|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/20/julius-malema-hate-speech-boer|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Colin Lamont ruled in the South Gauteng High Court that the song constituted [[hate speech]] and undermined the dignity of Afrikaners, and was discriminatory and harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-12-shoot-the-boer-its-hate-speech-says-judge|title='Shoot the boer': It's hate speech, says judge|author=Staff Reporter, Sapa-AFP|work=The M&amp;G Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stbban&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC Julius Malema's Shoot the Boer ruled 'hate speech'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14878102|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, AfriForum and the ANC reached a settlement before the appeal case was due to be argued in the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] (SCA) in [[Bloemfontein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Shoot-the-Boer-appeal-canned-20121031-2|title=Shoot the Boer appeal canned|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has also brought charges of hate speech against individuals, among others Ronald Lamola, the then acting president of the ANC Youth League following a complaint regarding Lamola's remarks that the ANCYL could no longer guarantee the safety of the Van der Merwes and Van Tonders (traditional white Afrikaans family names) if white South Africans refused to voluntarily give up their land and mineral rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/hate-speech-charge-laid-against-lamola-20120709-2/ |title=Hate speech charge laid against Lamola |work=News24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211202232/http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/hate-speech-charge-laid-against-lamola-20120709-2/ |archivedate=2012-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013 AfriForum Youth brought a complaint of hate speech against Jason Mfusi, the leader of SASCO (The South African Students Congress) of the North-West University for his remark: "My grandfather says 'n goeie boer is 'n dooie boer", translated as “My grandfather says a good farmer is a dead farmer” which he posted on the social network, Facebook. The youth organisation reached an agreement with the SASCO leader by means of a mediation process, as requested by the Human Rights Commission (HRC) of the University. In terms of the agreement, Mfusi had to issue a written apology to the farming community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2013/02/07/nwu-student-in-trouble-over-facebook-posting|title=NWU student in trouble over Facebook posting|author=Tebogo Monama|work=Sowetan LIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum adopted a similar stance towards the word [[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]], stating that its use is a "gross human rights violation".&lt;ref name=sabckword&gt;{{cite web|title=AfriForum reaffirm stance on use of K-word amid racist saga|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/aa9441804fe8018d8628e60b5d39e4bb/AfriForum-reaffirm-stance-on-use-of-K-word-amid-racist-saga|publisher=SABC News|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Minority rights===
AfriForum regularly seeks international platforms to speak to the international community regarding the minority rights situation in South Africa. AfriForum has on several occasions attended the [[United Nations]]' [[Human Rights Council]]'s Forum on Minority Issues in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] regarding minority rights in South Africa. AfriForum has also been a delegate to a conference of the United Nations’ (UN) Human Rights Council regarding the prevention of the incitement of hatred on the grounds of nationality, race or religion.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

AfriForum has on numerous occasions criticised the ruling ANC about the denial of minority rights in the country.{{fact|date=May 2018}} However, City Press journalist Adriaan Basson (now editor of the Afrikaans daily newspaper, Beeld) has accused the organisation of overreacting to the situation regarding minority rights in South Africa. Basson has mentioned in an open letter to AfriForum CEO, Kallie Kriel, that the premise of AfriForum’s campaigns is one of victimhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/White-first-African-second-20110926|title=White first.

Afriforum claimed credit for taking an [[Australia]]n journalist on a tour of South Africa, and for the "dozens" of articles that subsequently appeared in the Australian media&lt;ref name="forumNuusUsaTour"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forumnuus.co.za/afriforum-se-kriel-en-roets-na-vsa-vir-bewusmaking-oor-plaasmoorde-en-onteiening/|title=AfriForum se Kriel en Roets na VSA vir bewusmaking oor plaasmoorde en onteiening|trans-title=Afriforum's Kriel and Roets travel to USA to raise awareness of farm murders and expropriation|quote= After an Australian journalist visiting South Africa was taken on a tour of South Africa by Afriforum, literally dozens of articles appeared in the Australian media about farm murders and the ANC government's misjudgment on property rights |publisher=Forum Nuus|date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffPoDuToirPlayingWithFire"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/pieter-du-toit/afriforums-u-s-adventure-playing-with-fire-after-setting-australia-alight_a_23426470/|title=AfriForum's U.S. Adventure: Playing With Fire, Just Like In Oz|date=4 May 2018|publisher=Huffington Post South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included claims that white South Africans were "trapped like frogs in boiling water"&lt;ref name="southAfricaAntiWhiteFrankChung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smhDigIn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/africa/white-south-african-farmers-dig-in-against-deadly-persecution-20180317-p4z4vx.html|title=White South African farmers dig in against deadly 'persecution'|date=17 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stating that white farmers were being “persecuted” because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/six-hours-of-torture-for-the-keys-to-an-empty-safe/news-story/2497280df1b18c31f55344d9f2dcf8f4|title=Killed because you’re white|date=17 March 2018|publisher=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="southAfricaAntiWhiteFrankChung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/south-africans-trapped-like-frogs-in-boiling-water-as-racial-violence-escalates/news-story/6882cebcd8d518cf949bb861b617d8ac|title=‘It is a very, very violent country’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smhDigIn"/&gt; AfriForum also undertook a tour of the United States that included meetings with [[John R.

=== Racism ===
{{Advert|section|date=September 2018}} 
On 11 September 2018, AfriForum founded a unit against racism and hate speech. Roleplayers who have committed themselves to act as advisors on this unit include: Dr Frans Cronje, CEO of the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), The civil rights activist Rhoda Kadalie, Adv. Mark Oppenheimer, expert in freedom of speech and hate speech and Dr Llewellyn Curlewis, criminal law expert, explained the legal remedies available to citizens to fight racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/afriforum-launches-anti-racism-unit-20170911|title=AfriForum launches anti-racism unit|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum submitted criminal charges against two police officials and a former member of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in January 2018 after they used social media to incite farm attacks and/or romanticise violence against farmers and minorities. AfriForum says that these incidents can be considered a form of complicity by the South African government and that it urgently needs to be tackled by the police to ensure that those responsible are prosecuted. Mseleni Mogolwane Gwabeni, who is a member of the SAPS according to his Facebook profile, said on this social media platform “then we must continue to kill more of their farmers at least to make up for what they did to us [sic]”. Chris Gumotso, who works at the SAPS youth crime prevention desk according to his Facebook profile, placed the following on Facebook: “All white man…deserve to die…in future..f*©k u..Mr white man.” He also placed photos of firearms on his police desk on his profile with this quote: “I predict th civil war.. in mzansi…by 2019…take out ur guns…fighters coz Asijiki [sic].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/afriforum-lays-criminal-charges-against-police-officials-2018-06-18|title=AfriForum lays criminal charges against police officials|work=Polity.org.za|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 AfriForum submitted criminal charges against a 100 social media users for incitement of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1554475/afriforum-to-lay-charges-against-these-100-social-media-users/|title=AfriForum to lay charges against these 100 social media users|last=reporter|first=Citizen|work=The Citizen|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has been consistent in condemning both white on black and black on white racism. The organisation released media statements in which they address racist incidents involving amongst others Penny Sparrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/south-africans-have-double-standards-when-it-comes-to-racism-afriforum-20170216|title=South Africans have double standards when it comes to racism - AfriForum|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darren Scott,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ewn.co.za/2011/09/08/AfriForum-welcomes-Darren-Scotts-apology|title=AfriForum welcomes Darren Scott's apology|last=News|first=Eyewitness|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Roodt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/AfriForum-condemns-racist-Dan-Roodt-20141113|title=AfriForum condemns 'racist' Dan Roodt|date=2014-11-13|access-date=2018-09-26|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Catzavelos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-08-22-afriforum-condemns-use-of-k-word-by-catzavelos-urges-consistency-in-condemnation-of-racism-from-all-sides/|title=AfriForum condemns use of k-word by Catzavelos‚ urges consistency in condemnation of racism from all sides|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kommandokorps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Kommandokorps-denies-racism-20120227|title=Kommandokorps denies racism|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation frequently condemns double standards in South Africa when it comes to dealing with racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/vicki-momberg-sentencing-confirms-double-standards|title=Vicki Momberg: Absurd double standards being applied – AfriForum - POLITICS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{primary-source-inline|date=September 2018}}

==Community affairs==

===Local government===
This department addresses municipal service delivery problems in over 125 towns and cities across South Africa.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In order to achieve this goal, AfriForum attempts to establish partnerships with municipalities.  The organisation allegedly submits wish lists to municipalities, and municipalities convert it into action plans to address issues. AfriForum says if municipalities do not cooperate in improving service delivery to residents, the organisation approaches courts to order municipalities to enforce service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/afriforum-statement-by-afriforum-minority-civil-organisation-brings-application-to-retain-electricity-supply-to-klerksdorp-and-jouberton-22022013-2013-02-22|title=AfriForum: Statement by  AfriForum, minority civil organisation, brings application to retain electricity supply to Klerksdorp and Jouberton (22/02/2013)|work=Polity.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

An example of intervention by AfriForum in this regard, was the urgent order awarded to the organisation against the Vhembe District Municipality by the [[High Court]] in [[Pretoria]], forcing the municipality to supply water to [[Makhado]] residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/afriforum-wins-fights-for-water-1.1394477|title=Afriforum wins fights for water|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar case in 2013, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria granted AfriForum an order stopping the Madibeng Municipality from cutting electricity supply to Hartbeespoort.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 2010 a legal team for AfriForum representing farmers in [[Zimbabwe]] won a court bid to sue Zimbabwe's government over its “cruel” and “vengeful” [[expropriation]] of South African-owned farms. In 2008 the regional court SADC tribunal ruled that Zimbabwe's [[land reform]] was illegal and racist, and that those who had suffered discrimination by having their farms expropriated had the right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/afriforum-wins-first-round-in-zimbabwe-case-1.470355|title=Afriforum wins first round in Zimbabwe case|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum's local government interventions have been described positively, even by its critics.&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt;

===Community safety===
{{Advert section|date=May 2018}}
AfriForum’s Community Safety Department participates in endeavours which promote the safety of citizens within communities. A large emphasis is placed on assisting communities and neighbourhoods to establish safety structures. Some of these structures include neighbourhood watches, farm watches, radio networks and community forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/afriforum-statement-by-reg-crewe-afriforum-head-of-community-safety-vryburg-launches-community-patrols-05112012-2012-11-05|title=AfriForum: Statement by Reg Crewe, Afriforum Head of Community Safety, Vryburg launches community patrols (05/11/2012)|work=Polity.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

In 2011 AfriForum commissioned Professor Rudolph Zinn of UNISA to conduct research into successful community safety structures in South Africa. The research has led to the compilation of a community safety handbook that has been implemented in all AfriForum branches countrywide.
The department also focuses on the role of government and in particular that of law enforcement agencies, and acts as a pressure group so that citizens get the best safety and security possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforum.co.za/english/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/report-community-safety-networks.pdf|title=AfriForum|work=AfriForum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

==Controversies==
In 2015 AfriForum asserted that allegations of racism{{clarify|date=May 2018}} against Curro Foundation School are themselves racist. In a statement by the organisation's chair it was said "To portray an Afrikaans class being transported as class group falsely as racial segregation, is beyond absurd". An investigation into the matter came to the conclusion that the class was in fact segregated racially as was alleged because white parents had pressured the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/School-racism-allegations-are-racist-Afriforum-Youth-20150618|title=School racism allegations are 'racist' - Afriforum Youth|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of AfriForum protestors were found by judge AJ Donen to have engaged in "assault, sexual violence, sexual aggression and intimidation" at Stellenbosch University,&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt; and the organisation initiated a boycott of Afrikaans newspapers that reported on Potchefstroom students that gave the [[Nazi salute]] during their initiation.&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt;

In 2016 AfriForum supporters protested in Pretoria together with the political party [[Freedom Front Plus]]'s members because Steve Hofmeyr's scheduled event at Café Dudok, a restaurant in the Netherlands, was cancelled when the organisers were alerted of his alleged white supremacy by a left-wing group in Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/hofmeyr-defended-in-dutch-caf-snub-2028898|title=Hofmeyr defended in Dutch café snub|publisher=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 eight students affiliated with AfriForum youth wing were suspended from [[Stellenbosch University]] Student Representative Council (SRC) elections after allegations of campaign irregularities. Posters that they produced and hanged around the campus were removed after they were deemed controversial and harmful to other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/8-afriforum-students-suspended-from-stellenbosch-src-elections-20160802|title=8 AfriForum students suspended from Stellenbosch SRC elections|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, following criticism of Afriforum by a [[North-West University]] professor, Elmien du Plessis,&lt;ref name="afriforumStatsDuPlessis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afriforums-own-farm-murder-stats-dont-support-their-claims-20180507|title=AfriForum's own farm murder stats don't support their claims|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afriforum's deputy CEO, Ernst Roets, posted a YouTube video where he quoted [[Victor Klemperer]], stating that "if the tables were turned after the Holocaust he "would have all the intellectuals strung up, and the professors three feet higher than the rest; they would be left hanging from the lamp posts for as long as was compatible with hygiene."&lt;ref name="huffPoHevyWeightAttack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/05/06/afriforum-heavyweight-launches-attack-on-academic-over-criticism-about-us-tour_a_23428355/|title=AfriForum Heavyweight Launches Attack On Academic Over Criticism About US Tour|date=6 May 2018|publisher=Huffington Post South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the video posting, du Plessis and her family received threats of violence.&lt;ref name="huffPoProfThreatened"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/05/07/professor-threatened-after-afriforum-criticism-dont-get-too-comfortable-youre-next_a_23429098/|title=Professor Threatened After AfriForum Criticism: 'Don't Get Too Comfortable, You're Next'|date=8 May 2018|publisher= Huffington Post South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news24ThreatsViolenceHanging"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/varsity-prof-on-afriforums-angry-roets-threat-of-violence-hanging-not-acceptable-20180507|title=Varsity prof on AfriForum's 'angry' Roets: 'Threat of violence, hanging not acceptable'|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="habibHitsOutAfriforum"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/p2-academic-adam-habib-hits-out-at-disgusting-afriforum-leaders-20180510|title=Academic Adam Habib hits out at 'disgusting' AfriForum leaders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition condemning the threats against academics was subsequently circulated.&lt;ref name="huffPocademicPetitionCirculated"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/05/14/petition-against-afriforum-over-threat-to-academics_a_23434037/|title=Petition Against AfriForum Over Threat To Academics|date=14 May 2018|publisher=Huffington Post South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel attracted widespread controversy in May 2018 when he denied that [[Apartheid]] was a [[Crime of apartheid|crime against humanity]],&lt;ref name="mgMay2018KrielApartheidCrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-05-14-i-dont-think-apartheid-was-a-crime-against-humanity-afriforums-kallie-kriel|title=I don't think apartheid was a crime against humanity – Afriforum’s Kriel|first=Mashadi|last=Kekana|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citizenKrielApartheidCrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/news-cns/1926171/apartheid-was-not-a-crime-afriforum/|title=Apartheid was not a crime – AfriForum|first=Robinson|last=Nqola|publisher=The Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="702ApartheidCrimeKriel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.702.co.za/articles/303461/i-dont-think-apartheid-was-a-crime-against-humanity-kriel|title=AfriForum's Kallie Kriel: I don't think apartheid was a crime against humanity|website=702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news24ApartheidCrimeKriel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/apartheid-was-not-a-crime-against-humanity-afriforum-ceo-20180514|title=Apartheid was not a crime against humanity - AfriForum CEO|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iolKrielCrimeHumanity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/apartheid-no-crime-against-humanity-says-afriforums-kriel-14973712|title=Apartheid no crime against humanity, says AfriForum's Kriel|publisher=IOL News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="timesLiveUproarApartheid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-05-15-uproar-over-remark-that-apartheid-was-not-a-crime-against-humanity-by-afriforum-ceo/|title='Apartheid was not a crime against humanity': AfriForum CEO's remark sparks outrage|publisher=Times Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesLiveWhoIsKriel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-05-15-who-is-afriforum-ceo-kallie-kriel/|title=Who is AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel?|publisher=Times Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iolKrielTryingToRevise"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/kriel-trying-to-revise-history-14998001|title='Kriel trying to revise history'|publisher=Pretoria News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its deputy leader Ernst Roets has described Apartheid as a "wooly concept".&lt;ref name="huffPoParallelState"/&gt; The organisation had previously described Apartheid as a "so-called historical injustice".&lt;ref name="huffPoFerialMorake"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/ferial-haffajee/ferial-haffajee-tumi-morake-solidarity-and-21st-century-baasskap_a_23216514/|title=Ferial Haffajee: Tumi Morake, Solidarity And 21st Century Baasskap|date=20 September 2017|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sowetanApartheidCrimeHumanity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="businessDayApartheidCrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2018-05-15-apartheid-not-a-crime-against-humanity--says-afriforum-ceo-kallie-kriel/|title=Apartheid not a crime against humanity, says AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel|publisher=Business Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The organisation has been criticized, most notability by the ruling ANC as well as by media outlets such as City Press, including the paper’s editor Ferial Haffajee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/Columnists/Laager-mentality-is-a-load-of-bull-20101002/ |title=Laager mentality is a load of bull |work=News24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119232400/http://www.citypress.co.za/Columnists/Laager-mentality-is-a-load-of-bull-20101002 |archivedate=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and academics such as University of Cape Town Professor Pierre de Vos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/how-not-to-engage-in-a-battle-of-ideas/|title=How not to engage in a battle of ideas|work=constitutionallyspeaking.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivalist groups such as the Kommandokorps have also criticised the organisation, alleging that the group is too moderate in their approach to problems facing South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Kommandokorps-denies-racism-20120227|title=Kommandokorps denies racism|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Chapter 9 institution]], the [[Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities]], launched an attack on AfriForum's campaign for the protection of [[Afrikaans]] medium schools in a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=24488&amp;tid=53893 |title=Redirecting old link |work=info.gov.za }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was presumed by AfriForum that the Commission deliberately acted in contravention of its mandate as set out in Section 185 of the Constitution, which led AfriForum to suspect that the Commission was functioning as an extension of the ruling party.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The [[African National Congress Youth League]] has stated that AfriForum is "the defender of white privilege"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/afriforum-defender-of-white-priviledge-ancyl-1.1313072|title=Afriforum ‘defender of white privilege’: ANCYL|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; while commentator and journalist [[Max du Preez]] has described AfriForum's position as "reactionary identity politics", and claimed that Afrikaners who criticised AfriForum are "aggressively demonised, insulted, belittled and even threatened".&lt;ref name="duPreezAfriForumDaProblem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/the-problem-afriforum-is-causing-the-da-20180515|title=The problem AfriForum is causing the DA|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice Chancellor of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] [[Adam Habib]] condemned AfriForum in May 2018 and said in an interview that the AfriForum was building ties with "[[proto-fascist]] groups" including the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]], the Italian [[Five Star Movement]], and Germany's [[Alternative for Germany|AFD]].&lt;ref name="iolKrielTryingToRevise"/&gt;

'''Allofeeding''' is a type of [[Evolutionary models of food sharing|food sharing]] [[Behavior|behaviour]] observed in [[Cooperative breeding|cooperatively breed]]ing species of [[bird]]s. Allofeeding refers to a parent, sibling or unrelated adult bird feeding [[altricial]] [[hatchling]]s, which are dependent on [[parental care]] for their survival.&lt;ref name="barrows"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yaXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE9ePx_sHRAhWLq1QKHUJ1CC8Q6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference|last=Barrows|first=Edward M.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-3652-1|edition=3rd|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding also refers to food sharing between adults of the same species.&lt;ref name="handicap"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ImjqhNqjiqsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-jfi2gMLRAhVIhlQKHVOQAHE4ChDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|last2=Zahavi|first2=Avishag|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-19-510035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, [[Courtship display|courtship]], egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan M.|date=1980|title=Demand Behavior: A New Interpretation of Courtship Feeding|jstor=1367395|journal=The Condor|volume=82|issue=3|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/1367395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=Matthew R.|last2=Holmes|first2=Aaron L.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Allofeeding evolved for different reasons in different species of birds. While Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows allofeed to reduce [[predation]] during incubation, Sichuan Jays allofeed to increase a female’s nutritional level prior to egg laying, and Chinstrap Penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jing|first=Yu|last2=Fang|first2=Yun|last3=Strickland|first3=Dan|last4=Lu|first4=Nan|last5=Sun|first5=Yue-Hua|date=2009|title=Alloparenting in the Rare Sichuan Jay (Perisoreus Internigrans) - Cuidado Aloparental en la Especie Rara Perisoreus internigrans|journal=The Condor|volume=111|issue=4|pages=662–667|doi=10.1525/cond.2009.080114|jstor=10.1525/cond.2009.080114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mori|first=Yoshihisa|last2=Kokubun|first2=Nobuo|last3=Shin|first3=Hyoung-Chul|last4=Takahashi|first4=Akinori|date=2010-10-01|title=An observation of between-mates feeding behaviour in chick-guarding chinstrap penguins|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|journal=Polar Biology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1437–1438|doi=10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well-being of the chicks. Arabian Bablers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the King Penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be  altruistic and highly revered. And the far more practical Barn Owl, of course, peer allofeeds merely to reduce sibling rivalry/competition during meal times.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlisle|first=Tamsie R.|last2=Zahavi|first2=Amotz|date=1986-04-01|title=Helping at the nest, allofeeding and social status in immature arabian babblers|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299665|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=339–351|doi=10.1007/BF00299665|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roulin|first=A.|last2=Monstiers|first2=B.

Although many species of birds exhibit allofeeding, there are some species that do not perform allofeeding, such as Siberian Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

== Allofeeding between mates ==
Many species of migratory [[songbird]]s display allofeeding during the [[incubation period]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; During the incubation period, a male songbird will feed its mate, while she sits on the eggs through beak-to-beak interaction.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is suggested to be adaptive because the male is indirectly investing in its offspring.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The male uses its energy to forage and retrieve food, and to feed the female.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This behaviour of the male reduces nutritional stress of the female because it reduces the amount of time the female spends foraging.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In addition, the allofeeding behaviour decreases the number of times a female has to leave the nest, which in turn extends the incubation period and reduces the risk of nest being detected by a predator.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Overall, allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased fitness and is therefore considered advantageous.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; However, Nolan (1958) theorizes that allofeeding is a non-adaptive and is derived from anticipatory parental care.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Allofeeding during the incubation period can also transpire through both the male and the female interchangeably feeding each other via beak-to-beak interactions, while a mate receiving the food incubates the eggs.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Once feeding is completed, the recipient now becomes the feeder and the mate that was just foraging incubates the eggs. For example, Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows (''Spizella breweri breweri'') allofeed in this manner.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; A recent study by Halley et al., 2015, examined allofeeding in twenty-four nests of Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study revealed that allofeeding occurred at low frequencies (55%) in nests with biparental incubation and no allofeeding occurred in uniparental nests.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study suggests that allofeeding is an intraspecific signal required to maintain social bonds between mates, in addition to increasing the nutrition levels of females and concealment of the nest.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Furthermore, the study found that incubation sessions per hour were higher in biparental nests with allofeeding than in biparental nests without allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; These findings indicate that allofeeding is beneficial because it reduces the risk of predation from visually oriented predators through increased nest concealment,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; which can maximize the fitness of males while increasing the fitness of females.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

There have been many documented observations of allofeeding between mates (mate allofeeding).&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; However, in penguins allofeeding between mates is rare.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; In 2010, [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguins]] (''P. antarctica'') allofeeding was reported during the period of chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The researchers witnessed a male feeding a female, which had a large chick in its nest.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The behaviour was engaged by the female frequently pecking the side of the male’s bill to stimulate the male to regurgitate its food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; This resulted in the male regurgitating its food into the female’s open mouth. This allofeeding behaviour was identical to the manner in which a chick begs its parent for food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Notably, during this behaviour the female kept the attention of male when the chick tried to gain the male’s attention.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; It is proposed that mate allofeeding in Chinstrap Penguins was performed to strengthen the bond between the pair.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

Allofeeding between mates can also occur during courtship.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding occurs in half of bird subfamilies and mainly appears in monogamous bird species.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs or increase a female’s nutritional level before laying eggs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; For example, in the Sichuan Jay ([[Sichuan jay|''P. internigrans'']]), females are fed by only one male during courtship.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is suggested that allofeeding the female during courtship, increases a female’s nutritional level before egg laying.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This behaviour was also recorded in the Grey Jays (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Other species of birds display allofeeding during courtship. Additionally, courtship allofeeding in some birds species is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

== Allofeeding and parental care ==

=== ''Aptenodytes patagonicus'' ===
[[File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|thumb|Emperor Penguin (''Aptenodytes patagonicus)'' feeding its offspring]]
A parent feeding a non-biological chick via bill-to-bill interactions is a form of allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lecomte|first=Nicolas|last2=Kuntz|first2=Gregoire|last3=Lambert|first3=Nicolas|last4=Gendner|first4=Jean-Paul|last5=Handrich|first5=Yves|last6=Maho|first6=Yvon Le|last7=Bost|first7=Charles-André|title=Alloparental feeding in the king penguin|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347205004173|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=71|issue=2|pages=457–462|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouventin|first=Pierre|last2=Barbraud|first2=Christophe|last3=Rubin|first3=Michel|title=Adoption in the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1023–1029|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental allofeeding occurs in all altricial species of birds to ensure proper growth, development, and to prevent starvation of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Sönke|last2=Griesser|first2=Michael|last3=Ekman|first3=Jan|date=2005-01-01|title=Predator-induced plasticity in nest visitation rates in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus)|url=http://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/16/1/309/206728/Predatorinduced-plasticity-in-nest-visitation|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=309–315|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh163|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of allofeeding has been shown to be a form of parental care in some species, such as in King Penguins ([[King penguin|''A. patagonicus'']]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguins are pelagic seabirds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguin chicks form dense groups called crèches during winter for social thermoregulation when food availability is low.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The formation of crèches results from the parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks to gather food from the sea.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A study by Lecomte et al., 2015 examined the allofeeding behaviour in King Penguins, in which they marked the white underbellies of 74 non-breeding adults and 103 breeding pairs with a unique dark colouring called dye-mark code of Nyanzol-D.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) found 22% of the marked adults feed 65% of the chicks in crèches, revealing that allofeeding behaviour was most common during the breeding season.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) also identified that most of the 22% of adult King Penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour were unable to successfully breed along with few breeders performing the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The allofeeding behaviour resulted in more feedings for chicks,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which is consistent with study by Pierre et al. (1994) that showed that allofeeding in penguins increases the chick growth rate from 35g/day to 190g/day.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; From these results, Lecomte et al., (2015) concluded that allofeeding increased the survival rate of chicks in crèches.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The results imply that parental allofeeding in King Penguins is an altruistic behaviour, where allofeeding benefits the young at a cost to the non-biological parent.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Notably, no direct benefits to the non-biological parents have been described.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The cost of allofeeding non-biological chicks resulted in no detrimental effects to the fitness of the [[Alloparenting|alloparent]], because the cost of allofeeding is low (several grams) when compared to the nutritional costs of an adult king penguin, which is several kilograms.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, it is suggested that allofeeding many chicks may cost each chick lost meals that can cause negative effects on the fitness of allofed chicks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, allofeeding decreases when non-biological parents had offspring.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas antarctica'' ===
The [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguin]] (''P. antarctica'') is another species of penguin that displays allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Allofeeding in the Chinstrap Penguin has been observed between the female and its offspring.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Similar to mate allofeeding in this species, the offspring of a female will peck the side of the female’s bill to signal the female to regurgitate its food into the chick's open mouth.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

=== ''Perisoreus internigrans'' ===
In Sichuan Jays ([[Sichuan jay|''P. Internigrans'']]), females are not the only sex that participates in the allofeeding of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; During their first week of life, the chicks are only fed by the male.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/studies-of-less-familiar-birds-162-siberian-jay/|title=Studies of less Familiar birds 162 Siberian Jay - British Birds|last=Blomgren|first=Arne Blomgren|date=|work=British Birds|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male forages and stores food in a pouch within its throat. At the nest, the male regurgitates the semi-digested food from its pouch into the mouths of its chicks.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; After the first week, the male continues to feed the chicks while the female begins feeding the chicks.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The female uses the same method as the male.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

== Peer allofeeding ==

=== ''Turdoides sqamiceps'' ===
There have been many reported cases of allofeeding between siblings in several species of birds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; For example, the Arabian Babblers ([[Arabian babbler|''T. sqamiceps'']]) are a territorial, desert inhibiting species of bird that participate in cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In this species, non-breeders show numerous types of cooperative behaviour, including allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Adult and immature Babblers, as well as previous and newly fledged Babblers, will frequently engage in allofeeding behaviour.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Carlisle et al. (1986) revealed that Arabian Babblers participate in peer allofeeding in order to increase social rank, which increases fitness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is supported by the Zahavi's hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; An individual (a dominate Babbler) can increase in social rank by allofed a subordinate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the contrary, an individual (a subordinate Babbler) can decrease in social rank when they are allofed by a dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Subordinate Babblers have been observed refusing to be allofeed by dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The refusal resulted in the dominate Babbler becoming aggressive with the subordinate - hitting or chasing the subordinate.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Dominate Babblers also showed the same aggressive behaviours when a subordinate tried to allofeed it.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== ''Tyto alba'' ===
Another species that exhibits peer allofeeding is the [[Barn owl|Barn Owl]] (''T. alba'').&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Barn Owl nest siblings establish a hierarchy for the sharing of food resources via vocal negotiations.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; It is suggested that Barn Owl nest siblings show peer allofeeding to reduce sibling competition in the food sharing hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Peer allofeeding observed in 60 nestling pairs revealed that the behaviour occurs by a donor sibling placing the food item on the ground in front of the receiver sibling, which transfers the food item to its bill using its talons.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Alternatively, the donor sibling uses its bill to place the food item in the bill of the receiver sibling.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; As well, peer allofeeding behaviour in Barn Owl siblings is proposed to increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of the peer performing the allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

== Intraspecific allofeeding ==

=== ''Perisoreus Internigrans'' ===
[[File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|thumb|Gray Jays (''Perisoreus canadensis)'' feeding offspring at the nest]]
Intraspecific allofeeding in Sichuan Jays (''[[Sichuan jay|P. internigrans]]'') is performed during the nestling and fledging period by non-breeders.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; One to three non-breeders support a nesting breeding pair by feeding the chicks, regurgitating the food from their throat pouches.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; In 2009, Jing et al. determined that two non-breeders contributed to 44% of feedings in the nest of two Sichuan Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Jing et al. (2009) suggest that allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased nest survival.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

In Sichuan Jays, allofeeding is hypothesized to be evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In this species, two to three non-breeders will allofeed the young of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The large body mass (21% heavier than Siberian Jays) of the Sichuan Jays, and the presence of more than one non-breeder, allows one non-breeder to ward off a predator while another non-breeder protects the young from additional predators.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Both the large body mass of the non-breeders and the presence of multiple non-breeders reduces the risk of injury or death when predators are encountered.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefits of allofeeding the young outweighs the cost of injury or death of the non-breeder and/or chick when more than one non-breeder is present.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Peer allofeeding has also been observed in the Gray Jay (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Gray Jay, non-breeders allofeed the young after fledging.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

Not all species of jays allofeed their young, such as the Siberian Jay (''[[Siberian jay|P. infaustus]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Siberian Jays, non-breeders do not allofeed the chicks of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is predicted that Siberian Jays do not display allofeeding because the cost of predation is too high.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Siberian Jays are continuously threatened by a more dangerous predators, the Eurasian Sparrowhawk and Northern Goshawk, then Gray Jays, which are threatened by Eurasian red squirrel.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  One non-breeder per breeding pair and the small size (21% less body mass than the Sichuan Jays) of the Siberian Jays, in combination with continuous risk of predation, reveals that the non-breeding Siberian Jays are unable to confront predators and protect the nest simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This indicates that the cost of allofeeding the young is more costly to the non-breeder when one non-breeder is present because an encounter with a predator increases the risk of injury and death of both the young and the non-breeder.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefit of allofeeding the young does not exceed the cost of injury or death of non-breeder and/or young.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This is consistent with the predator-avoidance hypothesis, suggesting that the cost of allofeeding in the Siberian Jays prevents allofeeding from being evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">A [[bounded sequence|bounded]] [[real number|real]] [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''almost convergent'' to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if each [[Banach limit]] assigns
the same value &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to the sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Lorentz proved that &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is almost convergent if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{p\to\infty} \frac{x_{n}+\ldots+x_{n+p-1}}p=L&lt;/math&gt;
uniformly in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The above limit can be rewritten in detail as
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \varepsilon&gt;0 : \exists p_0 : \forall p&gt;p_0 : \forall n : \left|\frac{x_{n}+\ldots+x_{n+p-1}}p-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Almost convergence is studied in [[summability theory]]. It is an example of a summability method
which cannot be represented as a matrix method.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy,p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanskrit word "'''bhava'''" (भव) means "being, worldly existence, becoming, birth, be, production, origin,"&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Archive: [http://andhrabharati.com/dictionary/sanskrit/index.php भव], bhava&lt;/ref&gt; but also "habitual or emotional tendencies."&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], ''bhava'' is the tenth of the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links]] of ''[[Pratītyasamutpāda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julius Evola |author2=H. E.

== In Buddhism ==
In [[Buddhism]], ''bhava'' (not ''bhāva'') means "being, worldly existence, becoming, birth, be, production, origin"&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; "experience,"&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p499"/&gt; in the sense of rebirths and redeaths, because a being is so conditioned and propelled by the karmic accumulations;&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p499"/&gt; but also "habitual or emotional tendencies."&lt;ref name="BV"&gt;[http://library.dhammasukha.org/what-is-habitual-tendencies.html What is Habitual Tendencies?] by  [[Bhante Vimalaramsi]] and [[Sister Khanti-Khema]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''bhāva'' (भाव) is rooted in the term ''bhava'' (भव), and also has a double meaning, as "emotion, sentiment, state of body or mind, disposition and character",&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=bhAva&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 भव], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and in some context also means "becoming, being, existing, occurring, appearance" while connoting the condition thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Archive: [http://andhrabharati.com/dictionary/sanskrit/index.php भाव], bhAva&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bhava'' is the tenth of the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links]] of [[pratitya-samutpada|pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination), which describes [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]], the repeated cycle of our habitual repsonses to sensory impressions which leads to renewed ''[[Jati (Buddhism)|jāti]]'', birth. Birth is usually interpeted as rebirth in one of the realms of existence, namely heaven, demi-god, human, animal, hungry ghost or hell realms (''[[bhavacakra]]'') of Buddhist cosmology.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p499"/&gt; In Thai Buddhism, ''bhava'' is also interpreted as the habitual or emotional tendencies which leads to the arising of the sense of self, as a mental phenomenon.

In the [[Jatakas|Jātakas]], in which the [[Gautama Siddartha|Buddha]] didactically reminds various followers of experiences they shared with him in a past life, the hearers are said not to remember them due to ''bhava'', i.e. to having been reborn.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline A.F. Rhys Davids, ''Stories of the Buddha (Being Selections from the Jātakas)'', 1989, Dover Publications, ''Introduction'', pp. xix, also see pp. 2,6,11,etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
Bhava appears in the sense of "becoming, being, existing, occurring, appearance"  in the Vedanga literature Srauta Sutras, the Upanishads such as the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], the [[Mahabharata]] and other ancient Hindu texts.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Archive: [http://andhrabharati.com/dictionary/sanskrit/index.php भाव], bhAva&lt;/ref&gt;

===In [[Ramakrishna Mission]] ===
According to Swami Sivananda, there are three kinds of bhava – sattvic, rajasic and tamasic. Which predominates in a person depends on their own nature, but sattvic bhava is "Divine bhava" or pure bhava (Suddha bhava).{{cn|date=May 2016}} Swami Nikhilananda classifies bhava as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Swami Nikhilananda ''Vivekananda: The Yogas and Other Works'' Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, 1984 [1953] {{ISBN|0-911206-04-3}} pp. 450-453.&lt;/ref&gt;

Backwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to "come from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The notion of objects or information which are "self-existing" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical,&lt;ref name="Lobo" /&gt; with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a  ''bootstrap paradox'',&lt;ref name="Everett"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Everett|first1=Allen|last2=Roman|first2=Thomas|title=Time Travel and Warp Drives|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-22498-5|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dm5xt_XbFyoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA136 136–139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Lorentzian Wormholes: From Einstein to Hawking|date=1996|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=1-56396-653-0|p=213}} "A second class of logical paradoxes associated with time travel are the bootstrap paradoxes related to information (or objects, or even people?) being created from nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomey2012"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Toomey|first=David|title=The New Time Travelers|date=2012|publisher=W.

An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; A similar example is given in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Holmes|first=Jonathan|work=Radio Times|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox|title=Doctor Who: what is the Bootstrap Paradox?|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett gives the movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.&lt;ref name="Everett" /&gt;

Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001"&gt;{{cite|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys.

A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] labeled such items without origin as ''Jinn'', with the singular term ''Jinnee''.&lt;ref name="Lossev1992"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

The term ''predestination paradox'' is used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise to mean "a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-4623-2|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6bvoGUg7G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as [[Calvinism]] and some forms of [[Marxism]] which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Daniels|first=Robert V.|date=May–June 1960|title=Soviet Power and Marxist Determinism|journal=Problems of Communism|volume=9|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059418874;view=1up;seq=159 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term "predestination paradox" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.&lt;ref name="smeenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstern"&gt;{{cite|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |last=Morgenstern|first=Leora|year=2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-fulfilling prophecy==
A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 37–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Popper|first1=Karl|title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography|date=1985|publisher=Open Court|location=La Salle, Ill.|isbn=978-0-87548-343-6|edition=Rev.|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman" /&gt;

''Evolution of the Universe'', p. 169: "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="Friedman1990" /&gt; the authors suggested the ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as "Polchinski's paradox".&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt; Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Echeverria|1991}}| first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|184}} The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188" /&gt;{{Rp|187–188}}

Novikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Nahin | first =Paul J. | title = Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction | publisher =American Institute of Physics |year= 1999 | isbn = 0-387-98571-9|pp=345–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001" /&gt;{{Rp|14–16}}

==Quantum computation with negative delay==
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;could solve NP problems in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Deutsch | url= http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | title= Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | year=1991 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | pages=3197–3217 | bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Aaronson]] later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve [[PSPACE]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2008|title=The Limits of Quantum Computers|pages=68–69|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/limitsqc-draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Scott | last=Aaronson |author2=John Watrous | url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/ctc.pdf | title=Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume = 465 | year=2009 | issue = 2102 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0350 | pages=631–647 | bibcode=2009RSPSA.465..631A|arxiv = 0808.2669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991" /&gt; Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name=RingbauerEtAl2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin Ringbauer|author2=Matthew A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4492">{{planes of existence}}
'''Causal plane''' is a term used in [[Neo-Theosophy]], some contemporary [[Vedanta]], the [[New Age]], (especially some [[Mediumship|channelled]] communications), and sometimes [[Occultism]], to describe a high spiritual [[Plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]], i.e. ([[hyperplane]], which even the physical is). However there is great variation between the different definitions.

==Neo-theosophy==
The Neo-theosophy of [[Annie Besant]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]] replaced [[Blavatsky]]'s "Higher Manas" [[Septenary (Theosophy)|principle]] with the "Higher Mental", "Abstract Mind" (as opposed to Lower Mental or "Concrete Mind"), or Causal Body. The equivalent cosmic plane is the Causal Plane. A detailed description of the Causal Plane, along with the Causal Body, is provided by A. E. Powell, who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

The Neo-theosphical concept of Causal Plane proved very influential both in India (via the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar branch of Theosophy]]) and in the [[New Age]], via [[Alice Bailey]].

==Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami==
[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] incorporates Theosophical ideas into the traditional Hindu Vedic [[cosmology]], when he describes three worlds of existence ([[trailokya|triloka]]) as ''Bhuloka'' or [[physical plane]], ''Antarloka'' or the [[subtle realm|subtle]] or [[astral plane]], and ''Sivaloka'' ("World of Siva") or the causal plane or Karanaloka, the world of the [[deity|Gods]] and highly developed [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s. About this latter he says

&lt;blockquote&gt;The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and His entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form—radiant bodies of [[centillion]]s of [[Quantum|quantum light particles]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further says that this region, present as the clear white light that illumines the mind, can be accessed through the three higher [[chakras]], the [[vishuddha]], [[ajna]] and [[sahasrara]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/dws_mandala-09.html Dancing With Siva]'', pp.125-131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astral travel==
Although Neo-theosophy presents the sequence Physical-Astral-Mental-Causal, in the jargon of some [[astral projection|astral travelling]] teachings, the causal plane is the one just above the astral plane. According to the Astral Voyage website (see [http://www.astralvoyage.com/projection/Glossary.html glossary]) this is the region where [[Akashic Records|memories and karmic patterns]] are stored, and where a practitioner can access information regarding the past and future.

==Michael cosmology==
The complex metaphysics of the Channelled entity Michael includes a description of the universe in terms of seven planes. These are the Physical plane, the Astral plane, the Causal plane, the Akashic plane, the Mental plane, the Messianic plane, and the Buddhaic plane. Here the Causal plane is the third plane of creation, and its medium is concrete intellectual energy. In [[The Michael Teachings]], this is Michael's plane of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd Hoodwin, ''The 7 Planes of Existence,''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39776">'''Child discipline''' is the methods used to prevent future behavioral problems in children. The word discipline is defined as imparting knowledge and skill, in other words, to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Canadian Paediatric Society |title= Effective discipline for children |journal= Paediatrics &amp; Child Health |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 37–41 |pmc= 2719514|year= 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its most general sense, [[discipline]] refers to systematic instruction given to a disciple. ''To discipline'' means to instruct a person to follow a particular code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Papalia|first=D.E. |last2=Wendkos-Olds |first2=S. |last3= Duskin-Feldman |first3=R. |year=2006 |title=A Child's World: Infancy Through Adolescence |edition=10th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discipline is used by parents to teach their children about expectations, guidelines and principles. Children need to be given regular discipline to be taught right from wrong and to be maintained safe. Child discipline can involve rewards and punishments to teach self-control, increase desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smenyak |first=Sarah |title=The difference between discipline and child abuse |url= http://www.livestrong.com/article/69111-difference-between-discipline-child/ |publisher=Demand Media |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the purpose of child discipline is to develop and entrench desirable social [[Habituation|habits]] in children, the ultimate goal is to foster sound judgement and [[morality|morals]] so the child develops and maintains self-discipline throughout the rest of his/her life.

Because the values, beliefs, education, customs and [[culture]]s of people vary so widely, along with the age and temperament of the child, methods of child discipline vary widely.  Child discipline is a topic that draws from a wide range of interested fields, such as [[parenting]], the professional practice of [[behavior analysis]], [[developmental psychology]], [[social work]], and various [[religion|religious perspectives]].  In recent years, advances in the understanding of [[attachment parenting]] have provided a new background of theoretical understanding and advanced clinical and practical understanding of the effectiveness and outcome of parenting methods.

In Western society, there has been debate in recent years over the use of [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] for [[child]]ren in general, and increased attention to the concept of "positive parenting" where good behavior is encouraged and rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/HelpAndAdvice/Publications/Leaflets/encouraging_pdf_wdf36202.pdf |title=Encouraging better behavior - A practical guide to positive parenting |publisher=[[NSPCC]] |year=2003 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014154404/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/helpandadvice/publications/leaflets/encouraging_pdf_wdf36202.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency, firmness and respect are all important components of [[positive discipline]]. The goal of positive discipline is to teach, train and guide children so that they learn, practice self-control and develop the ability to manage their emotions, and make wise choices regarding their personal behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/positive_discipline_punishment_vs_discipline|title=Positive discipline: Punishment vs. discipline|work=MSU Extension|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical research suggests that there has been a great deal of individual variation in methods of discipline over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollock |first=Linda A. |title= Forgotten children: parent-child relations from 1500 to 1900 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JYR4nxXWIjMC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=18th+century+child+discipline&amp;q=18th%20century%20child%20discipline |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-25009-9 |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
Nicholas Orme of the University of Exeter argues that children in medieval times were treated differently from adults in legal matters, and the authorities were as troubled about violence to children as they were to adults. In his article, "Childhood in Medieval England," he states, "Corporal punishment was in use throughout society and probably also in homes, although social commentators criticized parents for indulgence towards children rather than for harsh discipline." Salvation was the main goal of discipline, and parents were driven to ensure their children a place in heaven.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Sandy |title=How has child discipline changed?|url= http://www.livestrong.com/article/31506-child-discipline-changed/ |publisher=Demand Media |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident in early 14th-century London, neighbors intervened when a cook and clerk were beating a boy carrying water. A scuffle ensued and the child's tormentors were subdued. The neighbors didn't even know the boy, but they firmly stood up for him even when they were physically attacked, and they stood by their actions when the cook and clerk later sued for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara, ''Growing Up in Medieval London'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial times===
During colonial times in the United States, parents were able to provide enjoyments for their children in the form of toys, according to David Robinson, writer for the ''Colonial Williamsburg Journal''. Robinson notes that even the Puritans permitted their young children to play freely. Older children were expected to swiftly adopt adult chores and accountabilities, to meet the strict necessities of daily life.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;  Harsh punishments for minor infractions were common. Beatings and other forms of corporal punishment occurred regularly; one legislator even suggested capital punishment for children's misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED252451|title=ERIC - Student Discipline in Colonial America., 1984-Nov|work=ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical views ===
The [[Book of Proverbs]] mentions the importance of disciplining children, as opposed to leaving them neglected or unruly, in several verses. Interpretation of these verses varies, as do many passages from the Bible, from literal to metaphorical. The most often paraphrased is from Proverbs 13:24, "He that spareth his [[switch (rod)|rod]] hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes." ([[King James Version]].) Other passages that mention the 'rod' are Proverbs 23:14, "Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell," and Proverbs 29:15, "The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.learnthebible.org/eight-misconceptions-about-spanking.html |title= Eight Misconceptions About Spanking  |publisher=Learn The Bible |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Bible's lessons have been paraphrased for hundreds of years, the modern phrase, "Spare the rod and spoil the child," was coined by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], in ''[[Hudibras]]'', a [[mock heroic]] [[narrative poem]] published in 1663. The [[Contemporary English Version]] of Proverbs 13:24 is: 'If you love your children you will correct them; if you don't love them, you won't correct them'.

=== Medieval views ===
[[Image:Koerperstrafe- MA Birkenrute.png|thumb|280px|Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks]]
The primary guidelines followed by medieval parents in training their children were from the Bible. Scolding was considered ineffectual, and cursing a child was a terrible thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanawalt |first=Barbara |title= The Ties that Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the use of corporal punishment was as a disciplinary action taken to shape behavior, not a pervasive dispensing of beatings for no reason. Corporal punishment was undoubtedly the norm.  The medieval world was a dangerous place, and it could take harsh measures to prepare a child to live in it. Pain was the medieval way of illustrating that actions had consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historymedren.about.com/od/medievalchildren/a/child_play_3.htm |title=The Medieval Child, Part 4: The Playful Years |publisher=About.com |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of John Locke ===
In his 1690 ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' English [[physician]] and [[philosopher]]  [[John Locke]] argued that the child resembled a blank tablet ([[tabula rasa]]) at birth, and was not inherently full of [[sin]]. In his 1693 ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' he suggested that the task of the parent was to build in the child the strong body and [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] of mind that would allow the capacity of [[reason]] to develop, and that [[parents]] could reward good behavior with their esteem and punish bad behavior with disgrace – the withdrawal of parental approval and affection - as opposed to beatings.&lt;ref name="FAQs.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Co-Fa/Discipline.html |title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society - Discipline  |publisher=FAQs.org |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The twentieth century ===
In the early twentieth century, child-rearing experts abandoned a romantic view of childhood and advocated formation of proper habits to discipline children. A 1914 U.S. Children's Bureau pamphlet, ''Infant Care'', urged a strict schedule and admonished parents not to play with their babies.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[John B. Watson]]'s 1924 ''Behaviorism'' argued that parents could train malleable children by rewarding good behavior and punishing bad, and by following precise schedules for food, sleep, and other bodily functions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Although such principles began to be rejected as early as the 1930s, they were firmly renounced in the 1946 best-seller ''[[The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]]'', by pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]], which told parents to trust their own instincts and to view the child as a reasonable, friendly human being. Dr. Spock revised his first edition to urge more parent-centered discipline in 1957, but critics blamed his popular book for its permissive attitude during the youth rebellions of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="FAQs.org"/&gt;

=== Conservative backlash ===

Following the permissive trend of the 1960s and early 1970s, American [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] [[James Dobson]] sought the return of a more conservative society and advocated [[spanking]] of children up to age eight.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobson |first=James |title=Dare to Discipline |year=1977 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0-553-22841-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson's position is controversial. As early as 1985 ''The New York Times'' stated that "most child-care experts today disapprove of physical punishment."&lt;ref name=nyt85&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Wright |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 June 1985 |page=C9 |title= Parents and Experts Split on Spanking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, parents have historically had the right to spank their children when appropriate. A 2006 retrospective study in New Zealand, showed that physical punishment of children remained quite common in the 1970s and 1980s, with 80% of the sample reporting some kind of corporal punishment from parents, at some time during childhood. Among this sample, 29% reported being hit with an empty hand. However 45% were hit with an object, and 6% were subjected to serious physical abuse.  The study noted that abusive physical punishment tended to be given by fathers and often involved striking the child's head or torso instead of the buttocks or limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millichamp |first=Jane |author2=Martin, J. |author3=Langley, J. |year=2006 |title=On the receiving end: young adults describe their parents' use of physical punishment and other disciplinary measures during childhood |journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal |volume=119 |issue=1228 |pmid=16462926 |pages= U1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes have changed in recent years, and legislation in some countries, particularly in continental Europe, reflect an increased skepticism toward corporal punishment.  As of December 2017, domestic corporal punishment has been outlawed in 56 countries around the world, most of them in Europe and Latin America, beginning with Sweden in 1966. Official figures show that just 10 percent of Swedish children had been spanked or otherwise struck by their parents by 2010, compared to more than 90 percent in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=swed30&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1005/p06s10-woeu.html |last= Sullivan |first= Tom |location= Boston |title=In 30 years without spanking, are Swedish children better behaved? |newspaper =The Christian Science Monitor |date=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish law does not actually lay down any legal punishment for smacking but requires social workers to support families with problems.&lt;ref name=swed30/&gt;

Even as corporal punishment became increasingly controversial in North America, Britain, Australia and much of the rest of the English-speaking world, limited corporal punishment of children by their parents remained lawful in all 50 states of the [[United States]]. It was not until 2012 that [[Delaware]] became the first state to pass a statute defining "physical injury" to a child to include "any impairment of physical condition or pain."&lt;ref&gt;:DELAWARE STATE SENATE 146th GENERAL ASSEMBLY, SENATE BILL NO. 234, AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 11 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO OFFENSES AGAINST CHILDREN.

::Amending Chapter 5, Title 11 of the Delaware Code by redesignating Section 1100 of Chapter 5, Title 11 as Section 1100A of Chapter 5, Title 11 and further by redesignating current Section 1103 of Chapter 5, Title 11 as Section 1100, of Chapter 5, Title 11, and by further amending the current language of that section ...

This act amends Chapter 5 §1100 to provide as follows:

:Definitions relating to children:

:When used in this subchapter:

...

::(j) "Physical injury" to a child shall mean any impairment of physical condition or pain.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural differences ==
A number of authors have emphasized the importance of cultural differences in assessing disciplinary methods. Baumrind argues that "The cultural context critically determines the meaning and therefore the consequences of physical discipline . . ." (Baumrind, 1996; italics in original). Polite (1996) emphasizes that the "debate over whether or not to use corporal punishment rages in many ethnic communities." Larzelare, Baumrind and Polite assert that "After ignoring decades of cultural differences in the effects of spanking, these 2 ARCHIVES [1997] studies and 2 other studies in the past year have each found significantly
different effects for African Americans than for non-Hispanic European Americans. The effects of spanking in African American families are generally beneficial to children, unless it is used excessively, either in severity or in frequency." (Larzelere et al., 1998; references to other articles omitted). Our results confirm the serious differences of opinion on discipline, even in a relatively homogenous ethnic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Amuwo |first=Shaffdeen |author2=Robert Fabian |author3=Jacqueline Hill |author4=Ardith Spence |author5=George Tolley  |journal= Journal of Socio-Economics |year=2004 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=153–173 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535703001185 |accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2003.12.016 |title=Child discipline and family decision-making}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting styles==
There are different [[parenting styles]] which parents use to discipline their children. Four types have been identified: authoritative parents, authoritarian parents, indulgent parents, and indifferent parents.

'''''Authoritative parents''''' are parents who use warmth, firm control, and rational, issue-oriented discipline, in which emphasis is placed on the development of self-direction. They place a high value on the development of autonomy and self-direction, but assume the ultimate responsibility for their child's behavior. "You live under my roof, you follow my rules!" is a cliché, but one that parents may often find themselves speaking - and it probably most closely mimics the authoritative parenting style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parentingliteracy.com/parenting-a-z/44-overview/47-parenting-styles/|title=Parenting Styles|work=parentingliteracy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Authoritarian parents''''' are parents who use punitive, absolute, and forceful discipline, and who place a premium on obedience and conformity. If parents exhibit good emotional understanding and control, children also learn to manage their own emotions and learn to understand others as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|date=February 1967|title=Child care practices anteceding three patterns of preschool behavior|journal=Genetic Psychology Monographs|volume=75|issue=1|pages=43–88|issn=0016-6677|pmid=6032134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents believe it is their responsibility to provide for their children and that their children have no right to tell the parent how best to do this. Adults are expected to know from experience what is really in the child's best interest and so adult views are allowed to take precedence over child desires. Children are perceived to know what they want but not necessarily what is best for them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Parenting Styles. Written by Joseph Lao, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indulgent parents '''''are parents who are characterized by responsiveness but low demandingness, and who are mainly concerned with the child's happiness. They behave in an accepting, benign, and somewhat more passive way in matters of discipline.

'''''Indifferent parents''''' are parents who are characterized by low levels of both responsiveness and demandingness. They try to do whatever is necessary to minimize the time and energy they must devote to interacting with their child. In extreme cases, indifferent parents may be neglectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steingberg |first= Laurence |title=Adolescence |year=2011 |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353203-5 |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ask very little of their children. For instance, they rarely assign their children chores. They tend to be relatively uninvolved in their children's lives. It's not that they don't love their children. It's just that they believe their children should live their own lives, as free of parental control as possible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

A fifth type of parenting style is connectedness. '''Connected parents''' are parents who want to improve the way in which they connect with their children using an empathetic approach to challenging or even tumultuous relationships. Using the 'CALM' technique, by Jennifer Kolari, parents recognize the importance of empathy and aspire to build capacity in their children in hopes of them becoming confident and emotionally resilient. The CALM acronym stands for: '''C'''onnect emotionally, match the '''A'''ffect of the child, '''L'''isten to what your child is saying and '''M'''irror their emotion back to show understanding.&lt;ref&gt;last=Kolari |first=Jennifer |title= Connected Parenting|year=2009|publisher=Viking Canada|location=Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-physical discipline==
Non-physical discipline consists of both punitive and non-punitive methods but does not include any forms of corporal punishment such as hitting or spanking. The regular use of any single form of discipline becomes less effective when used too often, a process [[psychology|psychologists]] call [[habituation]]. Thus, no single method is considered to be for exclusive use. Non-Physical discipline is used in the concerted cultivation style of parenting that comes from the middle and upper class. concerted cultivation is the method of parenting that includes heavy parental involvement, and use reasoning and bargaining as disciplinary methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |title=Unequal Childhoods |year=2011 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27142-5 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time-outs ===
{{Main|Child time-out}}
A common method of child discipline is sending the child away from the family or group after misbehavior. Children may be told to stand in the corner ("corner time") or may be sent to their rooms for a period of time.
A [[child time-out|time-out]] involves isolating or separating a child for a few minutes and is intended to give an over-excited child time to calm down.
[[Image:Skamvrån av Carl Larsson 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Time-out'', painting by [[Carl Larsson]]]]
Alternatively, time-outs have been recommended{{By whom|date=June 2011}} as a time for parents to separate feelings of anger toward the child for their behavior and to develop a plan for discipline.

When using time-outs as a discipline strategy, individuals must also take into consideration the temperaments of the child if one decides to use time-outs. If a child, for example, has a feisty temperament, or a temperament that expresses emotion in a highly intense way, then discipline strategies of using time-outs would be ineffective because of the clash of discipline strategy to the child's temperament trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marion |first=Marian |title=Guidance of Young Children |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-154530-2 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an individual decides to use the time-out with a child as a discipline strategy, the individual must be unemotional and consistent with the undesired behavior. Along with taking into consideration the child's temperament, the length of the time-out needs to also depend on the age of the child. For example, the time-out should last one minute per year of the child's age, so if the child is five years old, the time-out should go no longer than five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effective discipline for children |journal=Paediatrics &amp; Child Health |date=January 2004 |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=37–41 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719514/pdf/pch09037.pdf |accessdate=30 November 2012 |pmc=2719514 |pmid=19654979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experts do not recommend the use of time-out or any other form of [[punishment]]. These authors include [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Alfie Kohn]], and [[Aletha Solter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2000). Parent Effectiveness Training: The Proven Program for Raising Responsible Children. New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2005). Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason. New York, NY: Atria Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1989). Helping Young Children Flourish. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press, and Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2002). The disadvantages of time-out. http://www.awareparenting.com/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grounding ===
{{Main|Grounding (discipline technique)}}
Grounding is a form of discipline, usually, for older children, preteens and teenagers, that restricts their movement outside of the home, such as visiting friends or using the car and they are not allowed to go anywhere but school and few required places. Sometimes it is combined with the withdrawal of privileges for computer, video games, telephone or TV.

=== Scolding ===
Scolding involves reproving or criticizing a child's negative behavior and/or actions.

Some research suggests that scolding is counter-productive because parental attention (including negative attention) tends to reinforce behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Johnson, Sylvia |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/10-tips-parents-defiant-children/story?id=8549664 |title= 10 Tips for Parents of Defiant Children |date= 15 September 2009 |work=ABC News |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-punitive discipline ==
While punishments may be of limited value in consistently influencing rule-related behavior, non-punitive discipline techniques have been found to have greater impact on children who have begun to master their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toner |first1=Ignatius J. |last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Punitive and non-punitive discipline and subsequent rule-following in young children |journal=Child and Youth Care Forum |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–37 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r00u746076w16067/ |doi=10.1007/BF01118991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-punitive discipline (also known as empathic discipline and positive discipline) is an approach to child-rearing that does not use any form of punishment. It is about loving guidance, and requires parents to have a strong relationship with their child so that the child responds to gentle guidance as opposed to threats and punishment. According to Dr. Laura Markham, the most effective discipline strategy is to make sure your child wants to please you.&lt;ref name=ahaparent&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools/positive-discipline/use-positive-discipline |title= How to Use Positive Discipline |author=Markham, Dr. Laura |publisher=Aha! Parenting |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-punitive discipline also excludes systems of "manipulative" rewards. Instead, a child's behavior is shaped by "democratic interaction" and by deepening parent-child communication. The reasoning behind it is that while punitive measures may stop the problem behavior in the short term, by themselves they do not provide a learning opportunity that allows children the autonomy to change their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.insideout-counselling.com.au/html/cms/12/non-punitive-discipline |title= Non-punitive discipline |publisher= Inside Out Counselling |accessdate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments such as time-outs may be seen as banishment and humiliation. Consequences as a form of punishment are not recommended, but natural consequences are considered to be possibly worthwhile learning experiences provided there is no risk of lasting harm.&lt;ref name=ahaparent /&gt;

Positive discipline is both non-violent discipline and non-punitive discipline. Criticizing, discouraging, creating obstacles and barriers, blaming, shaming, using sarcastic or cruel humor, or using physical punishment are some negative disciplinary methods used with young children. Any parent may occasionally do any of these things, but doing them more than once in a while may lead to low self-esteem becoming a permanent part of the child's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/Issues/discipline.html |title=Positive discipline |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=AtHealth.com |accessdate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essential aspects ===
In the past, harsh discipline has been the norm for families in society. However, research by psychologists has brought about new forms of effective discipline. Positive discipline is based on minimizing the child's frustrations and misbehavior rather than giving punishments. The main focus in this method is the "Golden Rule", treat others the way you want to be treated. Parents follow this when disciplining their children because they believe that their point will reach the children more effectively rather than traditional discipline. The foundation of this style of discipline is encouraging children to feel good about themselves and building the parent's relationship with the child so the child wants to please the parent. In traditional discipline, parents would instill fear in their child by using shame and humiliation to get their point across. However, studies show that this type of punishment ultimately causes the children to have more psychological problems in their adolescence and adulthood. Physical and harsh punishment shows the child that violence and negative treatment is acceptable in some circumstances, wheres, positive discipline demonstrates the opposite. In positive discipline the parents avoid negative treatment and focus on the importance of communication and showing unconditional love. Feeling loved, important and well liked has positive and negative effects on how a child perceives themselves. The child will feel important if the child feels well liked and loved by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No More Perfect Kids:Love Your Kids for Who They Are|last = Savage|first = Jill|publisher = Moody PubLishers|year = 2014|isbn = 9780802411525|location = |pages = |last2 = Koch|first2 = Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important aspects are reasonable and age-appropriate expectations, feeding healthy foods and providing enough rest, giving clear instructions which may need to be repeated, looking for the causes of any misbehavior and making adjustments, and building routines. Children are helped by knowing what is happening in their lives. Having some predictability about their day without necessarily being regimental will help reduce frustration and misbehavior.&lt;ref name=pchsa&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetails.aspx?p=114&amp;np=141&amp;id=2309 |title= The Nanny Show and you |publisher=Parenting and Child Health Services South Australia |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are the children taught to be open-minded, but the parents must demonstrate this as well.

=== Methods ===

==== Praise and rewards ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
Simply giving the child spontaneous expressions of appreciation or acknowledgement when they are not misbehaving will act as a reinforcer for good behavior. Focusing on good behavior versus bad behavior will encourage appropriate behavior in the given situation. According to B. F. Skinner, past behavior that is reinforced with praise is likely to repeat in the same or similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In operant conditioning, schedules of reinforcement are an important component of the learning process. When and how often we reinforce a behavior can have a dramatic impact on the strength and rate of the response.
A schedule of reinforcement is basically a rule stating which instances of a behavior will be reinforced. In some case, a behavior might be reinforced every time it occurs. Sometimes, a behavior might not be reinforced at all. Either positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement might be used, depending on the situation. In both cases, the goal of reinforcement is always to strengthen the behavior and increase the likelihood that it will occur again in the future.
In real-world settings, behaviors are probably not going to be reinforced each and every time they occur. For situations where you are purposely trying to train and reinforce an action, such as in the classroom, in sports or in animal training, you might opt to follow a specific reinforcement schedule. As you'll see below, some schedules are best suited to certain types of training situations. In some cases, training might call for starting out with one schedule and switching to another once the desired behavior has been taught.&lt;ref&gt;SKINNER, B. F. The behavior of organisms. New York: D. Appleton-Century Co., 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Example of operant conditioning

'''[[Positive reinforcement]]''': Whenever he is being good, cooperative, solves things non-aggressively, immediately reward those behaviors with praise, attention, goodies.

'''Punishment''': If acting aggressively, give immediate, undesired consequence (send to corner; say "NO!" and couple with response cost).

'''Response cost:''' Most common would be "time-out". Removing sources of attention by placing in an environment without other people. Careful: This can become (aversive) punishment, depending on how done. To be response cost, it can only simply be taking away a desirable thing; not adding a negative one.

'''[[Negative reinforcement]]:''' One example would be to couple negative reinforcement with response cost—after some period of time in which he has acted cooperatively or calmly while in the absence of others, can bring him back with others. Thus, taking away the isolation should reinforce the desired behavior (being cooperative).

'''Extinction:''' Simply ignoring behaviors should lead to extinction. Note: that initially when ignored, can expect an initial increase in the behavior—a very trying time in situations such as a child that is acting out.&lt;ref&gt;Zeilberger, J., Sampen, S., &amp; Sloan, H. (1968). Modification of a child's problem behaviors in the home with the mother as therapist. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 1, 47-53.)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for children who are otherwise ignored by their parents to turn to misbehavior as a way of seeking attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How can I discipline my children? |publisher=BBC |location= London |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/life/health_happiness/problems/discipline_home.shtml |accessdate = 13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a child screaming for attention. Parents often inadvertently reward the bad behavior by immediately giving them the attention, thereby reinforcing it. On the other hand, parents may wait until the child calms down and speaks politely, then reward the more polite behavior with the attention.

==== Natural consequences ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
Natural consequences involve children learning from their own mistakes. In this method, the parent's job is to teach the child which behaviors are inappropriate. In order to do this, parents should allow the child to make a mistake and let them experience the natural results from their behavior. For instance, if a child forgets to bring his lunch to school, he will find himself hungry later. Using natural consequences would be indicative of the theory of accomplishment of natural growth, which is the parenting style of the working class and poor.  The accomplishment of natural growth focuses on separation between children and family. Children are given directives and expected to carry them out without complaint or delay. Children are responsible for themselves during their free time, and the parent's main concern is caring for the children's physical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |title=Unequal Childhoods |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27142-5 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this method to be effective the parents cannot shield their child from harm or from getting in trouble. They must allow for the mistake to occur in order for the child to learn the consequences. For example, a basic natural consequence is that if the child touches a hot pot he will get burned. The consequence is usually immediate, and the parent may have little control when protecting the child. However, the pain is the consequence of touching the pot which will teach the child to not do that again.

====Internal discipline and democracy====
:''Main articles: [[School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools]] and [[Sudbury Valley School]]''

[[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury model]] democratic schools, attended by children ages 4 to 19, claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike.

Furthermore, they emphasize that much more important than the externals of order is the question of the sources of internal discipline: how does an individual come to develop the inner strength and character that endows his life with order and coherence, an independent person appropriate to a free republic of co-equal citizens, capable of making decisions within a rational, self-consistent framework—a person treating and being treated with respect?

They affirm that the hallmark of the independent person is the ability to bear responsibility and since there is no way of teaching or training another person for self-sufficiency, there is no technique for obtaining or transmitting these traits. Hence, the only way a person becomes responsible for himself is for him to be responsible for himself, with no reservation or qualifications. Thence the need to permit children, at home and school, freedom of choice, freedom of action, and freedom to bear the results of action—the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;The Crisis in American Education &amp;mdash; An Analysis and a Proposal, [http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html#02 The Sudbury Valley School] (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=The+Crisis+in+American+Education+%E2%80%94+An+Analysis+and+a+Proposal,+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+(1970),+Law+and+Order:+Foundations+of+Discipline ''Law and Order: Foundations of Discipline''] (pg. 49-55).

'''Chronemics''' is the study of the role of time in communication. It is one of several subcategories of the study of [[nonverbal communication]]. Other prominent  subcategories include [[Haptic communication|haptics]] (touch), [[kinesics]] (body movement), [[paralanguage|vocalics]] (paralanguage), and [[proxemics]] (the use of space).&lt;ref name="nina moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Nina|title=Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Thomas J. Bruneau of Radford University coined the term "chronemics" in the late 1970s to help define the function of time in human interaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chronemics can be briefly and generally defined as the study of human tempo as it related to human communication. More specifically, chronemics involves the study of both subjective and objective human tempos as they influence and are interdependent with human behavior. Further, chronemics involves the study of human communication as it relates to interdependent and integrated levels of time-experiencing. Previously, these interdependent and integrated levels have been outlined and discussed as: biological time; psychological time; social time; and cultural time. A number of classification systems exist in the literature of time. However, such systems are not applied to human interaction directly.&lt;ref name=Bruneau1980&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruneau|first=Thomas J.|editor-last=Key|editor-first=Mary Ritchie|year=1980|title=The Relationship of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbg98xnbIYwC|chapter=Chronemics and the Verbal-Nonverbal Interface|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbg98xnbIYwC&amp;pg=PA114|publisher=Mouton Press|pages=101–119|isbn=|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chronemics can be defined as "the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of time"{{Cite quote|date=October 2015}} – the way in which one perceives and values [[time]], structures time, and reacts to time frames communication. Time perception plays a large role in the nonverbal communication process. Time perceptions include [[punctuality]], willingness to wait, and interactions. The use of time can affect lifestyle, daily agendas, speed of speech, movements, and how long people are willing to listen.

Time can be used as an indicator of status. For example, in most companies the boss can interrupt progress to hold an impromptu meeting in the middle of the work day, yet the average worker would have to make an appointment to see the boss. The way in which different cultures perceive time can influence communication as well.

Cultures are sometimes{{When|date=October 2015}} considered '''monochronic''' or '''polychronic'''.

==Monochronic time==

A monochronic time system means that things are done one at a time and time is segmented into precise, small units. Under this system, time is scheduled, arranged and managed.&lt;ref name="time-sense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harley.com/writing/time-sense.html|title=Time Sense: Polychronicity and Monochronicity|date=January 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] considers itself a monochronic [[society]]. This perception came about during the [[Industrial Revolution]], when "factory life required the labor force to be on hand and in place at an appointed hour" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;238). Many Americans like to think that to them, time is a precious resource not to be wasted or taken lightly. "We buy time, save time, spend time and make time. Our time can be broken down into years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and even milliseconds. We use time to structure both our daily lives and events that we are planning for the future. We have schedules that we must follow: appointments that we must go to at a certain time, classes that start and end at certain times, work schedules that start and end at certain times, and even our favorite TV shows, that start and end at a certain time."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory80.htm |title=Chronemics |last1=Lewis |first1=Nick |date=November 17, 2003 |publisher=Colorado State University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215155552/http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory80.htm|archivedate=2005-02-15|accessdate=2015-10-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As communication scholar [[Edward T. Hall]] wrote regarding the American's viewpoint of time in the business world, "the schedule is sacred." Hall says that for monochronic cultures, such as the American culture, "time is tangible" and viewed as a commodity where "time is money" or "time is wasted." The result of this perspective is that monochronic cultures, place a paramount value on schedules, tasks and "getting the job done."{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}} These cultures are committed to regimented schedules and may view those who do not subscribe to the same perception of time as disrespectful, inefficient or unreliable.

==Polychronic time==

A polychronic time system is a system where several things can be done at once, and wider view of time is exhibited and time is perceived in large fluid sections.&lt;ref name="time-sense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harley.com/writing/time-sense.html|title=Time Sense: Polychronicity and Monochronicity|date=January 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of polychronic behaviors include: typing while answering telephones or taking notes while sitting participating in meetings. Polychronicity is in contrast to those who prefer monochronicity (doing one thing at a time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Keating |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-time-is-a-social-construct-164139110/?no-ist |title=Why Time is a Social Construct &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polychronic cultures are much less focused on the preciseness of accounting for each and every moment. As Raymond Cohen notes, polychronic cultures are more focused on tradition and relationships rather than on tasks—a clear difference from their monochronic counterparts. Cohen notes that "Traditional societies have all the time in the world.  The arbitrary divisions of the clock face have little saliency in cultures grounded in the cycle of the seasons, the invariant pattern of rural life, community life, and the calendar of religious festivities" (Cohen, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

Polychronic culture is more focused on relationships, rather than watching the clock. Polychronic societies have no problem being "late" for an appointment if they are deeply focused on some work or in a meeting that ran past schedule, because the concept of time is fluid and can easily expand or contract as need be. As a result, polychronic cultures have a much less formal perception of time. They are not ruled by precise calendars and schedules. Rather, "cultures that use the polychronic time system often schedule multiple appointments simultaneously so keeping on schedule is an impossibility."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

===Measuring polychronicity===
Researchers have developed the following questionnaires to measure polychronicity:

* '''Inventory of Polychronic Values (IPV)''', developed by Bluedorn et al. (1999) which is a 10-item scale designed to assess "the extent to which people in a culture prefer to be engaged in two or more tasks or events simultaneously and believe their preference is the best way to do things."
* '''Polychronic Attitude Index (PAI)''', developed by Kaufman-Scarborough &amp; Lindquist in 1991, which is a 4-item scale measuring individual preference for polychronicity, in the following statements:
*# "I do not like to juggle several activities at the same time".
*# "People should not try to do many things at once".
*# "When I sit down at my desk, I work on one project at a time".
*# "I am comfortable doing several things at the same time".

===Cross-cultural perspectives on time===

Conflicting attitudes between the monochronic and polychronic perceptions of time can interfere with cross-cultural relations, and similar challenges can occur within an otherwise assimilated culture.&lt;ref name="time-sense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harley.com/writing/time-sense.html|title=Time Sense: Polychronicity and Monochronicity|date=January 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example in the United States is the [[Culture of Hawaii|Hawaiian culture]], which employs two time systems: [[Haole]] time and Hawaiian time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you hear someone say, 'See you at two o'clock haole time,' they mean they will just that. Haole time is when the person will meet when they say they will meet. But if you were to hear someone say, 'I'll be there at two o'clock Hawaiian time,' then something different is implied. Hawaiian time is very lax and it basically means 'when you get there.'" —Nick Lewis&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Time orientations ==

The way an individual perceives time and the role time plays in their lives is a learned perspective.  As discussed by Alexander Gonzalez and Phillip Zimbardo, "every child learns a time perspective that is appropriate to the values and needs of his society" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;227).

There are four basic psychological time orientations:
# Past
# Time-line
# Present
# Future

Each orientation affects the structure, content, and urgency of communication (Burgoon, 1989).   The [[past]] orientation has a hard time developing the notion of elapsed time and these individuals often confuse present and past happenings as all in the same.  People oriented with time-line cognitivity are often detail oriented and think of everything in linear terms. These individuals also often have difficulty with comprehending multiple events at the same time.  Individuals with a present orientation are mostly characterized as pleasure seekers who live for the moment and have a very low risk aversion.  Those individuals who operate with [[future orientation]] are often thought of as being highly goal oriented and focused on the broad picture.

The use of time as a communicative channel can be a powerful, yet subtle, force in face-to-face ''interactions''. Some of the more recognizable types of interaction that use time are:

;Regulating interaction: This is shown to aid in the orderly transition of conversational [[Turn-Taking|turn-taking]]. When the speaker is opening the floor for a response, they will pause. However, when no response is desired, the speaker will talk a faster pace with minimal pause. (Capella, 1985)
;Expressing intimacy: As relationships become more intimate, certain changes are made to accommodate the new relationship status. Some of the changes that are made include lengthening the time spent on mutual gazes, increasing the amount of time doing tasks for or with the other person and planning for the future by making plans to spend more time together (Patterson, 1990).
;Affect management: The onset of powerful emotions can cause a stronger affect, ranging from joy to sorrow or even to embarrassment. Some of the behaviors associated with negative affects include decreased time of gaze and awkwardly long pauses during conversations. When this happens, it is common for the individuals to try and decrease any negative affects and subsequently strengthen positive affects (Edelman &amp; Iwawaki, 1987).
;Evoking emotion: Time can be used to evoke emotions in an interpersonal relationship by communicating the value of the relationship. For example, when someone who you have a close relationship with is late, you may not take it personally, especially if that is characteristic of them. However, if it is a meeting with a total stranger, their disrespect for the value of your time may be taken personally and could even cause you to display negative emotions if and when they do arrive for the meeting.
;Facilitating service and task goals: Professional settings can sometimes give rise to interpersonal relations which are quite different from other "normal" interactions. For example, the societal norms that dictate minimal touch between strangers are clearly altered if one member of the dyad is a doctor, and the environment is that of a hospital examination room.

===Time orientation and consumers===
Time orientation has also revealed insights into how people react to advertising. Martin, Gnoth and Strong (2009) found that future-oriented consumers react most favorably to ads that feature a product to be released in the distant future and that highlight primary product attributes. In contrast, present-oriented consumers prefer near-future ads that highlight secondary product attributes. Consumer attitudes were mediated by the perceived usefulness of the attribute information.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, B.A.S., Gnoth, J., &amp; Strong, C. (2009). [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Gnoth-Strong-2009.pdf Temporal construal in advertising: The moderating role of temporal orientation and attribute importance upon consumer evaluations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217085226/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Gnoth-Strong-2009.pdf |date=2013-12-17 }}, ''Journal of Advertising'', 38 (3), 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and diplomacy ==

=== Cultural roots ===
Just as monochronic and polychronic cultures have different time perspectives, understanding the time orientation of a culture is critical to becoming better able to successfully handle [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] situations. Americans think they have, a future orientation. Hall indicates that for Americans "tomorrow is more important" and that they "are oriented almost entirely toward the future" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;35). The future-focused orientation attributes to at least some of the concern that Americans have with "addressing immediate issues and moving on to new challenges" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;35).

On the other hand, many polychronic cultures have a past-orientation toward time.

These time perspectives are the seeds for communication clashes in diplomatic situations. Trade negotiators have observed that "American negotiators are generally more anxious for agreement because "they are always in a hurry" and basically "problem solving oriented." In other words, they place a high value on resolving an issue quickly calling to mind the American catchphrase "some solution is better than no solution" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;114). Similar observations have been made of [[Japan]]ese-American relations. Noting the difference in time perceptions between the two countries, former ambassador to [[Tokyo]], [[Mike Mansfield]] commented "We're too fast, they're too slow" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;118).

=== Influence on global affairs ===

Different perceptions of time across cultures can influence global communication. When writing about time perspective, Gonzalez and Zimbardo comment that "There is no more powerful, pervasive influence on how individuals think and cultures interact than our different perspectives on time—the way we learn how we mentally partition time into past, present and future." (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;227)

Depending upon where an individual is from, their perception of time might be that "the [[clock]] rules the day" or that "we'll get there when we get there."{{Cite quote|date=October 2015}}
Improving prospects for success in the global community requires understanding cultural differences, [[traditions]] and communication styles.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}}

The monochronic-oriented approach to negotiations is direct, linear and rooted in the characteristics that illustrate low context tendencies. The low context  culture approaches diplomacy in a lawyerly, dispassionate fashion with a clear idea of acceptable outcomes and a plan for reaching them. Draft arguments would be prepared elaborating positions. A monochronic culture, more concerned with time, deadlines and schedules, tends to grow impatient and want to rush to "close the deal."

More polychronic-oriented cultures come to diplomatic situations with no particular importance placed on time. Chronemics is one of the channels of [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] communication preferred by a High context Polychronic negotiator over verbal communication.The polychronic approach to negotiations will emphasis building trust between participants, forming coalitions and finding consensus. High context Polychronic negotiators might be charged with emotion toward a subject thereby obscuring an otherwise obvious solution.

== Control of time in power relationships ==
{{Also|Personal boundaries}}
Time has a definite relationship to [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Though power most often refers to the ability to influence people (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;314), power is also related to dominance and status (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;315).

For example, in the workplace, those in a leadership or management position treat time and – by virtue of position – have their time treated differently from those who are of a lower stature position. Anderson and Bowman have identified three specific examples of how chronemics and power converge in the [[workplace]] – waiting time, talk time and work time.

=== Waiting time ===
Researchers Insel and Lindgren (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;325) write that the act of making an individual of a lower stature wait is a sign of dominance. They note that one who "is in the position to cause another to wait has power over him. To be kept waiting is to imply that one's time is less valuable than that of the one who imposes the wait."

=== Talk time ===
There is a direct correlation between the power of an individual in an organization and conversation. This includes both length of conversation, turn-taking and who initiates and ends a conversation. Extensive research indicates that those with more power in an organization will speak more often and for a greater length of time. Meetings between superiors and subordinates provide an opportunity to illustrate this concept. A superior – regardless of whether or not they are running the actual meeting – lead discussions, ask questions and have the ability to speak for longer periods of time without interruption. Likewise, research shows that turn-taking is also influenced by power. Social psychologist Nancy Henley notes that "Subordinates are expected to yield to superiors and there is a cultural expectation that a subordinate will not interrupt a superior" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;326). The length of response follows the same pattern. While the superior can speak for as long as they want, the responses of the subordinate are shorter in length. [[Albert Mehrabian]] noted that deviation from this pattern led to negative perceptions of the subordinate by the superior. Beginning and ending a communication interaction in the workplace is also controlled by the higher-status individual in an organization. The time and duration of the conversation are dictated by the higher-status individual.

=== Work time === 
The time of high status individuals is perceived as valuable, and they control their own time. On the other hand, a subordinate with less power has their time controlled by a higher status individual and are in less control of their time – making them likely to report their time to a higher authority. Such practices are more associated with those in non-supervisory roles or in blue collar rather than [[White-collar worker|white collar]] professions. Instead, as power and status in an organization increases, the flexibility of the work schedule also increases. For instance, while administrative professionals might keep a [[Working time#9-to-5|9 to 5]] work schedule, their superiors may keep less structured hours. This does not mean that the superior works less. They may work longer, but the structure of their work environment is not strictly dictated by the traditional work day. Instead, as Koehler and their associates note "individuals who spend more time, especially spare time, to meetings, to committees, and to developing contacts, are more likely to be influential decision makers" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;327).

A specific example of the way power is expressed through work time is scheduling. As Yakura and others have noted in research shared by Ballard and Seibold, "scheduling reflects the extent to which the sequencing and duration of plans activities and events are formalized" (Ballard and Seibold, p.&amp;nbsp;6). Higher-status individuals have very precise and formal schedules – indicating that their stature requires that they have specific blocks of time for specific meetings, projects and appointments. Lower status individuals however, may have less formalized schedules. Finally, the schedule and appointment calendar of the higher status individual will take precedence in determining where, when and the importance of a specific event or appointment.

== Associated theories ==

=== Expectancy violations theory ===
Developed by [[Judee Burgoon]], [[expectancy violations theory]] (EVT) sees communication as the exchange of information which is high in relational content and can be used to violate the expectations of another which will be perceived as either positively or negatively depending on the liking between the two people.

When our expectations are violated, we will respond in specific ways. If an act is unexpected and is assigned favorable interpretation, and it is evaluated positively, it will produce more favorable outcomes than an expected act with the same interpretation and evaluation.

=== Interpersonal adaptation theory ===
{{Main|Interpersonal adaptation theory}}
The interpersonal adaptation theory (IAT), founded by Judee Burgoon, states that adaptation in interaction is responsive to the needs, expectations, and desires of communicators and affects how communicators position themselves in relation to one another and adapt to one another's communication. For example, they may match each other's behavior, synchronize the timing of behavior, or behave in dissimilar ways. It is also important to note that individuals bring to interactions certain requirements that reflect basic human needs, expectations about behavior based on social norms, and desires for interaction based on goals and personal preferences (Burgoon, Stern &amp; Dillman, 1995).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3630">In [[macroeconomics]], the '''classical dichotomy''' is the idea, attributed to [[classical economics|classical]] and pre-[[Keynesian]] economics, that [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real and nominal variables]] can be analyzed separately. To be precise, an economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if real variables such as output  and [[real interest rate]]s can be completely analyzed without considering what is happening to their nominal counterparts, the money value of output and the interest rate. In particular, this means that [[real GDP]] and other real variables can be determined without knowing the level of the nominal [[money supply]] or the rate of [[inflation]].  An economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if money is [[neutrality of money|neutral]], affecting only the price level, not real variables.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The classical dichotomy was integral to the thinking of some pre-Keynesian economists ("[[Veil of money|money as a veil]]") as a long-run proposition and is found today in [[new classical economics|new classical]] theories of macroeconomics. In new classical macroeconomics there is a short-run [[Phillips curve]] which can shift vertically according to the [[rational expectations]] being reviewed continuously. In the strict sense, money is not neutral in the short-run, that is, classical dichotomy does not hold, since agents tend to respond to changes in prices and in the quantity of money through changing their supply decisions. However, money should be neutral in the long run, and the classical dichotomy should be restored in the long-run, since there was no relationship between prices and real macroeconomic performance at the data level. This view has serious economic policy consequences. In the long-run, owing to the dichotomy, money is not assumed to be an effective instrument in controlling macroeconomic performance, while in the short-run there is a trade-off between prices and output (or unemployment), but, owing to rational expectations, government cannot exploit it in order to build a systematic countercyclical economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics. A Positive Critique |location=Heidelberg/New York/Dordrecht/London |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |isbn= 978-3-319-17578-2 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-17578-2 |url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-17578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] and [[Monetarism|monetarists]] reject the classical dichotomy, because they argue that prices are [[sticky (economics)|sticky]]. That is, they think prices fail to adjust in the [[Long run and short run|short run]], so that an increase in the money supply raises [[aggregate demand]] and thus alters real macroeconomic variables. [[Post-Keynesians]] reject the classic dichotomy as well, for different reasons, emphasizing the role of banks in [[money creation|creating money]], as in [[monetary circuit theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">'''Cognitive functioning''' is a term referring to an individual’s ability to process to (thoughts) that should not deplete on a large scale in healthy individuals. It is defined as "the ability of an individual to perform the various mental activities most closely associated with learning and problem solving. Examples include verbal, spatial, psychomotor, and processing-speed ability."&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognition]] mainly refers to things like [[memory]], the ability to learn new information, speech, [[reading comprehension|understanding of written material]].  The [[brain]] is usually capable of learning new skills in the aforementioned areas, typically in early childhood, and of developing personal thoughts and beliefs about the world.  Old age and disease may affect cognitive function, causing [[memory loss]] and trouble thinking of the right words while speaking or writing ("drawing a blank").  [[Multiple sclerosis]] (MS), for example, can eventually cause memory loss, an inability to grasp new concepts or information, and depleted verbal fluency.  Not all with the condition will experience this side effect, and most will retain their general intellect and the ability.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

Humans generally have a capacity for cognitive function once born, so almost every person is capable of learning or remembering. However, this is tested using tests like the [[IQ test]], although these have issues with accuracy and completeness.  In these tests, the patient will be asked a series of questions or to perform tasks, with each measuring a cognitive skill,{{fact|date=February 2013}} such as level of consciousness, memory, awareness, problem-solving, motor skills, analytical abilities, or other similar concepts.{{fact|date=February 2013}} [[Early childhood]] is when most people are best able to absorb and use new information.  In this period, children learn new words, concepts, and various methods to express themselves.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">'''Constructive perception''', is the theory of [[perception]] in which the perceiver uses sensory information and other sources of information to construct a cognitive understanding of a stimulus. In contrast to this top-down approach, there is the bottom-up approach of [[direct perception]].

Also known as intelligent perception, constructive perception shows the relationship between [[intelligence]] and perception. This comes from the importance of high-order thinking and learning in perception. During perception, hypotheses are formed and tested about [[percept]]s that are based on three things: sensory data, knowledge, and high-level cognitive processes. Visual sensations are usually correctly attributed because we unconsciously assimilate information from many sources and then unconsciously make judgments based on this information. The philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] explains that our perception of the world is reciprocal; it both is affected by and affects our experience of the world.

== Evidence of constructive perception ==
[[Context effects]] are not explained by bottom-up theories of accounting. [[Irving Biederman]] performed experiments that demonstrated dramatic context effects. For example, Stephen Palmer carried out an experiment in which the participants were asked to identify objects after they were shown either a relevant or irrelevant context. They might be shown a scene of a baseball game, followed by images of a baseball, car, and a phone. The stimuli that was most relevant to the context, the baseball, was recognized quicker than those that were irrelevant, car and phone.

[[Perceptual constancy]] gives evidence that high-level constructive processes occur during perception. As lighting conditions change, the color of objects, such as bananas or cherries, appear to remain constant. Even when there is not enough light to even stimulate [[cone cells]] and give the sensation of color, bananas and cherries are still perceived as yellow and red, respectively.

Configural-superiority effect is another compelling context effect. This effect is demonstrated by the decrease in response time by participants when identifying objects in complex configurations over objects in isolation. For example, four diagonal lines are shown and participants are asked the location of the odd line indicated by its different orientation. In another condition, an "L" shaped fixed context is added; this creates three triangles and another object made of three lines. Participants were able to discern the odd three line object from the set of triangles quicker than the single diagonal lines alone.

== Examples ==
You are traveling down a road you never been on before, up ahead you see an octagonal red sign with white letters near an intersection. The sign has a vine growing on it, and all you can read is "ST_P." These letters alone are meaningless, however taken in its context and using knowledge from past experiences you infer that it is a stop sign. This is example of constructive perception because it required intelligence and thought to combine sensory information, a red octagonal sign with "ST_P" in white letters at an intersection, and knowledge from past experiences, stop signs are red octagonal signs with "STOP" in white letters placed at an intersection, to perceive it as a stop sign.

'''Distributed Tree Search''' (DTS) algorithm is a class of algorithms for searching values in an efficient and distributed manner. Their purpose is to iterate through a tree by working along multiple branches in parallel and merging the results of each branch into one common solution, in order to minimize time spent searching for a value in a tree-like data structure.

The original paper was written in 1988 by Chris Ferguson and Richard E. Korf, from the University of California's Computer Science Department. They used multiple other chess AIs to develop this wider range algorithm.

== Overview ==
The Distributed Tree Search Algorithm (also known as Korf-Ferguson algorithm) was created to solve the following problem : « Given a tree with non-uniform branching factor and depth, search it in parallel with an arbitrary number of processors as fast as possible. »

The top-level part of this algorithm is general and does not use a particular existing type of tree-search, but it can be easily specialized to fit any type of non-distributed tree-search.

DTS consists of using multiple processes, each with a node and a set of processors attached, with the goal of searching the sub-tree below the said node. Each process then divides itself into multiple coordinated sub-processes which recursively divide themselves again until an optimal way to search the tree has been found based on the number of processors available to each process. Once a process finishes, DTS dynamically reassigns the processors to other processes as to keep the efficiency to a maximum through good load-balancing, especially in irregular trees.

Once a process finishes searching, it recursively sends and merges a resulting signal to its parent-process, until all the different sub-answers have been merged and the entire problem has been solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaaipress.org/Papers/AAAI/1988/AAAI88-023.pdf|title=Distributed Tree Search and it's Application to Alpha-Beta Pruning|last=KORF Richard E., FERGUSON Chris|first=|date=1988|website=AAAI|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
DTS is only applicable under two major conditions: the data structure to search through is a tree, and the algorithm can make use of at least one computation unit (Although it cannot be considered as distributed if there is only one).

One major example of the everyday use of DTS is network routing. The Internet can be seen as a tree of IP addresses, and an analogy to a routing protocol could be how post offices work in the real world. Since there are over 4.3 billion IP addresses currently, society heavily depends on the time the data takes to find its way to its destination. As such, IP-routing divides the work into multiple sub-units which each have different scales of calculation capabilities and use each other's result to find the route in a very efficient manner. This is an instance of DTS that affects over 43% of the world's population, for reasons going from entertainment to national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metaswitch.com/resources/what-is-ip-routing|title=What is IP Routing ?|last=|first=|date=2016|website=MetaSwitch|publisher=MetaSwitch Networks|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Although DTS is currently one of the most widely used algorithms, many of its applications have alternatives to them which could potentially develop into more efficient, less resource-demanding solutions, were they more researched.

One of the more controversial examples is Big-Data processing. In applications like Google Search Engine, Facebook, YouTube, search needs to be optimized to keep waiting time inside a reasonable window. This could be achieved through the plain use of DTS, but other algorithms are used in place (for example data-hashing in SQL databases), or in conjunction (Facebook's Haystack algorithm groups parallel tree-search, data-hashing and memory-ordering/sorting).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/685565858139515/needle-in-a-haystack-efficient-storage-of-billions-of-photos/|title=Needle in a Haystack : Efficient Storage of Billions of Photos|last=Vajgel|first=Peter|date=April 30, 2009|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook (company)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more important limits of DTS is the fact that it requires a tree as input. Trees are a sub-instance of a data structure known as Graphs, which means every Graph can be converted into a tree. Although there currently exists no better way to search through trees than Korf-Ferguson's algorithm, each task has different particularities and in most cases, there will exist more efficient data structures to represent the problem and solve it than through tree-search. And so there exist instances of tree structures with cycles that cannot possibly be faster than a graph-search on the same structure with the same processing power.

== Controversy ==
There are few controversies around Korf-Ferguson's DTS algorithm, since it is recognized as very complete, but simple. It is very often used as a stepping stone for students to discover the fundamentals and key concepts of distributed problem-solving.

The most important challenge to this algorithmic concept was an article by Kröll B, « Balanced Distributed Sarch Trees Do Not Exist », which does not attack the veracity or current efficiency of the algorithm, but rather the fact that DTS itself, no matter how many improvements are made to it (for example balancing the input tree before-hand), will never be able to reach optimal resolution-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-60220-8_50|title=Balanced distributed search trees do not exist|last=Kröll|first=Brigitte|last2=Widmayer|first2=Peter|date=1995-08-16|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540602200|editor-last=Akl|editor-first=Selim G.|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=50–61|language=en|editor-last2=Dehne|editor-first2=Frank|editor-last3=Sack|editor-first3=Jörg-Rüdiger|editor-last4=Santoro|editor-first4=Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opens a new view point : are too many resources used into the completion of DTS, which blocks new algorithms with higher efficiency-potential from getting researched and developed ? Another limit of DTS is the fact that no matter how efficient the division, coordination and merging of the solutions is, it will always be limited by the material number or processors and their processing power. Until recently, this was admitted as being a limit to nearly every computation, but new-generation algorithms like Euclideon might one day be able to crush DFS's efficiency through processing-power-independent problem resolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12698">'''Electronic entropy''' is the [[entropy]] of a system attributable to electrons' probabilistic occupation of states. This entropy can take a number of forms. The first form can be termed a [[density of states]] based entropy. The [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution]] implies that each eigenstate of a system, {{math|''i''}}, is occupied with a certain probability, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As the entropy is given by a sum over the probabilities of occupation of those states, there is an entropy associated with the occupation of the various electronic states. In most molecular systems, the energy spacing between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is usually large, and thus the probabilities associated with the occupation of the excited states are small. Therefore, the electronic entropy in molecular systems can safely be neglected. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the [[Fermi level]] can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior.&lt;ref name='Wolverton 1995'&gt;{{cite journal

==From the density of states==

===General Formulation===

The entropy due to a set of states that can be either occupied with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; or empty with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B}\sum_i n_i [ p_i \ln p_i + (1-p_i) \ln( 1 - p_i ) ] &lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math| ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[Boltzmann constant]].

For a continuously distributed set of states as a function of energy, such as the eigenstates in an [[electronic band structure]], the above sum can be written as an integral over the possible energy values, rather than a sum. Switching from summing over individual states to integrating over energy levels, the entropy can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B} \int n(E) \left [ p(E) \ln p(E) +(1- p(E)) \ln \left ( 1- p(E)\right )  \right ]dE &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''(''E'')}} is the [[density of states]] of the solid. The probability of occupation of each eigenstate is given by the Fermi function, {{math|''f''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p(E)=f=\frac{1}{e^{(E-E_{\rm F}) / k_{\rm B} T} + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi energy]] and {{math|''T''}} is the absolute temperature. One can then re-write the entropy as:
:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B} \int n(E) \left [ f \ln f +(1- f) \ln \left ( 1- f \right )  \right ]dE &lt;/math&gt;
This is the general formulation of the density-of-states based electronic entropy.

===Useful approximation===

It is useful to recognize that the only states within ~{{math|{{plusmn}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} of the Fermi level contribute significantly to the entropy. Other states are either fully occupied, {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}, or completely unoccupied, {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}}. In either case, these states do not contribute to the entropy. If one assumes that the density of states is constant within {{math|{{plusmn}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} of the Fermi level, one can derive that the electronic entropy is equal to:&lt;ref name=Nicholson1995 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S=\frac{\pi}{3} k_{\rm B}^2 T n(E_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the density of states at the Fermi level. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level. As the density of states at the Fermi level varies widely between systems, this approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system; only systems with large densities of states at the Fermi level should exhibit non-negligible electronic entropy (where large may be approximately defined as {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ (''k''{{su|b=B|p=2}}''T'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

== Application to different materials classes ==
'''Insulators''' have zero density of states at the Fermi level due to their [[band gap]]s. Thus, the density of states-based electronic entropy is essentially zero in these systems.

'''Metals''' have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Transition metals, wherein the flat d-bands lie close to the Fermi level, generally exhibit much larger electronic entropies than the free-electron like metals.

'''Oxides''' have particularly flat band structures and thus can exhibit large {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, if the Fermi level intersects these bands. As most oxides are insulators, this is generally not the case. However, when oxides are metallic (i.e. the Fermi level lies within an unfilled, flat set of bands), oxides exhibit some of the largest electronic entropies of any material.

'''Thermoelectric materials''' are specifically engineered to have large electronic entropies. The [[thermoelectric effect]] relies on charge carriers exhibiting large entropies, as the driving force to establish a gradient in electrical potential is driven by the entropy associated with the charge carriers. In the thermoelectric literature, the term ''band structure engineering'' refers to the manipulation of material structure and chemistry to achieve a high density of states near the Fermi level. More specifically, thermoelectric materials are intentionally doped to exhibit only partially filled bands at the Fermi level, resulting in high electronic entropies.&lt;ref name=Pei2012&gt;{{cite journal

==Configurational electronic entropy==
Configurational electronic entropy is usually observed in mixed-valence transition metal oxides, as the charges in these systems are both localized (the system is ionic), and capable of changing (due to the mixed valency). To a first approximation (i.e. assuming that the charges are distributed randomly), the molar configurational electronic entropy is given by:&lt;ref name=Zhou2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \approx n_\text{sites} \left [ x \ln  x + (1-x) \ln (1-x) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;sites&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the fraction of sites on which a localized electron/hole could reside (typically a transition metal site), and {{math|''x''}} is the concentration of localized electrons/holes. Of course, the localized charges are not distributed randomly, as the charges will interact electrostatically with one another, and so the above formula should only be regarded as an approximation to the configurational atomic entropy. More sophisticated approximations have been made in the literature.&lt;ref name=Zhou2006 /&gt;

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.

'''Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Learning''' is an Orthodox Jewish organization designed to reach out to [[secular Judaism|secular]] and non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]s in the hopes of bringing them into the [[Baal teshuva movement]].

==History==
Officially incorporated on November 30, 1983,&lt;ref name=corp/&gt; Etz Chaim is a multi-faceted outreach center dedicated to reaching Jews of all backgrounds to experience [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schifrin, Daniel. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222799315/ For Baltimore, A New Expo-sure: At the Jewish Food &amp; Life Expo, everything from matzoh balls to marriage]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. November 8, 1991. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its programs, Etz Chaim helps people find study partners for the process of [[Jewish conversion|conversion]] to Orthodox Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Schifrin, Daniel. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222861829/ Judaism Begins At Home: For Doris Feinstein Pollock, conversion instructor, the home is where Jews by choice should discover Judaism.]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 26, 1993. p. 38. &lt;/ref&gt; Etz Chaim says that success is when a person considers their [[Jewish identity]] more valuable, when a person chooses not to [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarry]], or when a person does one [[mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Richard.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222836269 Getting The Word Out: Jewish outreach workers recommit themselves to strengthening religious observance]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. May 23, 1997. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992, a [[Lubavitch]] family advertised and held Jewish services, ceremonies, and celebrations in their house in Baltimore County.&lt;ref name=homeashul&gt;Lechtman, Jay. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222829213/ When Is A Home A Shul?] ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. February 14, 1992. p. 26. &lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors complained to the local zoning commission, stating that the family were using their home as a synagogue, in direct violation of local zoning laws, parking laws, and noise restrictions.&lt;ref name=homeashul/&gt; Etz Chaim supported the family, stating that enforcing such laws on a place of worship was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=homeashul/&gt;

In 1992, Etz Chaim supported detailed recommendations regarding Jewish celebrations that restricted [[kiddush]] to only one hot dish, cake, and drinks, while a [[b'nai mitzvah]] or wedding celebration may have up to two hot dishes.&lt;ref name= spending&gt;Eisenstadt, Merrie M. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222826957/ Scaling Down Spending Is An Uphill Battle]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 27, 1992. p. 23.  &lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations stated that all religious celebrations be held only at a synagogue itself or a synagogue's facilities.&lt;ref name=spending/&gt;

In 1993, Etz Chaim honored Marc Hurwitz for his working helping college students discover or maintain their Jewish identities and fighting [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, Alan H. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222862550/ Marc Of An Activist: From singles to college students to world Jewry, no cause eludes the self-effacing Marc Hurwitz]".  ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. June 25, 1993. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Etz Chaim moved its headquarters from Northeast Baltimore to [[downtown Baltimore|Center City Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Faygie.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/227253081/ City Addition: Jewish outreach center makes a move downtown]". ''Jewish Exponent'' (Philadelphia_. November 12, 1998. p. 13. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a bill was proposed to prohibiting discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] with regard to public accommodations, housing, and employment in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mlis.state.md.us/2001rs/billfile/SB0205.htm Senate Bill 205]". ''State of Maryland''. April 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Etz Chaim opposed the bill, stating that Orthodox Judaism opposes [[Homosexuality and Judaism|homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Walike, Deborah. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222804961/ Pride and Petition: Some Orthodox Jews join Christian conservatives in opposing Maryland's new protections for homosexuals]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. July 6, 2001. p. 12. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a choir of 61 mixed-gender students in third through fifth grades prepared to sing at a Jewish food and life expo. When Etz Chaim was asked whether it was religiously appropriate for female and male children to sing together, Etz Chaim determined the performance should not go forward.&lt;ref&gt;Harac, Lani. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222805115/ Sounds Of Silence: A coed children's choir performance at an upcoming Jewish gathering was canceled due to Jewish legal concerns]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. December 14, 2001. p. 16. &lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2002, a fire destroyed the Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Phil; Rubin, Neil. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222817466/ Unextinguished Spirit: After a suspicious fire, Etz Chaim Center staffers and students regroup and push on]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''.

''Baltimore Jewish Times''. February 22, 2002. p. 14. &lt;/ref&gt; With money from its insurance carrier and several donors, Etz Chaim was able to rebuild.&lt;ref&gt;Buckelew, Karen.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222788733/ New Start; Etz Chaim prepares to rebuild its Upper Park Heights headquarters]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 05, 2004. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The new, larger facility included a [[Shabbaton]] center,  coffee shop, and library,&lt;ref name= reinventing&gt;Jacobs, Phil.

''Baltimore Jewish Times'' June 24, 2005. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">{{Utilitarianism}}
The '''felicific calculus''' is an [[algorithm]] formulated by [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832) for calculating the degree or amount of [[pleasure]] that a specific action is likely to cause.  Bentham, an [[ethics|ethical]] [[hedonist]], believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced.  The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act.  The algorithm is also known as the '''utility calculus''', the '''hedonistic calculus''' and the '''hedonic calculus'''.

To be included in this calculation are several [[Variable (math)|variable]]s (or [[vector space|vector]]s), which Bentham called "circumstances". These are:
# Intensity&lt;!--Do NOT link this to [[Intensity]]!--&gt;: How strong is the pleasure?
# [[Time|Duration]]: How long will the pleasure last?
# [[Certainty]] or [[uncertainty]]: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will occur?
# [[Propinquity]] or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure occur?
# [[Fecundity]]: The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind.
# [[wiktionary:Purity|Purity]]: The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.
# [[wikt:extent|Extent]]: How many people will be affected?

==Bentham's instructions==
To take an exact account of the general tendency of any act, by which the interests of a community are affected, proceed as follows. Begin with any one person of those whose interests seem most immediately to be affected by it: and take an account,
* Of the value of each distinguishable pleasure which appears to be produced by it in the first instance.
* Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it in the first instance.
* Of the value of each pleasure which appears to be produced by it after the first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pleasure and the impurity of the first pain.
* Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it after the first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pain, and the impurity of the first pleasure.
* Sum up all the values of all the pleasures on the one side, and those of all the pains on the other. The balance, if it be on the side of pleasure, will give the good tendency of the act upon the whole, with respect to the interests of that individual person; if on the side of pain, the bad tendency of it upon the whole.
* Take an account of the number of persons whose interests appear to be concerned; and repeat the above process with respect to each. Sum up the numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency, which the act has, with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole. Do this again with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is bad upon the whole. Take the balance which if on the side of pleasure, will give the general good tendency of the act, with respect to the total number or community of individuals concerned; if on the side of pain, the general evil tendency, with respect to the same community.&lt;ref&gt;* Jeremy Bentham, ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', London, 1789&lt;/ref&gt;

To make his proposal easier to remember, Bentham devised what he called a "[[mnemonic]] [[doggerel]]" (also referred to as "memoriter verses"), which synthesized "the whole fabric of morals and legislation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intense, long, certain, speedy, fruitful, pure—&lt;br&gt;
Such marks in pleasures and in pains endure.&lt;br&gt;
Such pleasures seek if private be thy end:&lt;br&gt;
If it be public, wide let them extend&lt;br&gt;
Such pains avoid, whichever be thy view:&lt;br&gt;
If pains must come, let them extend to few. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hedons and dolors==

The [[units of measurements]] used in the felicific calculus may be termed ''hedons'' and ''dolors''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Glossary.html San Diego University&amp;nbsp;– Glossary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509083021/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Glossary.html |date=May 9, 2008 }} by Lawrence M. Hinman &lt;/ref&gt; They may be regarded as similar to the utilitarian posends and negends.

A '''genus–differentia [[definition]]''' is a type of [[Extensional and intensional definitions#Intensional definition|intensional definition]], and it is composed of two parts:

# '''a [[Genus_(philosophy)|genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the [[differentia]]''': The portion of the definition that is not provided by the genus.
For example, consider these two definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.
Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two ''differentiae'':
# ''one genus'':
#* ''the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral'': "A plane figure"
# ''two differentiae'':
#* ''the differentia for a triangle'': "that has 3 straight bounding sides."
#* ''the differentia for a quadrilateral'': "that has 4 straight bounding sides."

== Differentiation and Abstraction ==

The process of producing new definitions by ''extending'' existing definitions is commonly known as '''differentiation''' (and also as '''derivation'''). The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called '''[[abstraction]]'''; the new definition is called ''an&amp;nbsp;abstraction'' and it is said to have been ''abstracted away from'' the existing definition.

For instance, consider the following:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
A part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles&lt;/span&gt;), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
and with that part, an abstraction may be formed:
* &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

Similarly, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be rearranged and another portion singled out:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length&lt;/span&gt;), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.
leading to the following abstraction:
* &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that has interior angles which are all right angles.

In fact, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.
Hence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.

== Multiplicity ==

When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' is a member of both the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rectangle&lt;/span&gt;'' and the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rhombus&lt;/span&gt;''. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
or completely equivalently:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.

More generally, a collection of &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; genera. Thus, the following:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* &amp;hellip;
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
could be recast as:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a&amp;hellip; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.

== Structure ==

A genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an ''[[is-a|is-a relationship]]'':
* A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a&amp;hellip;
The non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a ''[[has-a|has-a relationship]]'':
* A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.
* A square has a straight bounding side.
* A square has a&amp;hellip;

When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a [[hierarchy]] or—more generally—a [[directed acyclic graph]]; a node that has no [[Directed graph|predecessor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most general definition''; each node along a directed path is ''more '''differentiated''''' (or ''more '''derived''''') than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no [[Directed graph|successor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most differentiated'' (or ''a&amp;nbsp;most derived'') definition.

When a definition, ''S'', is the [[Directed graph|tail]] of each of its successors (that is, ''S'' has at least one successor and each [[Directed graph|direct successor]] of ''S'' is a most differentiated definition), then ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the '''[[species]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; of each of its successors, and each direct successor of ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[individual]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; (or &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[entity]]'''''&lt;/span&gt;) of the species ''S''; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]''&lt;/span&gt; of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:
* ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'': a human that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'.
In this case:
* The whole definition is ''an&amp;nbsp;individual''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual.
* The genus of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "a&amp;nbsp;human") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual of the species ''&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; human''.
* The differentia of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;identity'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is the one "that has the name 'John Smith'".

As in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in [[linguistics]] as a ''[[pars pro toto|pars&amp;nbsp;pro&amp;nbsp;toto]] [[synecdoche]]''.

'''Grace''' is a feminine [[given name]] from the Latin ''gratia''.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Hanks, Hardcastle and Hodges, ''Oxford Dictionary of First Names'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2nd edition, {{ISBN|978-0-19-861060-1}}, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often given in reference to the [[Christian]] concept of [[divine grace]] and used as a virtue name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32312">{{about|the classical approach to Green's functions|a modern discussion|fundamental solution}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Green's function''' is the [[impulse response]] of an [[inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation|inhomogeneous]] linear [[differential equation]] defined on a domain, with specified initial conditions or boundary conditions.

Through the [[superposition principle]] for [[linear operator]] problems, the [[convolution]] of a Green's function with an arbitrary function {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} on that domain is the solution to the inhomogeneous differential equation for  {{math|''f'' (''x'')}}.
In other words, given a [[linear differential equation|linear ordinary differential equation]] (ODE), ''L''(solution) = source, one can first solve {{math|''L''(green) {{=}} ''δ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, for each {{mvar|s}}, and realizing that, since the source is a sum of [[delta function]]s, the solution is a sum of Green's functions as well, by linearity of {{mvar|L}}.

Green's functions are named after the British [[mathematician]] [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]], who first developed the concept in the 1830s. In the modern study of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, Green's functions are studied largely from the point of view of [[fundamental solution]]s instead.

Under [[Green's function (many-body theory)|many-body theory]], the term is also used in [[physics]], specifically in [[quantum field theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[aeroacoustics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[seismology]] and [[statistical field theory]], to refer to various types of [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]], even those that do not fit the mathematical definition. In quantum field theory, Green's functions take the roles of [[propagator]]s.

==Definition and uses==
A Green's function, {{math|''G''(''x,s'')}}, of a [[linear differential operator]]  {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''L''(''x'')}} acting on [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] over a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, at a point  {{math|''s''}}, is any solution of
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;LG(x,s)=\delta(s-x),&lt;/math&gt;|3=(1)|RawN=.}}
where  {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. This property of a Green's function can be exploited to solve differential equations of the form
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;|3=(2)|RawN=.}}

If the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] of  {{math|''L''}} is non-trivial, then the Green's function is not unique. However, in practice, some combination of [[symmetry]], [[boundary condition]]s and/or other externally imposed criteria will give a unique Green's function. 
Green's functions may be categorized, by the type of boundary conditions satisfied, by a [[Green's function number]].
Also, Green's functions in general are [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], not necessarily [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of a real variable.

Green's functions are also useful tools in solving [[wave equation]]s and [[diffusion equation]]s. In [[quantum mechanics]], the Green's function of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is a key concept with important links to the concept of [[density of states]].

As a side note, the Green's function as used in physics is usually defined with the opposite sign, instead,  that is,
:&lt;math&gt;LG(x,s)=\delta(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;
This definition does not significantly change any of the properties of the Green's function.

If the operator is [[translation invariant]], that is, when  {{math|''L''}}   has [[constant coefficients]] with respect to  {{math|''x''}}, then the Green's function can be taken to be a [[convolution operator]], that is,
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,s)=G(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the Green's function is the same as the impulse response of [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system theory]].

==Motivation==
{{See also |Spectral theory}}
Loosely speaking, if such a function {{mvar|G}}  can be found for the operator {{mvar|L}}, then, if we multiply the equation (1) for the Green's function by {{math|''f'' (''s'')}}, and then integrate with respect to {{mvar|s}}, we obtain,
:&lt;math&gt;\int L G(x,s)f(s) \, ds = \int \delta(x-s)f(s) \, ds = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side is now given by the equation (2) to be equal to {{math|''L'' ''u''(''x'')}}, thus
:&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=\int LG(x,s) f(s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the operator &lt;math&gt;L = L(x)&lt;/math&gt; is linear and acts on the variable {{mvar|x}} alone (not on the variable of integration {{mvar|s}}), one may take the operator {{mvar|L}} outside of the integration on the right-hand side, yielding
:&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=L\left(\int G(x,s) f(s) \,ds\right),&lt;/math&gt;
which suggests
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int G(x,s) f(s) \,ds.&lt;/math&gt;|3=(3)|RawN=.}}

Thus, one may obtain the function  {{math| ''u''(''x'')}}  through knowledge of the Green's function in equation (1) and the source term on the right-hand side in equation (2). This process relies upon the linearity of the operator {{mvar|L}}.

In other words, the solution of equation (2),  {{math| ''u''(''x'')}}, can be determined by the integration given in equation (3). Although {{math|''f'' (''x'')}}  is known, this integration cannot be performed unless {{mvar|G}} is also known. The problem now lies in finding the Green's function  {{mvar|G}}  that satisfies equation (1). For this reason, the Green's function is also sometimes called the [[fundamental solution]] associated to the operator  {{mvar|L}}.

Not every operator  {{mvar|L}} admits a Green's function. A Green's function can also be thought of as a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of  {{mvar|L}}.  Aside from the difficulties of finding a Green's function for a particular operator, the integral in equation (3) may be quite difficult to evaluate. However the method gives a theoretically exact result.

This can be thought of as an expansion of  {{mvar|f}}  according to a [[Dirac delta function]] basis (projecting  {{mvar|f}} over {{math| ''δ''(''x−s'')}}); and a superposition of the solution on each [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]. Such an integral equation is known as a [[Fredholm integral equation]], the study of which constitutes [[Fredholm theory]].

==Green's functions for solving inhomogeneous boundary value problems==
The primary use of Green's functions in mathematics is to solve non-homogeneous [[boundary value problem]]s.  In modern [[theoretical physics]], Green's functions are also usually used as [[propagator]]s in [[Feynman diagram]]s;  the term ''Green's function'' is often further used for any [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation function]].

===Framework===
Let {{math|''L''}} be the [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville]] operator, a linear differential operator of the form
:&lt;math&gt;L=\dfrac{d}{dx}\left[p(x) \dfrac{d}{dx}\right]+q(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and let  {{math|''D''}} be the [[boundary condition]]s operator
:&lt;math&gt;Du= \begin{cases}
 \alpha_1 u'(0)+\beta_1 u(0) \\
 \alpha_2 u'(l)+\beta_2 u(l) ~.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Let  {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be a [[continuous function]] in [0, {{math|''l''}}].  Further suppose that the problem
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 Lu &amp;= f \\
 Du &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
is regular, i.e., only the [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] solution exists for the [[homogenization (mathematics)|homogeneous]] problem.

===Theorem===
There is one and only one solution  {{math|''u''(''x'')}} that satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 Lu &amp; = f\\
 Du &amp; = 0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is given by
:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int_0^\ell f(s) G(x,s) \, ds~,&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{math|''G''(''x'',''s'')}} is a Green's function satisfying the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;x \ne s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L G(x, s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;s \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D G(x, s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[Derivative]] "jump": &lt;math&gt;G'(s_{+0}, s)-G'(s_{-0}, s)=1 / p(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Symmetry: &lt;math&gt;G(x,s) = G(s, x)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Advanced and special Green's functions===
{{See also|Green's function (many-body theory)|propagator}}Sometimes the Green's function can be split into a sum of two functions. One with the variable positive (+) and the other with the variable negative (-). These are the advanced and special Green's functions, and when the equation under study depends on time, one of the parts is [[causal]] and the other anti-causal. In these problems usually the causal part is the important one.

==Finding Green's functions==

===Units===
While it doesn't uniquely fix the form the Green's function will take, performing a [[dimensional analysis]] to find the units a Green's function must have is an important sanity check on any Green's function found through other means. A quick examination of the defining equation,
:&lt;math&gt; L G(x, s) = \delta(x - s), &lt;/math&gt;
shows that the units &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; depend not only on the units of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; but also on the number and units of the space of which the position vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are elements. This leads to the relationship:
:&lt;math&gt; [[G]] = [[L]]^{-1} [[\mathrm{d} x]]^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[[G]]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as, "the physical units of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;", and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[volume element]] of the space (or [[spacetime]]).

For example, if &lt;math&gt;L = \partial_t^2&lt;/math&gt; and time is the only variable then: 
:&lt;math&gt;[[L]] = [[\mathrm{time}]]^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[\operatorname{d} x]]  = [[\mathrm{time}]],\ \mathrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[G]] = [[\mathrm{time}]].&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;L = \square = \frac{1}{c^2}\partial_t^2-\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[d'Alembert operator]], and space has 3 dimensions then:
:&lt;math&gt;[[L]] = [[\mathrm{length}]]^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[\operatorname{d} x]] = [[\mathrm{time}]] [[\mathrm{length}]]^3,\ \mathrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[G]] = [[\mathrm{time}]]^{-1} [[\mathrm{length}]]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Eigenvalue expansions===
If a [[differential operator]]  {{math|''L''}} admits a set of [[eigenvectors]]  {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}} (i.e., a set of functions   {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and scalars {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that  {{math|''LΨ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  = {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ) that is complete, then it is possible to construct a Green's function from these eigenvectors and [[eigenvalues]].

"Complete" means that the set of functions { {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} } satisfies the following [[completeness relation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(x-x')=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \Psi_n^\dagger(x) \Psi_n(x').&lt;/math&gt;

Then the following holds,

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;G(x, x')=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \dfrac{\Psi_n^\dagger(x) \Psi_n(x')}{\lambda_n},&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
where &lt;math&gt;\dagger&lt;/math&gt; represents complex conjugation.

Applying the operator  {{math|''L''}} to each side of this equation results in the completeness relation, which was assumed.

The general study of the Green's function written in the above form, and its relationship to the [[function space]]s formed by the eigenvectors, is known as [[Fredholm theory]].

There are several other methods for finding Green's functions, including the [[method of images]], [[separation of variables]], and [[Laplace transforms]] (Cole 2011).

===Combining Green's functions===
If the differential operator &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;L=L_1 L_2&lt;/math&gt; then the Green's function of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from the Green's functions for &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; G(x, s) = \int G_2(x, s_1)\, G_1(s_1, s) \operatorname{d} s_1. &lt;/math&gt;
The above identity follows immediately from taking &lt;math&gt;G(x, s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the representation of the right operator inverse of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, analogous to how for the [[Invertible matrix#Other properties|invertable linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;C= (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, is represented by its matrix elements &lt;math&gt;C_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;.

A further identity follows for differential operators that are scalar polynomials of the derivative, &lt;math&gt;L = P_N(\partial_x)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], combined with the fact that &lt;math&gt;\partial_x&lt;/math&gt; [[Commutative property|commutes with itself]], guarantees that the polynomial can be factored, putting &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the form:
:&lt;math&gt; L = \prod_{i=1}^N (\partial_x - z_i),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; are the zeros of &lt;math&gt;P_N(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;L G(x, s) = \delta(x - s)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; gives:
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{G}(k_x, k_s) = \frac{\delta(k_x - k_s)}{\prod_{i=1}^N (ik_x - z_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;
The fraction can then be split into a sum using a [[Partial fraction decomposition]] before Fourier transforming back to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; space. This process yields identities that relate integrals of Green's functions and sums of the same. For example, if &lt;math&gt;L = (\partial_x + \gamma) (\partial_x + \alpha)^2&lt;/math&gt; then one form for its Green's function is:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}G(x, s) &amp; = \frac{1}{(\alpha - \gamma)^2}\Theta(x-s) \operatorname{e}^{-\gamma(x-s)} - \frac{1}{(\alpha - \gamma)^2}\Theta(x-s) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s)} + \frac{1}{\gamma-\alpha} \Theta(x - s) \, (x - s) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s)} \\
&amp; = \int \Theta(x - s_1) (x - s_1) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s_1)} \Theta(s_1 - s) \operatorname{e}^{-\gamma (s_1 - s)} \operatorname{d} s_1. \end{align}  &lt;/math&gt;
While the example presented is tractable analytically, it illustrates a process that works when the integral is not trivial (for example, when &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; is the operator in the polynomial).

===Table of Green's functions=== 
The following table gives an overview of Green's functions of frequently appearing differential operators, where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[Heaviside step function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle J_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle I_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[modified Bessel function of the first kind]], and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle K_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function#Modified Bessel functions: I.CE.B1 .2C K.CE.B1|modified Bessel function of the second kind]].&lt;ref&gt;some examples taken from Schulz, Hermann: Physik mit Bleistift. Frankfurt am Main: Deutsch, 2001. {{ISBN|3-8171-1661-6}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Where time ({{math|''t''}}) appears in the first column, the advanced (causal) Green's function is listed.

==Green's functions for the Laplacian==
Green's functions for linear differential operators involving the [[Laplacian]] may be readily put to use using the second of [[Green's identities]].

To derive Green's theorem, begin with the [[divergence theorem]] (otherwise known as [[Gauss's theorem]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec A\ dV=\int_S \vec A \cdot d\hat\sigma ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\vec A=\phi\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt; and substitute into Gauss' law.

Compute &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\vec A&lt;/math&gt; and apply the product rule for the ∇ operator,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \nabla\cdot\vec A &amp;=\nabla\cdot(\phi\nabla\psi \;-\; \psi\nabla\phi)\\
 &amp;=(\nabla\phi)\cdot(\nabla\psi) \;+\; \phi\nabla^2\psi \;-\; (\nabla\phi)\cdot(\nabla\psi) \;-\; \psi\nabla^2\phi\\
 &amp;=\phi\nabla^2\psi \;-\; \psi\nabla^2\phi ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the divergence theorem produces [[Green's theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V (\phi\nabla^2\psi-\psi\nabla^2\phi) dV=\int_S (\phi\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\phi)\cdot d\hat\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the linear differential operator {{mvar|L}} is the [[Laplacian]], ∇², and that there is a Green's function {{mvar|G}} for the Laplacian. The defining property of the Green's function still holds,
:&lt;math&gt;L G(x,x')=\nabla^2 G(x,x')=\delta(x-x').&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\psi=G&lt;/math&gt; in Green's second identity, see [[Green's identities]].  Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \left[ \phi(x') \delta(x-x')-G(x,x') {\nabla'}^2\phi(x')\right]\ d^3x' = \int_S \left[\phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')-G(x,x')\nabla'\phi(x')\right] \cdot d\hat\sigma'.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this expression, it is possible to solve [[Laplace's equation]] ∇²''φ(x)'' = 0 or [[Poisson's equation]]  ∇²''φ(x)'' =−''ρ(x)'', subject to either [[Neumann boundary condition|Neumann]] or [[Dirichlet boundary condition|Dirichlet]] boundary conditions. In other words, we can solve for  ''φ(x)'' everywhere inside a volume where either (1) the value of ''φ(x)'' is specified on the bounding surface of the volume (Dirichlet boundary conditions), or (2) the normal derivative of ''φ(x)''  is specified on the bounding surface (Neumann boundary conditions).

Suppose the problem is to solve for ''φ(x)'' inside the region. Then the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_V {\phi(x')\delta(x-x')\ d^3x'}&lt;/math&gt;
reduces to simply ''φ(x)'' due to the defining property of the [[Dirac delta function]] and we have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=-\int_V G(x,x') \rho(x')\ d^3x'+\int_S \left[\phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')-G(x,x')\nabla'\phi(x')\right] \cdot d\hat\sigma'.&lt;/math&gt;

This form expresses the well-known property of [[harmonic function]]s, that ''if the value or normal derivative is known on a bounding surface, then the value of the function inside the volume is known everywhere''.

In [[electrostatics]],  ''φ(x)'' is interpreted as the [[electric potential]],  ''ρ(x)'' as [[electric charge]] [[density]], and the normal derivative &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi(x')\cdot d\hat\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; as the normal component of the electric field.

If the problem is to solve a Dirichlet boundary value problem, the Green's function should be chosen such that ''G(x,x')''  vanishes when either ''x'' or ''x''′ is on the bounding surface. Thus only one of the two terms in the surface integral remains. If the problem is to solve a Neumann boundary value problem, the Green's function is chosen such that its normal derivative vanishes on the bounding surface, as it would seem to be the most logical choice. (See Jackson J.D. classical electrodynamics, page 39).  However, application of Gauss's theorem to the differential equation defining the Green's function yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \nabla' G(x,x') \cdot d\hat\sigma' = \int_V \nabla'^2 G(x,x') d^3x' = \int_V \delta (x-x') d^3x' = 1   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
meaning the normal derivative of ''G(x,x')''  cannot vanish on the surface, because it must integrate to 1 on the surface.  (Again, see Jackson J.D. classical electrodynamics, page 39 for this and the following argument).

The simplest form the normal derivative can take is that of a constant, namely 1/''S'', where ''S'' is the surface area of the surface.  
The surface term in the solution becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')\cdot d\hat\sigma' = \langle\phi\rangle_S &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi\rangle_S &lt;/math&gt; is the average value of the potential on the surface.  This number is not known in general, but is often unimportant, as the goal is often to obtain the electric field given by the gradient of the potential, rather than the potential itself.

With no boundary conditions, the Green's function for the Laplacian ([[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation]]) is
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,x')=-\dfrac{1}{4 \pi |x-x'|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Supposing that the bounding surface goes out to infinity and plugging in this expression for the Green's function  finally yields the standard expression for electric potential in terms of electric charge density as

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=\int_V \dfrac{\rho(x')}{4 \pi \varepsilon |x-x'|} \, d^3x' ~.&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example.''' Find the Green function for the following problem, whose [[Green's function number]] is X11:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Lu &amp; = u'' + k^2 u = f(x)\\
  u(0)&amp; = 0, \quad u\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2k}\right) = 0.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''First step:''' The Green's function for the linear operator at hand is defined as the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;g''(x,s) + k^2 g(x,s) = \delta(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x\ne s&lt;/math&gt;, then the delta function gives zero, and the general solution is

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)=c_1 \cos kx+c_2 \sin kx.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;g(0,s)=c_1 \cdot 1+c_2 \cdot 0=0, \quad c_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

 if &lt;math&gt;x &lt; s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s \ne \tfrac{\pi}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;x&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;x=\tfrac{\pi}{2k}&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;g\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2k},s\right) = c_3 \cdot 0+c_4 \cdot 1=0, \quad c_4 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of &lt;math&gt;g(0,s)=0&lt;/math&gt; is skipped for similar reasons.

To summarize the results thus far:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)= \begin{cases}
  c_2 \sin kx, &amp; \text{for }x&lt;s\\
  c_3 \cos kx, &amp; \text{for }s&lt;x
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Second step:''' The next task is to determine &lt;math&gt;c_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Ensuring continuity in the Green's function at &lt;math&gt;x=s&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;c_2 \sin ks=c_3 \cos ks&lt;/math&gt;

One can ensure proper discontinuity in the first derivative by integrating the defining differential equation from &lt;math&gt;x=s-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=s+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;c_3 \cdot \left(-k \sin ks\right)-c_2 \cdot \left( k \cos ks\right )=1&lt;/math&gt;

The two (dis)continuity equations can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{3}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;c_2 = -\frac{\cos ks}{k}  \quad;\quad c_3 = -\frac{\sin ks}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

So the Green's function for this problem is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)=\begin{cases}
  -\frac{\cos ks}{k} \sin kx, &amp; x&lt;s\\
  -\frac{\sin ks}{k} \cos kx, &amp; s&lt;x
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Further examples==
* Let {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and let the subset be all of ℝ. Let  {{mvar|L}} be &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}}/{\operatorname{d} x}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the [[Heaviside step function]] {{mvar|H}}({{mvar|x}}−{{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Green's function of  {{mvar|L}} at {{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Let  {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and let the subset be the quarter-plane {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{{math|(''x'', ''y'') : ''x'', ''y''}} ≥ 0} and  {{mvar|L}} be the [[Laplacian]]. Also, assume a [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] is imposed at  {{mvar|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and a [[Neumann boundary condition]] is imposed at  {{mvar|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Then the X10Y20 Green's function is

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G(x, y, x_0, y_0) =\dfrac{1}{2\pi} &amp;\left[\ln\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}-\ln\sqrt{(x+x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2} \right. \\
&amp;\left. + \ln\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y+y_0)^2}- \ln\sqrt{(x+x_0)^2+(y+y_0)^2}\right]
\end{align}    ~.&lt;/math&gt;

* Let &lt;math&gt; a &lt; x &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;, and all three are elements of the real numbers. Then, for any function from reals to reals, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative that is integrable over the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \frac{(x - a)^m}{m!} \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^m f}{\operatorname{d} x^m} \right]_{x=a} + \int_a^b \left[\frac{(x - s)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \Theta(x - s)\right] \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^n f}{\operatorname{d} x^n} \right]_{x=s} \operatorname{d}s 
\end{align} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

: The Green's function in the above equation, &lt;math&gt;G(x,s) = \frac{(x - s)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \Theta(x - s)&lt;/math&gt;, is not unique. How is the equation modified if &lt;math&gt;g(x-s)&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}^n g}{\operatorname{d} x^n} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt; (for example, &lt;math&gt;g(x) = -x/2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;)? Also, compare the above equation to the form of a [[Taylor series]] centered at &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;.

Publicized accusations of greenwashing have contributed to the term's increasing use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seele|first1=Peter|last2=Gatti|first2=Lucia|title=Greenwashing Revisited: In Search of a Typology and Accusation-Based Definition Incorporating Legitimacy Strategies|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment |date=2015 |doi=10.1002/bse.1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While greenwashing is not new, its use has increased over recent years to meet consumer demand for [[environmentally friendly]] goods and services. The problem is compounded by lax enforcement by regulatory agencies such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in the United States, the [[Competition Bureau]] in Canada, and the [[Committee of Advertising Practice]] and the [[Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice]] in the United Kingdom. Critics of the practice suggest that the rise of greenwashing, paired with ineffective regulation, contributes to consumer skepticism of all green claims, and diminishes the power of the consumer in driving companies toward greener solutions for manufacturing processes and business operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahl |first=Richard |title=Greenwashing: Do You Know What You're Buying? |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=1 June 2010 |volume=118 |issue=6 |pages=a246–a252 |doi=10.1289/ehp.118-a246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporate structures use greenwashing as a way to repair public perception of their brand. The structuring of corporate disclosure is often set up so as to maximize perceptions of legitimacy. However, a growing body of social and environmental accounting research finds that, in the absence of external monitoring a verification, greenwashing strategies amount to corporate posturing and deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laufer |first=William S. |title=Social Accountability and Corporate Greenwashing |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=2003 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=253–261 |doi=10.1023/A:1022962719299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The term ''greenwashing'' was coined by [[New York City|New York]] [[environmentalist]] [[Jay Westervelt]] in a 1986 essay regarding the [[hospitality industry|hotel industry]]'s practice of placing placards in each room promoting reuse of towels ostensibly to "save the environment." Westervelt noted that, in most cases, little or no effort toward reducing energy waste was being made by these institutions—as evidenced by the lack of cost reduction this practice effected. Westervelt opined that the actual objective of this "green campaign" on the part of many hoteliers was, in fact, increased profit. Westervelt thus labeled this and other outwardly environmentally conscientious acts with a greater, underlying purpose of profit increase as ''greenwashing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/12/the-history-of-greenwashing-how-dirty-towels-impacted-the-green/ |title=A History of Greenwashing: How Dirty Towels Impacted the Green Movement |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |date=2011-02-12 |work=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=Greenwashers invade the market |language=Danish |title=Grønvaskere invaderer børsen |url=http://epn.dk/privatokonomi/investering/article1374993.ece |work=EPN.dk |publisher=Jyllands-Posten |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2012-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705195538/http://epn.dk/privatokonomi/investering/article1374993.ece |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/special-report/09/16/08/beware-green-marketing-warns-greenpeace-exec |title=Beware of green marketing, warns Greenpeace exec |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205171221/http://www.lodgingmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=FD212DB2AA944808BF5CE6519B2BCC06 |archivedate=2009-02-05 |date=2009-02-01 |url=http://www.lodgingmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=FD212DB2AA944808BF5CE6519B2BCC06 |title=The Real Deal?

In addition, the political term "linguistic detoxification" describes when, through [[legislation]] or other [[government]] action, the definitions of [[toxicity]] for certain substances are changed, or the name of the substance is changed, so that fewer things fall under a particular classification as toxic. The origin of this phrase has been attributed to environmental activist and author [[Barry Commoner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Commoner |first=Barry |title=After 20 Years: The Crisis of Environmental Regulation |journal=New Solutions |year=1990 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=22–29 |doi=10.2190/ns1.1.g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, introduction of a [[Carbon emission trading|Carbon Emission Trading Scheme]] may feel good, but may be counterproductive if the cost of carbon is priced too low, or if large emitters are given "free credits." For example, [[Bank of America]] subsidiary [[MBNA]] offers an Eco-Logique [[MasterCard]] for Canadian consumers that rewards customers with [[carbon offsets]] as they continue using the card. Customers may feel that they are nullifying their [[carbon footprint]] by purchasing polluting goods with the card. However, only 0.5 percent of purchase price goes into purchasing carbon offsets, while the rest of the [[interchange fee]] still goes to the bank.&lt;ref name=CashingIn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/enerclick/january-2008/cashing-environmental-cow |title=Cashing in on the Environmental |publisher=Climate Change Central |date=2009-11-13 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222626/http://www.climatechangecentral.com/publications/enerclick/january-2008/cashing-environmental-cow |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such campaigns and [[marketing communications]], designed to publicize and highlight organizational CSR policies to various stakeholders, affect corporate reputation and brand image, but the proliferation of unsubstantiated ethical claims and greenwashing by some companies has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahdi |first1=Khosro S. |last2=Acikdilli |first2=Gaye |title=Marketing Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Marriage of Convenience or Shotgun Wedding? |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=August 2009 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=103–113 |doi=10.1007/s10551-009-0113-1 |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0113-1?LI=true |issn=0167-4544 |language=en |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid 1960s, the environmental movement gained momentum. This popularity prompted many companies to create a new green image through advertising. [[Jerry Mander]], a former [[Madison Avenue]] advertising executive, called this new form of advertising "ecopornography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Brian|title=Great Debates in American Environmental History|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport|isbn=0-313-33930-9|editor-last=Lybecker |editor-first=Donna L. |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Earth Day]] was held on April 22, 1970. This encouraged many industries to advertise themselves as being friendly to the environment. Public utilities spent 300 million dollars advertising themselves as clean green companies. This was eight times more than the money they spent on pollution reduction research.&lt;ref name="tglo"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://thegreenlifeonline.org/greenwash101/ |title=Greenwashing 101 - The Green Life |website=Thegreenlifeonline.org |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=242 |title=CorpWatch : Greenwash Fact Sheet |website=Corpwatch.org |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[Chevron Corporation]] launched one of the most famous greenwashing ad campaigns in history. Chevron's "People Do" advertisements were aimed at a "hostile audience" of "societally conscious" people. Two years after the launch of the campaign, surveys found people in California trusted Chevron more than other oil companies to protect the environment. In the late 1980s The [[American Chemistry Council]] started a program called [[Responsible Care]], which shone light on the environmental performances and precautions of the group's members. The loose guidelines of responsible care caused industries to adopt self-regulation over government regulation.&lt;ref name=tglo/&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

In 1991, a study published in the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing ([[American Marketing Association]]) found that 58% of environmental ads had at least one deceptive claim. Another study found that 77% of people said the environmental reputation of company affected whether they would buy their products. One fourth of all household products marketed around Earth Day advertised themselves as being green and environmentally friendly. In 1998 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] created the "Green Guidelines," which defined terms used in environmental marketing. The following year the FTC found that the Nuclear Energy Institute claims of being environmentally clean were not true. The FTC did nothing about the ads because they were out of their jurisdiction. This caused the FTC to realize they needed new clear enforceable standards. In 1999, according to environmental activist organizations, the word "greenwashing" was added to the ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=tglo/&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

In 2002, during the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg, the Greenwashing Academy hosted the Greenwash Academy Awards. The ceremony awarded companies like [[BP]], [[ExxonMobil]], and even the [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] for their elaborate greenwashing ads and support for greenwashing.&lt;ref name=tglo/&gt;&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

More recently, social scientists have been investigating claims of and the impact of greenwashing. In 2005, Ramus and Monteil conducted secondary data analysis of two databases to uncover corporate commitment to implementation of environmental policies as opposed to greenwashing. They found while companies in the [[petroleum industry|oil]] and gas are more likely to implement environmental policies than [[service industry]] companies, they are less likely to commit to [[fossil fuel]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramus |first=Catherine A. |last2=Montiel |first2=Ivan |title=When Are Corporate Environmental Policies a Form of Greenwashing? |journal=Business &amp; Society |date=July 26, 2016 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=377–414 |doi=10.1177/0007650305278120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a study was done showing that 4.5% of products tested were found to be truly green as opposed to 2% in 2009. In 2009 2,739 products claimed to be green while in 2010 the number rose to 4,744. The same study in 2010 found that 95% percent of the consumer products claiming to be green were not green at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sinsofgreenwashing.com |author=Terra Choice Group |title=The Sins of Greenwashing Home and Family |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==

===Australia===
The Australian [[Trade Practices Act]] has been modified to include punishment of companies that provide misleading environmental claims. Any organization found guilty of such could face up $6 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/12/16/nurofen-fine-misleading-claims-australia-increased-35-million/ |title=Nurofen fine over misleading claims in Australia increased to £3.5 million |agency=France Presse Agence |date=16 December 2016 |newspaper=Telegraph |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fines. In addition, the guilty party must pay for all expenses incurred while setting the record straight about their product or company's actual [[environmental impact]].&lt;ref name=Naish&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naish |first=J. |year=2008 |title=Lies...Damned lies...And green lies |journal=Ecologist |volume=38 |issue= 5 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Canada's [[Competition Bureau]] along with the [[Canadian Standards Association]] are discouraging companies from making "vague claims" towards their products' environmental impact. Any claims must be backed up by "readily available data."&lt;ref name=Naish/&gt;

===Norway===
[[Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman|Norway's consumer ombudsman]] has targeted automakers who claim that their cars are "green," "clean" or "environmentally friendly" with some of the world's strictest advertising guidelines. Consumer Ombudsman official Bente Øverli said: "Cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others." Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words. Øverli said she did not know of other countries going so far in cracking down on cars and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbrukerombudet.no/asset/2857/1/2857_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101123183503/http://forbrukerombudet.no/asset/2857/1/2857_1.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4028677 |title=Prove 'clean, green' ads, Norway tells automakers |publisher=Motoring.co.za |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/09/norway_says_car.php |title=Greenwash Watch: Norways Says Cars Neither Green Nor Clean |publisher=Treehugger.com |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL0671323420070906 |title=Norways Says Cars Neither Green Nor Clean |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-11 | first=Alister |last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.===
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) provides voluntary guidelines for environmental marketing claims. These guidelines give the FTC the right to prosecute false and misleading advertisement claims. The green guidelines were not created to be used as an enforceable guideline but instead were intended to be followed voluntarily. Listed below are the green guidelines set by the FTC.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Qualifications and disclosures: The Commission traditionally has held that in order to be effective, any qualifications or disclosures such as those described in these guides should be sufficiently clear, prominent and understandable to prevent deception. Clarity of language, relative type size and proximity to the claim being qualified, and an absence of contrary claims that could undercut effectiveness, will maximize the likelihood that the qualifications and disclosures are appropriately clear and prominent.&lt;ref name=gft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117145015/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm |archivedate=November 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Distinction between benefits of product, package and service: An environmental marketing claim should be presented in a way that makes clear whether the environmental attribute or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product's [[packaging]], a service or to a portion or component of the product, package or service. In general, if the environmental attribute or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified "[[recyclable]]" claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.&lt;ref name=gft/&gt;
*Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the environmental attribute or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is in fact negligible.&lt;ref name=gft/&gt;
*Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a comparative statement should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.&lt;ref name=gft/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The FTC has said in 2010 that it will update its guidelines for environmental marketing claims in an attempt to reduce greenwashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencleancertified.com/green-cleaning-health/green-watch/FTC-Reviews-Guidelines-for-Green-Claims/ |title=FTC Reviews Guidelines for Green Claims |website=Greencleancertified.com |date=2016-06-15 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revision to the FTC's Green Guides covers a wide range of public input, including hundreds of consumer and industry comments on previously proposed revisions. The updates and revision to the existing Guides include a new section of carbon offsets, "green" certifications and seals renewable energy and renewable materials claims. According to FTC Chairman [[Jon Leibowitz]], "The introduction of environmentally friendly products into the marketplace is a win for consumers who want to purchase greener products and producers who wants to sell them." Leibowitz also says the win-win can only claim if marketers' claims are straightforward and proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/greenguides.shtm |title=FTC Issues Revised "Green Guides"  |website=US Federal Trade Commission |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the FTC began enforcing the revisions put forth in the Green Guides. The FTC cracked down on six different companies, in which five of the cases were concerned with the false or misleading advertising surrounding the biodegradability of plastics. The FTC charged ECM Biofilms, American Plastic Manufacturing, CHAMP, Clear Choice Housewares, and Carnie Cap, for misrepresenting the biodegradability of their plastics treated with additives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/communications/jennifer-elks/ftc-cracking-down-misleading-unsubstantiated-biodegradab|title=FTC Cracking Down on Misleading, Unsubstantiated Biodegradability Claims|website=Sustainable Brands|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC charged a sixth company, AJM Packaging Corporation, for violating a commission consent order put in place that prohibits companies from using advertising claims based on the product or packaging being "degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable" without reliable scientific information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The FTC now requires companies to disclose and provide the information that qualifies their environmental claims to ensure transparency.

*The conversion of the term "Tar Sands" to "Oil Sands," (Alberta, Canada) in corporate and political language reflects an ongoing debate between the project's adherents and opponents. This semantic shift can be seen as a case of greenwashing in an attempt at countering growing public concern as to the environmental and health impacts of the industry. While advocates claim that the shift is scientifically derived to better reflect the usage of the sands as a precursor to oil, environmental groups are claiming that this is simply a means of cloaking the issue behind friendlier terminology.
*Over the past years [[Walmart]] has proclaimed to "go green" with a sustainability campaign. However, according to the Institute For Local Reliance (ILRS), “Walmart’s sustainability campaign has done more to improve the company’s image than the environment.” Walmart still only generates 2 percent of U.S. electricity from wind and solar resources. According to the ILRS, Walmart routinely donates money to political candidates who vote against the environment. The retail giant responded to these accusations by stating "that it is serious about its commitment to reduce 20 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ilsr.org/top-10-ways-walmart-fails-sustainability/ |title=Top 10 Ways Walmart Fails on Sustainability &amp;#124; Institute for Local Self-Reliance |website=Ilsr.org |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Environmental accounting]] can easily be used to pretend that environmental impacts of a company are reduced while actual impacts increase. This has been shown, for example, in a case of corporate carbon accounting: the company celebrated reduced relative emissions while absolute emissions increased. The same company achieved reducing current emissions by "correcting" past emissions as higher (effecting a calculation that presents current emissions as relatively lower).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:384-opus4-21997 |title=OPUS 4 &amp;#124; Enacting Environments: An Ethnography of the Digitalisation and Naturalisation of Emissions |website=Nbn-resolving.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2018, in response to increased calls for banning plastic straws, [[Starbucks]] introduced a new straw-less lid that actually contained more plastic by weight than the old straw and lid combination. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/07/12/starbucks-straw-ban-will-see-the-company|title=Starbucks Bans Plastic Straws, Winds Up Using More Plastic|date=2018-07-12|work=Reason.com|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Organizations and individuals are making attempts to reduce the impact of greenwashing by exposing it to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=106166&amp;catId=100583&amp;tid=100008 |title=Green Watch |publisher=choice.com.au |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenwashing Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/ |title=Greenwashing Index |publisher=Greenwashing Index |date=|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the [[University of Oregon]] in partnership with EnviroMedia Social Marketing, allows examples of greenwashing to be uploaded and rated by the public.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopgreenwash.org/ |title=Greenpeace &amp;#124; Greenwashing |website=Stopgreenwash.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Code of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing has a specific section (section 49) targeting environmental claims.

According to some organizations opposing greenwashing, there has been a significant increase in its use by companies over the last decade{{When|date=July 2017}}. TerraChoice Environmental Marketing, an advertising consultancy company, issued a report denoting a 79% increase in the usage of corporate greenwashing between 2007 and 2009. Additionally, it has begun to manifest itself in new varied ways. Within the non-residential building products market in the United States, some companies are beginning to claim that their environmentally minded policy changes will allow them to earn points through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating program. This point system has been held up as an example of the "gateway effect" that the drive to market products as environmentally friendly is having on company policies. Some have claimed that the greenwashing trend may be enough to eventually effect a genuine reduction in environmentally damaging practices. 

According to the Home and Family Edition, 95% consumer products claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of the "Sins of Greenwashing". The Seven Sins of Greenwashing are as follows:
# Sin of the Hidden Trade-off, committed by suggesting a product is "green" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other important environmental issues.
# Sin of No Proof, committed by an environmental claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible supporting information or by a reliable third-party certification. 
# Sin of [[Vagueness]], committed by every claim that is so poorly defined or broad that its real meaning is likely to be misunderstood by the consumer.
# Sin of Worshiping False Labels is committed when a claim, communicated either through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party [[testimonial|endorsement]] where no such endorsement exists. 
# Sin of [[Irrelevance]], committed by making an environmental claim that may be truthful but which is unimportant or unhelpful for consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.
# Sin of Lesser of Two Evils, committed by claims that may be true within the product category, but that risk distracting consumers from the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole.
# Sin of [[Fibbing]], the least frequent Sin, is committed by making environmental claims that are simply false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/ |title=Home and Family Edition |publisher=The Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ed Gillespie identified "ten signs of greenwashing", which are similar to the ''Seven Sins'' listed above, but with three additional indicators.
# Suggestive pictures - Images that imply a baseless green impact, such as flowers issuing from the exhaust pipe of a vehicle.
# Just not credible - A claim that touts the [[environmentally friendly]] attributes of a dangerous product, such as cigarettes.
# Gobbledygook - The use of [[jargon]] or information that the average person can not readily understand or be able to verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillespie |first=Ed |title=Stemming the tide of 'greenwash' |journal=Consumer Policy Review |date=May 2008 |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=79 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32818374/stemming-tide-greenwash |via=ebscohost |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies may pursue [[environmental certification]] to avoid greenwashing through independent verification of their green claims. For example, the [[Carbon Trust]] Standard launched in 2007 with the stated aim "to end 'greenwash' and highlight firms that are genuine about their commitment to the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/24/carbonemissions.carbonfootprints |title=Carbon Trust aims to end 'greenwash' by launching company standard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term is derived from the English{{efn|Some of this information originated in a Dutch Wiki article, translated to English, then supplemented by other sources.}} word "horn" and refers to the [[Sign of the horns|devil's horns]]. This is in contrast to the word halo and the [[halo effect]], based on the concept of a [[Halo (religious iconography)|saint's halo]].

In a 1920 study published by Thorndike&lt;ref name=ThornD&gt;{{Citation | last = Thorndike | first = EL 
| title= A constant error in psychological ratings
| journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | year= 1920|volume=4|issue=1
|pages=25–29|doi= 10.1037/h0071663}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the halo effect, it was noted that "ratings were apparently affected by a marked tendency to think of the person in general as rather good or rather inferior {{efn|(SIC,inFerior)}} and to color the judgments of the qualities by this general feeling".{{efn|Although not popularizing the actual term Horn effect.}}

===Alternate terminology===
It is sometimes called the ''horns effect'',&lt;ref name=Attitudes/&gt; ''reverse-halo effect'', or ''devil effect''.

==Bias in action==
The horn effect occurs when "individuals believe that negative traits are connected to each other."&lt;ref name=JoshKennon/&gt; It is a phenomenon in which an observer's judgment of a person is adversely affected by the presence of (for the observer) an unfavorable aspect of this person.
* ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote of the devil effect in relation to [[Hugo Chavez]]: "Some leaders can become so demonized that it's impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Glennie|first=Jonathan
|title=Hugo Chávez's reverse-halo effect|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/03/hugo-chavez-reverso-halo-effect |newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The relation of crime to attractiveness is also subject to the halo effect. A study presented two hypothetical crimes: a [[burglary]] and a [[confidence trick|swindle]]. The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200; the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation.  The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness (as in the burglary) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one. However, when the offense was related to attractiveness (the swindle), the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one.  The study imputes that the usual leniency given to the attractive woman (as a result of the halo effect) was negated or reversed when the nature of the crime involved her looks.&lt;ref name = "ostrove_sigall1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrove|first1 =Nancy| last2 =Sigall | first2 = Harold|title = Beautiful but Dangerous: Effects of Offender Attractiveness and Nature of the Crime on Juridic Judgment | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1975|volume=31|issue=3|pages=410–14

{{Primary sources|date=December 2017}}
'''Inherence''' refers to [[Empedocles|Empedocles']] idea that the [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] of [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] come from the relative [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] of each of the [[Classical element|four elements]] entering into a thing.  The idea was further developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].

==Overview==
That Plato accepted (or at least did not reject) Empedocles' claim can be seen in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.  However, Plato also applied it to cover the presence of [[Theory of forms|form]] in matter.  The form is an active principle.  Matter, on the other hand is passive, being a mere [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] that the forms bring to life.

Aristotle clearly accepted Empedocles' claim,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061216164725/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/corruption/ ''On the Generation and Corruption''].&lt;/ref&gt; but he rejected Plato's idea of the forms.  According to Aristotle, the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]] of a [[Substance theory|substance]] are [[incorporeal]] [[beings]] which are present in it.&lt;ref&gt;"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject." (Aristotle, ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' 1a24–26).&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is [[Participation (philosophy)|participation]].  If an attribute ''inheres'' in a subject, then the subject is said to ''participate'' in the attribute.  For example, if the attribute ''in Athens'' inheres in Socrates, then Socrates is said to participate in the attribute, ''in Athens.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">In [[ring theory]], a subfield of [[abstract algebra]], a '''right Kasch ring''' is a ring ''R'' for which every [[simple module|simple]] right ''R'' [[module (mathematics)|module]] is isomorphic to a [[right ideal]] of ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;This ideal is necessarily a [[minimal right ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously the notion of a '''left Kasch ring''' is defined, and the two properties are independent of each other.

Kasch rings are named in honor of mathematician [[Friedrich Kasch]]. Kasch originally called [[Artinian ring]]s whose proper [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s have nonzero [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s ''S-rings''. {{harv|Kasch|1954}}{{harv|Morita|1966}} The characterizations below show that Kasch rings generalize S-rings.

==Definition==
Equivalent definitions will be introduced only for the right-hand version, with the understanding that the left-hand analogues are also true. The Kasch conditions have a few equivalent statements using the concept of [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s, and this article uses the same notation appearing in the annihilator article.

In addition to the definition given in the introduction, the following properties are equivalent definitions for a ring ''R'' to be right Kasch. They appear in {{harv|Lam|1999|loc=p. 281}}:
# For every simple right ''R'' module ''S'', there is a nonzero module [[homomorphism]] from ''M'' into ''R''.

*Let ''R'' be a [[semiprimary ring]] with [[Jacobson radical]] ''J''. If ''R'' is commutative, or if ''R''/''J'' is a [[simple ring]], then ''R'' is right (and left) Kasch. In particular, commutative [[Artinian ring]]s are right and left Kasch.
* For a division ring ''k'', consider a certain subring ''R'' of the four-by-four matrix ring with entries from ''k''. The subring ''R'' consists of matrices of the following form:
:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; 0 &amp; b &amp; c \\
0 &amp; a &amp; 0 &amp; d \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; a &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; e \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:This is a right and left Artinian ring which is right Kasch, but ''not'' left Kasch.
* Let ''S'' be the ring of [[power series]] on two noncommuting variables ''X'' and ''Y'' with coefficients from a field ''F''. Let the ideal ''A'' be the ideal generated by the two elements ''YX'' and ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[quotient ring]] ''S''/''A'' is a [[local ring]] which is right Kasch but ''not'' left Kasch.
* Suppose ''R'' is a ring [[direct product]] of infinitely many nonzero rings labeled ''A''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[direct sum]] of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; forms a proper ideal of ''R''. It is easily checked that the left and right annihilators of this ideal are zero, and so ''R'' is not right or left Kasch.
* The two-by-two upper (or lower) [[triangular matrix ring]] is not right or left Kasch.
* A ring with right [[Socle (mathematics)#Socle of a module|socle]] zero (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{soc}(R_R)=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;) cannot be right Kasch, since the ring contains no [[minimal ideal|minimal right ideal]]s. So, for example, [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]s which are not [[division ring]]s are not right or left Kasch.

'''Kliper''' ('''Клипер''', [[English language|English]]: '''Clipper''') was an early-2000s proposed partly- &lt;!--orbital section and probably thermal protection shield are not reusable--&gt;[[Reusable launch system|reusable]] manned [[spacecraft]] concept by [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]]. Due to lack of funding from the ESA and RSA, the project was indefinitely postponed by 2006.

Designed primarily to replace the [[Soyuz spacecraft]], Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure [[lifting body]] design and as [[spaceplane]] with small [[wing]]s. In either case, the craft would have been able to glide into the atmosphere at an angle that produces much less stress on the human occupants than the current Soyuz. Kliper was intended to be designed to be able to carry up to six people and to perform ferry services between Earth and the [[International Space Station]].

==Development==

===Announcement of the program===
[[File:Soyuz TMA-6 spacecraft.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Soyuz TMA-6]] spacecraft approaching the International Space Station - the Soyuz spacecraft would have been replaced by Kliper]]
In February 2004 Nikolai Moiseyev, the deputy director of [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (FSA) told journalists that the Kliper project had been included in the Russian federal space program for 2005-15. At that point he announced that if the program is implemented successfully the first launch may even take place in five years' time. Kliper had been developed since 2000 and reportedly relied heavily on research studies as well as proposals for a small Russian [[lifting body]] spacecraft from the 1990s. Externally its design was comparable to the cancelled European minishuttle [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] or the [[NASA]] study [[X-38]]. It was planned to be the successor to the veteran spacecraft Soyuz, which has been built in various modifications since 1961.

===Early search for support===
In 2005 Kliper was displayed in several [[airshow|air show]]s around Europe and Asia, in order to reach out to international partners who would be interested to co-fund and co-develop the spacecraft. The [[Russian Space Agency]] especially looked to Europe as the European Space Agency ([[ESA]]) had become its major partner in space activities during the last years. In May 2005 rumours started in the press that Europe would join the Kliper project in a specially funded venture that would be part of the [[Aurora Programme]]. These rumours turned out to be correct when both Russian and European space officials announced their cooperation to build Kliper during the [[Paris Air Show]] in [[Le Bourget]] on June 10, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news4524.html|title=ESA to join Russia's Kliper program|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4286086.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Plans for Euro-Russian spaceplane|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Taneev, the leading designer of the Kliper system, speculated on the contribution of Europe to the project in the following way:{{when|date=October 2016}}
:The European companies will likely contribute avionics, materials, and cabin systems. Many different options are on the table, and in the near future we expect to form Russian-European working groups specialized in different subsystems and fields of design.

The Russian Space Agency as well as ESA announced{{when|date=October 2016}} that they would continue to look for other international partners such as [[Japan]] to invest in Kliper. A substantive cooperation with NASA was unlikely, due to the parallel development of America's own next-generation manned launch vehicle, the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV).{{cn|date=October 2016}}

A further element of this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press agencies revealed that [[JAXA]], the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia to participate in the project. [[JAXA]] has made it clear that they are more likely to join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005.{{cn|date=October 2016}} The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===Estimated costs===
Announcements and speculations following the February 2004 press conference suggested a development budget of {{currency|10 billion|RUB}}  (about {{currency|400 million|USD}}). However, in looking at today's costs for human space travel it was clear that the 10 billion rubles figure was a rather low estimate. In May 2005 [[The Guardian]] reported that costs are estimated to be roughly {{currency|3 billion|USD}} (for development and construction of Kliper until 2015) of which the bulk of {{currency|1.8 billion|USD}} was speculated to come from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/space/article/0,14493,1489679,00.html|title=Europe to hitch space ride on Russia's rocket|author=Robin McKie|work=the Guardian|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different sources in 2005 have reported that the money needed for the program would be {{currency|1.5 billion|euro}} (about {{currency|1.8 billion|USD}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1649104,00.html|title=Europeans Take on NASA|work=DW.COM|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 12, 2005 an article stated it would be {{currency|1 billion|euro}} (solely in relation to development costs).&lt;ref name="DWeurope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1812755,00.html|title=Europe Keen to Join Russia in New Spaceship Project|work=DW.COM|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2005 the Russian government approved the national space program for 2006 to 2015 with a budget of {{currency|305 billion|RUB}} (about {{currency|11 billion|USD}}). The whole budget for the 10-year period was to have been {{currency|425 billion|RUB}} (about {{currency|15 billion|USD}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/07/15/afx2141304.html |date=15 July 2005 | work=Forbes | title=Russian govt agrees 12.5 bln eur 10-yr space programme |archivedate=1 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501124334/http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/07/15/afx2141304.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget included the needed funding for the Kliper program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbcnews.com/free/20050714122650.shtml|title=RosBusinessConsulting - News Online|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in face of Europe's denial to fund a {{currency|50 million|euro}} feasibility study for the Kliper project at the European space summit in December 2005, Russian space officials have announced that Russia would fund Kliper even without any European contribution.&lt;ref name="DWeurope" /&gt;

The most recent article on Kliper stated that the project would have incurred {{currency|16 billion|RUB}} (about {{currency|600 million|USD}}) in development costs, {{currency|11 billion|RUB}} of which will be financed by the government and {{currency|5 billion|RUB}} by contractors.&lt;ref name="notflightglobal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2006/02/14/Navigation/177/204620/Kliper+choice+delayed.html |title=Flight International: Kliper choice delayed |access-date=27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First launch and target for regular flights===
In 2004 it was announced that it was likely that Kliper would make its first launch as early as 2010 or 2011, the same time the [[Space Shuttle]] was scheduled to be retired.  However, it was reported by [[BBC]] News on September 27, 2005, that the first flight tests were not planned until 2011, with the first manned flights in 2012 and the [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] being phased out over time until 2014. An article on December 3, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20051202/42288677.html|title=Russian technologies can put cosmonauts on Moon|author=Sputnik|date=2 December 2005|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited the president of the [[NPO Energia|Energia]] Rocket and Space Corporation [[Nikolai Sevastyanov]] that "the first regular lift-off is scheduled for 2012, while a complete transport system will be in place by 2015." After the termination of the Russian Space Agency's tender for a new spacecraft, Energia announced that this would push its Kliper proposal's first flight&amp;nbsp;— if developed at all&amp;nbsp;— back further.  In the event, the development project did not continue.

===ESA's part in Kliper — uncertainty over European cooperation===
[[File:International Space Station after undocking of STS-132.jpg|Kliper was planned to be Russia's and even Europe's primary access route to the [[International Space Station]]|300px|right|thumb]]

On September 28, 2005 the [[BBC News|BBC]] reported that Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's Human Spaceflight Development Department, stated that Kliper would be used: "For future exploration, when we have the objective of going to the Moon, it is important to have several possibilities to go there, and within this framework of cooperation to have our own access to orbit around the Moon."  In the same context, Alain Fournier-Sicre, head of the ESA permanent mission in the Russian Federation, also stated that: "The objective is to have a vehicle which is more comfortable than the Soyuz capsule which will be used with pilots and four passengers…  It is meant to service the space station and to go between Earth and an orbit around the Moon with six crew members."

Although there seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm for Kliper within Alan Thirkettle’s team at ESA (as outlined in the above paragraph), on December 7, 2005, the European space summit of governmental officials of ESA member states declined to approve a 50-million-euro two-year study focusing on ESA's potential involvement in the Kliper project. In denying funding for the study ESA members stated that, among other factors that seemed unfavourable, under the current Russian proposal Europe would not share control over the design of the program and would be limited to being a small industrial contributor.

[[Jean-Jacques Dordain]], ESA's Director General, put the refusal to fund the study into context: "It is not a question of member states for and member states against.  I think the decision could not be taken for reasons that are not linked to Clipper itself.  The decision could not be taken because of budgetary restraints."  Dordain concluded that he was convinced that European support for Kliper was vital for ESA's future involvement in space transport and that a favourable decision can be achieved until June 2006. In concluding "We need two transportation systems in the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051205/full/051205-7.html |publisher=Nature |title=Europe unites over space budget |date=12 May 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dordain also outlined shortly after the European Space Summit that the primary requirement of Europe's involvement in the Kliper project was to rely on two separate systems to support the [[International Space Station|ISS]] as had been proven vital after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]] Space Shuttle disaster in 2003.

Dordain's remarks were echoed by Daniel Sacotte, ESA's director of human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration, in saying simply that "The Russians are not going to finance it, we will finance it from our side", despite adding a cautionary note that "We needed the support from at least two states out of France, Italy and Germany. We didn't get it."  What this means in practical terms remains to be seen; however, what is clear is that ESA officials are still pushing for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project.

Very negative comments relative to Kliper were brought by the various national delegations at the December meeting, in particular by the French Minister of Research [[François Goulard]]. In short, there remain for the time being member states strongly committed to Kliper, and others just as strongly opposed. The long-term view remains uncertain.

In 2006, Jean-Jacques Dordain explained that money allocated to space transportation development, which ESA currently funds in the amount of 300 million for the next 3 years, could be used for Europe's involvement in the project. Given the February 2006 statement that 5 billion rubles (~$200 million) of the development costs will come from "contractors", a limited involvement of ESA in Kliper might have been forthcoming.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===Russian Space Agency's tender for Kliper===
At the end of 2005, [[Roskosmos]] announced that a tender for Kliper would be held in January 2006 between [[RKK Energia]], [[Khrunichev]] and [[OKB-4 Molniya|Molniya]] with a selection date of February 3, 2006. However concerns about the bids led to a delay in the process, with a resubmittal deadline of March, 2006 and selection was rescheduled for April 2006. Following further delays, the tender was cancelled on 18 July 2006.&lt;ref name=flightglobal&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/07/18/Navigation/200/207935/Farnborough+Russia's+Federal+Space+Agency+cancels+manned+spacecraft.html www.flightglobal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- RSC Energia, along with two other companies, [[Khrunichev]] and [[OKB-4 Molniya|Molniya]], submitted proposals to the Russian Space Agency [[Roskosmos]] for the state tender of the Russian Space Agency for the Soyuz successor spacecraft. On July 18, 2006, the tender, that was unofficially tied with suggested ESA financial support, was cancelled. None of the three proposals were chosen by the Russian Federal Space Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/07/18/Navigation/200/207935/Farnborough+Russia's+Federal+Space+Agency+cancels+manned+spacecraft.html Flightglobal: Russia's Federal Space Agency cancels manned spacecraft tender]&lt;/ref&gt; After cancellation of the tender the Russian Space Agency has decided to collaborate with the European Space Agency on a study to develop a capsule-type spacecraft under the [[CSTS|Crew Space Transportation System]].--&gt;

In late July 2006, the Russian Space Agency and the European Space Agency agreed to collaborate on a different project to develop a new spacecraft. They decided to fund a study under a program labelled Crew Space Transportation System ([[CSTS]]) which started in September 2006 and evaluate a capsule type concept, derived from Soyuz. While this program is the follow-on project of the RSA's and ESA's collaboration on a new spacevehicle, this program is no longer connected to Energia's winged Kliper design.

&lt;!-- Energia has announced that it will try to seek private funding to develop and build its winged Kliper spacecraft, but has conceded that without the funding by the Russian government Kliper will take longer until flyoff, if it is eventually developed and built. --&gt;
RSC Energia continued to pursue the project without Russian government support and announced that it would seek private investment for the craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/07/19/Navigation/200/207953/Farnborough+Energia’s+Kliper+work+continues+with+wind+tunnel.html Flightglobal: Farnborough Air Show - Energia's Klipper work continues]&lt;/ref&gt; News reports in Russia indicated that Kliper was still expected to be ready for [[Russian Space Agency]] test flights around the year 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061226/57833667.html|title=Russia remains leader in spacecraft launches - space agency|author=Sputnik|date=26 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of Russian spacecraft upgrade program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20061220/57396095.html|title=Russia set to implement ambitious space program (Part II)|author=Sputnik|date=20 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/news/news-2006/public_07-01.html RSC Energia: Concept of Russian Manned Space Navigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701035626/http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/news/news-2006/public_07-01.html |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been officially halted in June 2007, after the major proponent of the project, Nikolai Sevastyanov, was dismissed from the position of the president of RSC Energia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive07/energia_0723.html Energia Chief Dismissed Amid Differences with Roskosmos]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly appointed president of RSC Energia, Vitaly Lopota, confirmed that Kliper would not be displayed on the 2007 MAKS aviation and space show. He said that Energia would spend more time on the project analysis, perform additional dynamic modeling, revise the design and appearance and then would come up with new proposals for Roscosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/2007/07/31/oa_245696.shtml|title=Акционеры РКК "Энергия" избрали Виталия Лопоту президентом|work=Газета.Ru|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current Progress: Kliper now part of Russian spacecraft upgrade program ===
It has recently been reported that Kliper will be developed as the final stage of Russian manned and cargo spacecraft "overhaul". According to the article, the spacecraft upgrade program stages are: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20061220/57396095.html|title=Russia set to implement ambitious space program (Part II)|author=Sputnik|date=20 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stage one: Starting in 2007, upgrade of Soyuz space vehicles. As a rule, each Soyuz crew consists of two professional astronauts and one space tourist. The revamped Soyuz, due to lift off in 2011, will carry two professionals and two passengers. Most importantly, it will be able to dock with the International Space Station, fly around the Moon and return to Earth at speeds of about 40 000 kilometers per hour (25 000 miles per hour), the equivalent of its [[escape velocity]]. ''(Note the similarity to [[European Space Agency|ESA]] requirements - this may effectively make CSTS development redundant)''
*Stage Two: Development of the Parom (Ferry) reusable transport system, which will replace the Progress cargo craft. The Parom system will comprise a reusable orbiter and expendable 12-metric-ton freight containers. This is a remarkable achievement because Progress spacecraft can now deliver just 2.5 metric tons of dry and liquid cargo to the ISS.
*Stage Three: This stage will witness the launch of a Kliper-type reusable space shuttle featuring technologies that will be streamlined during the first and second stages.

''The stages described in this report are very consistent to [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|Energia]]'s "Concept of national manned space navigation" proposal, as described by chief Nikolay Sevastiyanov on May 24, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/news/news-2006/public_07-01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Energia's lead designer of the Kliper project has said that there are plans for a manned flight in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,391480,00.html|title=International Space Race Heats Up as More Players Jump In|work=Fox News|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Design==
Given the Russian Space Agency's preference for Energia's lifting body proposal this part of the article concentrates entirely on Energia's design for Kliper.

===Overview===
Kliper's [[design]] was another attempt to solve the geometric problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, to be used for eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the docking mechanism at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later [[Salyut]] space stations had.

In connection with this new design, Kliper would feature a launch escape system that would enable it to detach from the [[carrier rocket]] if an abort of the mission during orbital ascent is required. An abort would be possible during every phase of the launch with the limitation of the first seconds after launch.&lt;ref name="RIAN-launch"/&gt;

===Lifting body design===

On return from space, Kliper's [[lifting body]] design would not only allow a smoother descent into Earth's atmosphere than the [[space capsule|capsule]] design, such as Soyuz; but also permit control. [[RKK Energia]] claimed that the craft would be able to land in a predetermined one-square-kilometre area. Artistic impressions showed that the Kliper would have resembled a cylinder topped by a cone. Originally, landing proposals involved both a landing by [[parachute]] and as an alternative, in a modified version, a landing on a runway similar to an aircraft, or the Space Shuttle. However, leading designer [[Vladimir Daneev]] commented on this issue in June 2005:
:''We are 99% sure that it will be a spaceship with upturned little wings, enabling the Kliper to land on any class-one military airfield with a runway from three to three and a half kilometres in length.''&lt;ref name=RIAN-launch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/science/20050614/40521455.html|title=Russia's new spaceship to save crew in possible LV accident|author=Sputnik|date=14 June 2005|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kliper, as a vehicle alone, would have been primarily a manned spaceship, carrying six cosmonauts and payloads of up to 700 kilograms (mostly experiments and other equipment used for carrying through experiments in orbit) and was planned to stay in orbit for approximately 15 days independently and for up to 360 days if [[space rendezvous|docked]] to the International Space Station. This highlighted both the Russian/European and the American change in space transportation philosophy. Rather than focusing on the lifting of cargo and a crew, in the same way as the Space Shuttle or [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]], the Russian space agency adopted a 'people first' philosophy with the aim of 'bolting' extra capabilities for more advanced missions onto Kliper at a later date. Each orbiter was intended to make 25 flights prior to retirement.

===Using a space tug===
During autumn of 2005 Kliper's design was changed again. In order to fit the Kliper on the planned upgraded version of the Soyuz-2 rocket, labeled the Soyuz-2-3, Kliper would be 'split up' into two spacecraft, the Kliper crew vehicle and [[Parom]] (rus. ''"ferry"''), a space tug. Parom would have been a permanent orbital spacecraft awaiting Kliper in orbit, docking with it and then providing orbital manoeuvering and boosting Kliper to higher orbits in order to dock with the [[International Space Station]]. The Parom was planned to be indefinitely reusable, refueling itself via the cargo container, space station, or spacecraft that it is attached to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kliper.html Kliper (Clipper) spacecraft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/11/01/Navigation/200/202471/Lighter+Kliper+could+make+towed+trip+to+ISS.html Lighter Kliper could make towed trip to ISS-01/11/2005-Flight International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final version of Energia's proposal===

The version of Kliper presented during the bid in January 2006 differs again from the original design. It showed a lifting body with larger wings, that, according to Energia officials, could be folded around the core crew module and unfold after atmospheric re-entry in order to provide cross-range and better landing accuracy for the spacecraft. The light Kliper version proposed was stripped down to 7 tons and uses the 'split-up'-option with Parom as a spacetug.

==Missions==

The Kliper program was proposed as the Russian-European counterpart to the American [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion Spacecraft]] and was therefore designed (similar to the Orion) to be part of a modular system that enabled it to be both a [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]]-shuttle type vehicle as well as part of a spacecraft able to go beyond Earth orbit to the Moon and even Mars (there were outline suggestions of lunar applications in September 2005).  The modular design would have included the Kliper crew module and - depending on the mission - a mission module or propulsion module. Although far-fetched, this corresponds to announcements by the [[Russian Space Agency]] that according to a lunar mission study, using the [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], a landing on the Moon could be achieved within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20051229144901/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/11/24/moon.shtml Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission capabilities were expanded further by RSC Energia, with a picture released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where [[RSC Energia]] saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an [[ion propulsion]] system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be that there was another reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.

==Carrier rockets==
The present [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] would not be able to lift Kliper into low earth orbit, because the spacecraft (the version designed without Parom) was expected to weigh between 13 and 14.5 metric tons (with payload and crew) whereas Soyuz only has a lifting capacity of around 8 metric tons. It was originally planned to heavily enhance the Soyuz rocket - a project that was labelled the [[Onega rocket]] or Soyuz-3. Until fall of 2005 it was much more likely that Kliper would have used an [[Angara rocket|Angara-A3]] rocket, which was scheduled to make its first launch in 2012 (however the Angara program has been delayed and Angara-A3 may not be developed in light of the funding of the development of Soyuz 2-3) or possibly a [[Zenit rocket]] that is built in [[Ukraine]].

At the end of 2005, Kliper's design was changed again (as outlined above) and the most likely solution for a carrier rocket became the [[Soyuz 2-3]], an upgraded [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz 2]] rocket. This enhanced Soyuz should have been able to launch Kliper into space because of weight reduction resulting in the use of the [[Parom]] as a [[space tug]].&lt;ref name=FIN-Parom&gt;[http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/11/01/Navigation/200/202471/Lighter+Kliper+could+make+towed+trip+to+ISS.html Flight International]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to launch sites for Kliper, further information became available as of October 2005, with a planning-stage declaration from Nikolai Moiseev, Deputy Director of the Russian Space Agency that Kliper could have been launched from ESA's [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]]. Though this aim had already been suggested, the comment was made in the context of facility upgrades for Kourou that are already under way since 2003 and are expected to be finished in 2007 with the first launch of a Soyuz rocket from French Guiana in 2008. It had been suggested that Kliper could have been launched from both [[Baikonur]] and [[Kourou]], by Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration directorate, in December 2005.&lt;ref name=FIN-Parom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/051207_tech_wednesday.html|title=Russia's Next Spaceship: Alternative to NASA's CEV|work=Space.com|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mathematical principles of reinforcement''' ('''MPR''') constitute of a set of [[mathematical equation]]s set forth by [[Peter Killeen]] and his colleagues attempting to describe and predict the most fundamental aspects of behavior (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). The three key principles of MPR, '''arousal''', '''constraint''', and '''coupling''', describe how [[incentive]]s motivate responding, how time constrains it, and how [[reinforcer]]s become associated with specific responses, respectively. [[Mathematical model]]s are provided for these basic principles in order to articulate the necessary detail of actual data.

== First principle: arousal ==
The first basic principle of MPR is [[arousal]]. Arousal refers to the activation of behavior by the presentation of incentives. An increase in activity level following repeated presentations of incentives is a fundamental aspect of [[operant conditioning|conditioning]]. Killeen, Hanson, and Osborne (1978) proposed that adjunctive (or schedule induced) behaviors are normally occurring parts of an organism's repertoire. Delivery of incentives increases the rate of adjunctive behaviors by generating a heightened level of general activity, or arousal, in organisms.

Killeen &amp; Hanson (1978) exposed pigeons to a single daily presentation of food in the experimental chamber and measured general activity for 15 minutes after a feeding. They showed that activity level increased slightly directly following a feeding and then decreased slowly over time. The rate of decay can be described by the following function:
:&lt;math&gt;b(t) = b_1 \times e ^ {\frac{-t}{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
: {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = y-intercept (responses per minute)
:{{mvar|t}} = time in seconds since feeding
:''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;'' = time constant
:{{mvar|e}} = [[e (mathematical constant)|base of natural logarithm]]

The time course of the entire theoretical model of general activity is modeled by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;R = A \times (e - \frac{t}{C} - e - \frac{t}{I})&lt;/math&gt;
:{{mvar|A}} = arousal
:{{mvar|I}} = temporal inhibition
:{{mvar|C}} = competing behaviors

To better conceptualize this model, imagine how rate of responding would appear with each of these processes individually. In the absence of temporal inhibition or competing responses, arousal level would remain high and response rate would be depicted as an almost horizontal line with a very small negative slope. Directly following food presentation, temporal inhibition is at its maximum level. It decreases quickly as time elapses, and response rate would be expected to increase up to the level of arousal in a short time. Competing behaviors such as goal tracking or hopper inspection are at a minimum directly after food presentation. These behaviors increase as the interval elapses, so the measure of general activity would slowly decrease. Subtracting these two curves results in the predicted level of general activity.

Killeen et al. (1978) then increased the frequency of feeding from daily to every fixed-time seconds. They showed that general activity level increased substantially from the level of daily presentation. Response rate asymptotes were highest for the highest rates of reinforcement. These experiments indicate that arousal level is proportional to rate of incitement, and the asymptotic level increases with repeated presentations of incentives. The increase in activity level with repeated presentation of incentives is called cumulation of arousal. The first principle of MPR states that arousal level is proportional to [[rate of reinforcement]], &lt;math&gt;A=ar&lt;/math&gt;, where:

{{mvar|A}}= arousal level

{{mvar|a}}= specific activation

{{mvar|r}}= rate of reinforcement

(Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

== Second principle: constraint ==
An obvious but often overlooked factor when analyzing response distributions is that responses are not instantaneous, but take some amount of time to emit (Killeen, 1994). These ceilings on response rate are often accounted for by competition from other responses, but less often for the fact that responses cannot always be emitted at the same rate at which they are elicited (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). This limiting factor must be taken into account in order to correctly characterize what responding could be theoretically, and what it will be empirically.

An organism may receive impulses to respond at a certain rate. At low rates of reinforcement, the elicited rate and emitted rate will approximate each other. At high rates of reinforcement, however, this elicited rate is subdued by the amount of time it takes to emit a response. Response rate, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, is typically measured as the number of responses occurring in an epoch divided by the duration of an epoch. The reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; gives the typical measure of the inter response (IRT), the average time from the start of one response to the start of another (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). This is actually the cycle time rather than the time between responses. According to Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003), the IRT consists of two subintervals, the time required to emit a response, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; plus the time between responses, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, response rate can be measured either by dividing the number of responses by the cycle time:
: &lt;math&gt;b = \frac{1}{\delta + \tau}&lt;/math&gt; ,

or as the number of responses divided by the actual time between responses:
: &lt;math&gt;b = \frac{1}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; .

This instantaneous rate, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; may be the best measure to use, as the nature of the operandum may change arbitrarily within an experiment (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

Killeen, Hall, Reilly, and Kettle (2002) showed that if instantaneous rate of responding is proportional to rate of reinforcement, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau} = ar&lt;/math&gt;, then a fundamental equation for MPR results. Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003) showed that:

if &lt;math&gt;\tau = 1 / ar&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{1}{(\delta+\frac{1}{ar})}&lt;/math&gt;,

and rearranging gives:

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{r}{\delta r + \frac{1}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

While responses may be elicited at a rate proportional to &lt;math&gt;A = ar&lt;/math&gt;, they can only be emitted at rate &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; due to constraint. The second principle of MPR states that the time required to emit a response constrains response rate (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

== Third principle: coupling ==
Coupling is the final concept of MPR that ties all of the processes together and allows for specific predictions of behavior with different schedules of reinforcement. Coupling refers to the association between responses and reinforcers. The target response is the response of interest to the experimenter, but any response can become associated with a reinforcer. Contingencies of reinforcement refer to how a reinforcer is scheduled with respect to the target response (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003), and the specific schedules of reinforcement in effect determine how responses are coupled to the reinforcer. The third principle of MPR states that the degree of coupling between a response and reinforcer decreases with the distance between them (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). Coupling coefficients, designated as &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;, are given for the different schedules of reinforcement. When the coupling coefficients are inserted into the activation-constraint model, complete models of conditioning are derived:

:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{c.r}{\delta r + 1/a }&lt;/math&gt;

This is the fundamental equation of MPR. The dot after the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a placeholder for the specific contingencies of reinforcement under study (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

=== Fixed-ratio reinforcement schedules ===
The rate of reinforcement for fixed-ratio schedules is easy to calculate, as reinforcement rate is directly proportional to response rate and inversely proportional to ratio requirement (Killeen, 1994). The schedule feedback function is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{b}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting this function into the complete model gives the equation of motion for ratio schedules (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). Killeen (1994, 2003) showed that the most recent response in a sequence of responses is weighted most heavily and given a weight of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, leaving &lt;math&gt;1-\beta&lt;/math&gt; for the remaining responses. The penultimate response receives &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, the third back receives &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)^2&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th response back is given a weight of &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The sum of this series is the coupling coefficient for fixed-ratio schedules:

:&lt;math&gt;c_{FR_n} = 1 - (1-\beta)^n &lt;/math&gt;

The continuous approximation of this is:

: &lt;math&gt;c_{FR_n} = 1 - e^{-\lambda n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the intrinsic rate of memory decay. Inserting the reinforcement rate and coupling coefficient into the activation-constraint model gives the predicted response rates for FR schedules:

:&lt;math&gt; b = \frac{c.}{\delta} - \frac{n}{\delta a} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation predicts low response rates at low ratio requirements due to the displacement of memory by consummatory behavior. However, these low rates are not always found. Coupling of responses may extend back beyond the preceding reinforcer, and an extra parameter, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is added to account for this. Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003) showed that the coupling coefficient for FR schedules then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;c_{FR_n} = 1 - (1 - \beta)n + n_0 = 1 - \epsilon(1-\beta)n &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is the number of responses preceding the prior reinforcer that contribute to response strength. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; which ranges from 0 to 1 is then the degree of erasure of the target response from memory with the delivery of a reinforcer. (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\epsilon = (1-\beta)n_0&lt;/math&gt;) If &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=1&lt;/math&gt;, erasure is complete and the simpler FR equation can be used.

=== Variable-ratio reinforcement schedules ===
According to Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003), the duration of a response can affect the rate of memory decay. When response durations vary, either within or between organisms, then a more complete model is needed, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with &lt;math&gt;1-e^{-\lambda\delta}&lt;/math&gt; yielding:

:&lt;math&gt;1-\epsilon(1-\beta)\delta n = 1-\epsilon e^{-\lambda \delta n}&lt;/math&gt;

Idealized variable-ratio schedules with a mean response requirement of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; have a constant probability of &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of a response ending in reinforcement (Bizo, Kettle, &amp; Killeen, 2001). The last response ending in reinforcement must always occur and receives strengthening of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The penultimate response occurs with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt; and receives a strengthening of &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)&lt;/math&gt; . The sum of this process up to infinity is (Killeen 2001, Appendix):

: &lt;math&gt;C(n) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \beta (1 - \beta)^{j-1} (1-p)^{j-1}&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The coupling coefficient for VR schedules ends up being:

&lt;math&gt;c_{VR_n}=\frac{n}{n+ \frac{(1-b)}{b}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by degree of erasure of memory gives:

&lt;math&gt;c_{VR_n}=\frac{n}{n+\epsilon\frac{(1-\beta)}{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

The coupling coefficient can then be inserted into the activation-constraint model just as the coupling coefficient for FR schedules to yield predicted response rates under VR schedules:

&lt;math&gt;b= \frac{c_{VR_n}}{\delta}-\frac{n}{\delta a}&lt;/math&gt;

In interval schedules, the schedule feedback function is

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{1}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum average time between reinforcers (Killeen, 1994). Coupling in interval schedules is weaker than ratio schedules, as interval schedules equally strengthen all responses preceding the target rather than just the target response. Only some proportion &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of memory is strengthened. With a response requirement, the final, target response must receive strength of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. All preceding responses, target or non-target, receive a strengthening of &lt;math&gt;1-\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Fixed-time schedules are the simplest time dependent schedules in which organisms must simply wait t seconds for an incentive. Killeen (1994) reinterpreted temporal requirements as response requirements and integrated the contents of memory from one incentive to the next. This gives the contents of memory to be:

N

MN= lò e-lndn

0

This is the degree of saturation in memory of all responses, both target and non-target, elicited in the context (Killeen, 1994). Solving this equation gives the coupling coefficient for fixed-time schedules:

c=r(1-e-lbt)

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of target responses in the response trajectory. Expanding into a power series gives the following approximation:

c» rlbt
 1+lbt
This equation predicts serious instability for non-contingent schedules of reinforcement.

Fixed-interval schedules are guaranteed a strengthening of a target response, b=w1, as reinforcement is contingent on this final, contiguous response (Killeen, 1994). This coupling is equivalent to the coupling on FR 1 schedules

w1=b=1-e-l.

The remainder of coupling is due to the memory of preceding behavior. The coupling coefficient for FI schedules is:

c= b +r(1- b -e-lbt).

Variable-time schedules are similar to random ratio schedules in that there is a constant probability of reinforcement, but these reinforcers are set up in time rather than responses. The probability of no reinforcement occurring before some time t’ is an exponential function of that time with the time constant t being the average IRI of the schedule (Killeen, 1994). To derive the coupling coefficient, the probability of the schedule not having ended, weighted by the contents of memory, must be integrated.
 ∞
M= lò e-n’t/te-ln’ dn’
 0
In this equation, t’=n’t, where t is a small unit of time. Killeen (1994) explains that the first exponential term is the reinforcement distribution, whereas the second term is the weighting of this distribution in memory. Solving this integral and multiplying by the coupling constant r, gives the extent to which memory is filled on VT schedules:

c=rlbt
 1+lbt

This is the same coupling coefficient as an FT schedule, except it is an exact solution for VT schedules rather than an approximation. Once again, the feedback function on these non-contingent schedules predicts serious instability in responding.

As with FI schedules, variable-interval schedules are guaranteed a target response coupling of b. Simply adding b to the VT equation gives:
 ∞
M= b+ lò e-n’t/te-ln’ dn’
 1
Solving the integral and multiplying by r gives the coupling coefficient for VI schedules:

c= b+(1-b) rlbt
 1+lbt

The coupling coefficients for all of the schedules are inserted into the activation-constraint model to yield the predicted, overall response rate. The third principle of MPR states that the coupling between a response and a reinforcer decreases with increased time between them (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

Mathematical principles of reinforcement describe how incentives fuel behavior, how time constrains it, and how contingencies direct it. It is a general theory of reinforcement that combines both contiguity and correlation as explanatory processes of behavior. Many responses preceding reinforcement may become correlated with the reinforcer, but the final response receives the greatest weight in memory. Specific models are provided for the three basic principles to articulate predicted response patterns in many different situations and under different schedules of reinforcement. Coupling coefficients for each reinforcement schedule are derived and inserted into the fundamental equation to yield overall predicted response rates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18539">'''Mode deactivation therapy''' ('''MDT''') is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approach that addresses dysfunctional emotions, maladaptive behaviors and cognitive processes and contents through a number of [[goal-oriented]], explicit systematic procedures. The name refers to the process of mode deactivation that is based on the concept of cognitive modes as introduced by [[Aaron T. Beck]]. The MDT methodology was developed by [[Jack A. Apsche]] by combining the unique validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) process step with elements from [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] to bring about durable behavior change.

==Theory==
Mode deactivation therapy (MDT) was developed by [[Jack A. Apsche]] who recognized shortcomings of cognitive theory and cognitive-behavioral therapies, especially for the treatment of populations with complex psychological problems. [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) was primarily conceptualized through an integration of [[behavior therapy]] with [[cognitive psychology]] that were formulated by [[Aaron T. Beck]]. As such, the CBT approaches focus primarily on the present rather than the past, behavioral change as the main goal, and current processes that are maintaining the problem rather than the root causes.&lt;ref name=CBT-Intro&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Westbrook D, Kennerley H, Kirk J | title= An introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy | edition= 2 | publisher= Sage | location= Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn= 9781848606876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CBT views problem manifestation as brought about by dysfunctional thinking, which is disputed as irrational beliefs and replaced with the use of logical arguments.

Eventually some practitioners realized that dysfunctional cognitions should not be disputed. As a result, a new wave of cognitive-behavioral therapies began to form, which was termed the "third wave" by Prof. [[Steven C. Hayes]], who went on to develop [[Relational frame theory]] and [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]]. ([[Behaviour therapy]] was the first wave and [[Cognitive therapy]] was the second.) Dr. [[Jack A. Apsche]] agreed in general with this principle, but also believed that there is value in exploring the origins of maladaptive thought processes in addition to validating their existence as reasonable given an individual's past experiences upon which his or her core beliefs are based.

[[Aaron T. Beck]] asserted that how people feel and behave are largely determined by their thought processes or cognitions, which may make us vulnerable to psychological distress. These vulnerabilities are related to personality structures—a person's fundamental beliefs about themselves and the world around them. Personality structures largely develop as a result of responding to environmental stimuli and experiences. When these are distressing and deprive a person of psychological needs, the coping mechanism may be viewed as maladaptive compared with normal circumstances. The personality structures are referred to as cognitive schemas, which—in combinations—inform a person how to behave in a certain situation. Cognitive schemas are often automatically activated and group together to form cognitive modes that are deep-seated and durable behavioral manifestations such as depression and aggression.

In MDT these modes and their associated core beliefs are validated and normalized in the client's perspective by cultivating awareness and acceptance rather than disputing any belief as irrational or "bad". The proposition is that awareness and acceptance improves the therapist-client bond, client cooperation, commitment and motivation, which enables an effective and durable therapeutic change process.

==Practice==
The application of MDT integrates the unique validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) process step with selected elements from [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[Dialectical behavior therapy]], and [[mindfulness (psychology)]] through a systematic and collaborative case conceptualization and implementation process.

The case conceptualization forms the blueprint of the MDT planning and implementation process, and is based on a systematic assessment procedure that is aimed at identifying, clarifying, and formulating the core beliefs → fears → thoughts and feelings → behavior sequence. First, a semi-structured clinical interview is conducted to form the foundation of further psychometric testing. The client typology survey is completed by the therapist with inputs from the client, parent/guardian, family members, and other records, including arrest and medical where relevant. It includes family information, substance abuse, medical, neglect, physical and sexual abuse and offending history, educational, emotional, behavioral, physiological, and interpersonal information. The expectations of treatment and willingness to cooperate are also noted.

Second, the Strength of Fears Questionnaire is completed and scored. The 60-item 4-point Likert scale responses is scored to examine five sub-categories of fear, namely personal reactive-external, personal reactive-internal/self-concept, environmental, physical, and abuse. The test is sensitive to the detection of trauma and identifies and rates specific fear and associated situations. Life-interfering fears are also identified.

Then, the client completes the Compound Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CCBQ), a 96-item 4-point Likert scale form (short version). The score primarily informs the therapist of the client's personality traits and structure, as well as potential life-threatening and treatment-interfering beliefs. Hereby, the CCBQ helps identify the client's underlying beliefs and thoughts that guide his or her behavior. Each belief is clarified and completed with examples.

===Case conceptualization===
The results and analyses of the client typology, Fear Assessment and Compound Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CCBQ) are used to compile the Triggers, Fears, Avoids, and Compound Core Beliefs Correlation (TFAB) and the Conglomerate of Beliefs and Behaviors (COBB) worksheets. A situational analysis associate the problem beliefs, fears, and behaviors with triggers to identify the mode activation processes that have to be deactivated. The collaborative case conceptualization process is completed with the Functional Treatment Development Form (FTDF), which informs and monitors the treatment planning and progress.

The TFAB form is used to link specific triggers with fears and core beliefs, while the COBB takes the process one step further by associating each core belief with a specific behavior. Now functional alternative beliefs, healthy alternative thoughts and compensatory strategies are identified, which is developed and reinforced through the validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) process.

===Validation–clarification–redirection===
The validation–clarification–redirection (VCR) of the functional alternative belief is what separates MDT from other CBT-based approaches. In validation, the therapist explores the grain of truth in the client's perceptions or beliefs and views them as reasonable responses given his or her life experiences. In clarification, the content of the client's responses is elucidated while awareness and acceptance is encouraged. In redirection, the therapist moves the client towards accepting a functional alternative belief through commitment and motivation to work towards positive alternatives that are more supportive of his or her life goals and aspirations.

===Mindfulness===
[[Mindfulness]] is defined as a mental state achieved by focusing one’s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one’s feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. It is helpful to cultivate awareness and acceptance of distressful thoughts and feelings in the present, a state that is necessary to be able to consciously affect change in one's condition. MDT utilizes this perspective to normalize the client's thoughts and feelings, while developing healthier functional alternative beliefs. Remember that problem thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the products of dysfunctional core beliefs that are often cultivated by distressful events.

==Applications==
MDT was specifically developed as a psychotherapy protocol for adolescents with complex problems such as conduct, mood, and mixed personality disorders that are co-existing with trauma-related and substance abuse issues, aggression. This type of psychopathology constellation is typically associated with childhood abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name="Swart1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Swart | first1= Joan | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Family Mode Deactivation Therapy (FMDT): A randomized controlled trial for adolescents with complex issues | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= 2014 | volume= 9 | pages= 11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDT methodology was proved effective to treat adolescent populations aged 14- to 18-years with a variety of problems. These include [[Conduct disorder]], [[Oppositional defiant disorder]], [[Substance use disorder]], mixed multiple [[Personality disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Mood disorder]], [[Aggression]], Sexual offending, and [[Child abuse]].&lt;ref name="Swart1" /&gt; In addition to this complex population, other conditions that are often considered as difficult-to-treat also had effective outcomes compared to traditional CBT approaches. These include aggressive narcissistic, antisocial, and psychopathic youth. Although the research studies to date have not included adults or adolescent females, there are no apparent reason why the MDT treatment approach would not be equally effective for these populations.

MDT is also applied in a family context. In fact, involving the family in the MDT treatment process has proven to be beneficial to improve collaboration, treatment outcome, and durability of changes.&lt;ref name="Swart2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Swart | first1= Joan | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Family Mode Deactivation Therapy (MDT) mediation analysis | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= 2014 | volume= 9 | pages= 1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDT has been applied in outpatient and institutional settings.

==Evaluation of effectiveness==
To date, there has been 10 separate MDT research studies.&lt;ref name="Swart3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Swart | first1= Joan | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Mode Deactivation Therapy: Reanalysis and Interpretation | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= in press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a meta-analysis suggest that there is a large effect size for both family-based and individual Mode Deactivation Therapy (MDT).&lt;ref name="Bass1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Bass | first1= Cristopher | last2= Apsche | first2= Jack A. | title= Update and review of Mode Deactivation Therapy family and individual meta-analysis | journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | year= 2014 | volume= 9 | pages= 39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant reduction of all negative behaviors from intake to post-treatment and beyond as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]] (CBCL) and [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] (STAXI-II). Conventional treatments for the same populations produced insignificant change.&lt;ref name="Swart3" /&gt; Applying MDT, the CBCL internalizing and externalizing scales declined by an average of about 35% and the STAXI total anger expression decreased by a similar margin (37%). Comparative improvements with treatment as usual were consistently around 5%.

==Criticisms==
In a review of the 2010-book,&lt;ref name=MDT_Book&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Apsche JA, DiMeo L |title= Mode Deactivation Therapy for aggression and oppositional behavior in adolescents: An integrative methodology using ACT, DBT, and CBT |year=2010 |publisher= New Harbinger |location= Oakland, CA  |isbn= 978-1608821075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Calleja,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/1066480713505071 | title= Book review: Mode deactivation therapy for aggression and oppositional behavior in adolescents |year=2014 | last1= Calleja | first1= Nancy D. | journal= The Family Journal | volume= 22 | pages= 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; remarked that MDT also incorporated a psychodynamic element by exploring early childhood experiences and deterministic behaviors. "Whereas some believe that this type of theoretical eclecticism is precisely what is needed to treat complex issues, others may have difficulty finding coherence in this type of model." (p.&amp;nbsp;136). Furthermore, as an approach that is claimed to be evidence-based, research that support the conceptual model remain fairly limited, especially independent studies.

'''Moralism''' is a philosophy that arose in the 19th century that concerns itself with imbuing society with a certain set of [[moral]]s, usually traditional behaviour, but also "justice, freedom, and equality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theissen |first1=Gerd |title=The Bible And Contemporary Culture |date=2007 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=9781451408607 |page=147 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has strongly affected American and British culture, concerning private issues such as the family unit and sexuality, as well as issues that carry over into the public square, such as the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref name="KingemannFuchsZielonka2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klingemann |first1=Hans-Dieter |last2=Fuchs |first2=Dieter |last3=Zielonka |first3=Jan |title=Democracy and Political Culture in Eastern Europe |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134170418 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In tracing the origins of moralism, sociologist Malcolm Waters writes that "Moralism emerged from a clash between the unrestrained character of frontier expansionism, a middle-class, Protestant emphasis on respectability cultivated in small-town America and an egalitarian and anti-intellectual evangelism among splinter Protestant groups."&lt;ref name="Walters2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Malcolm |title=Daniel Bell |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134845576 |page=73 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the issues of [[Abolitionism|abolition]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] formed the "twin pillars" of moralism, becoming popular through Christian Churches in the United States, both [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="Welter2011"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Welter |first1=Brian |title=Philosophy professor finds both Christians, secularists lacking |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2011/philosophy-professor-finds-both-christians-secularists-lacking.cfm |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |language=English|date=6 May 2011|quote=In many essays, Taylor shows how this excessive moralism in both the Protestant and Catholic churches from the 17th century onward led to a "polite" Christian society where being polite was more important than being Christian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robins |first1=R. G. |title=A. J. Tomlinson: Plainfolk Modernist |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199883172 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moralism as promoted by some Christian denominations, such as the [[Quakers]], manifested in wide support for [[abolitionism]] and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=James Emmett |title=Imaginary Friends: Representing Quakers in American Culture, 1650-1950 |date=2009 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299231743 |pages=51 |language=English|quote=Still operating at the margins of American religious discourse, Quaker civic moralism would see its legitimacy in the public sphere grow as increasing numbers of American citizens grew sympathetic with the Unionist and abolitionist causes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rise of [[postmillennialism]] in the 19th century "encouraged a general culture of Protestant moralism and pushed it toward a series of social reform movements, from antislavery and abolitionism (freedom for the slaves now), to protests against Indian Removal, to antiwar and peace efforts, to women's rights, to temperance work before and after the Civil War."&lt;ref name="BrekusGilpin2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brekus |first1=Catherine A. |first2=W. Clark | last2 =Gilpin |title=American Christianities: A History of Dominance and Diversity |date=2011 |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |isbn=9780807869147 |page=50 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the campaign for [[women's suffrage]], evidenced by the ethos of organisations such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), was highly driven by the moralism of that era.&lt;ref name="Delany2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delany |first1=Sheila |title=Writing Woman: Sex, Class and Literature, Medieval and Modern |date=2007 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781556354434 |pages=11 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of 20th century, as well as the 21st century, moralists in the United States turned their attention to championing the [[pro-life movement]].&lt;ref name="KingemannFuchsZielonka2006"/&gt; Moralists have also focused their efforts in maintaining [[blue laws]], such as those that discourage [[Sunday shopping]], in accordance with [[first-day Sabbatarian]] beliefs that resonate with the sensibilities of labourers and trade unions.&lt;ref name="Steinfels2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinfels |first1=Peter |title=The Neoconservatives: The Origins of a Movement: With a New Foreword, From Dissent to Political Power |date=2013 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781476729701 |page=37 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The concept of '''negative and positive [[frequency]]''' can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a ''signed value'' of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. ''cycles'') per second ([[hertz]]) or [[radians per second|radian/second]] (where 1&amp;nbsp;cycle corresponds to 2''π''&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s).

==Sinusoids==
Let ''ω'' be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec.  Then the angular function (angle vs. time) {{nowrap|−''ωt'' + ''θ''}}, has slope −''ω'', which is called a '''negative frequency'''.  But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' − ''θ'')}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, {{nowrap|sin(−''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' − ''θ'' + ''π'')}}.  Thus any [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] can be represented in terms of positive frequencies.  The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

[[File:Negative frequency.svg|thumb|right|300px|A negative frequency causes the sin function (violet) to lead the cos (red) by 1/4 cycle.]]
[[File:Unit_circle.svg|thumb|right|300px|The vector {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}} rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/second, and completes a circle every 2''π'' seconds.  The vector {{nowrap|(cos −''t'', sin −''t'')}} rotates in the other direction (not shown).]]
The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} leads {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} by 1/4 cycle (= ''π''/2 radians) when {{nowrap|''ω'' &gt; 0}}, and lags by 1/4 cycle when {{nowrap|''ω'' &lt; 0}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, a vector, {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}}, rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector {{nowrap|(cos −t, sin −t)}} rotates in the other direction.

The sign of ''ω'' is also preserved in the [[complex-valued function]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t} = \underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{R(t)} + i\cdot \underbrace{\sin(\omega t)}_{I(t)},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is called [[Euler's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

since R(''t'') and I(''t'') can be separately extracted and compared.  Although &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:
* It simplifies many important [[Euler's formula#Relationship to trigonometry|trigonometric calculations]], which leads to its formal description as the [[analytic signal|analytic representation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Euler's formula|Relationship to trigonometry}} and {{section link|Phasor|Addition}} for examples of calculations simplified by the complex representation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corollary of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\left(e^{i \omega t} + e^{-i \omega t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
which gives rise to the interpretation that cos(''ωt'') comprises ''both'' positive and negative frequencies.&amp;nbsp; But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information.  Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because ''ω'' can have only one sign.&lt;ref&gt;Conversely, any measure that indicates only one frequency has made an assumption, perhaps based on collateral information.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;  The [[Fourier transform]], for instance, merely tells us that cos(''ωt'') correlates equally well with both {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') + ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}} and with {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') − ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==

Perhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = \int_{a}^{b} x(t)\cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function ''x''(''t'') over the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.  When evaluated as a continuous function of ''ω'' for the theoretical interval {{nowrap|(−∞, ∞)}}, it is known as the [[Fourier transform]] of ''x''(''t'').  A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies.  So when ''ω'' is positive, &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; causes all the frequencies of ''x''(''t'') to be reduced by amount ''ω''.  Whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency ''ω'' is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original ''ω'' content.  And whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −''ω''.  Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values.  As the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion.  But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero.  So ''X''(''ω'') improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency ''ω'' in the function ''x''(''t'').

The [[Fourier transform]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; produces a non-zero response only at frequency ''ω''.  The transform of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; has responses at both ''ω'' and −''ω'', as anticipated by {{EquationNote|Eq.2}}.

==Sampling of positive and negative frequencies and aliasing==
{{Main article|Aliasing#Complex sinusoids}}
[[File:Aliasing between a positive and a negative frequency.png|frame|left|This figure depicts two complex sinusoids, colored gold and cyan, that fit the same sets of real and imaginary sample points.  They are thus aliases of each other when sampled at the rate (''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') indicated by the grid lines.  The gold-colored function depicts a positive frequency, because its real part (the cos function) leads its imaginary part by 1/4 of one cycle.  The cyan function depicts a negative frequency, because its real part lags the imaginary part.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">An '''oral law''' is a [[code of conduct]] in use in a given [[culture]], [[religion]] or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by [[oral tradition]] and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, 195-201&lt;/ref&gt; primarily based on the "linear world of academia" where only written down records are accepted. However, "standard" theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goody, pp.27-68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral law in jurisprudence ==
From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a [[Habituation|habit]], or [[convention (norm)|custom]] with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal [[rights]] and [[Law of obligations|obligation]]s);
*a spoken command  or order that has to be respected as a [[law]] (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in [[jurisprudence]] as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a [[judge]] (ordinarily producing a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a [[punishment]] has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like [[the Mafia]] do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

== Oral law in Judaism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{main|Oral Torah}}

Although the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term "[[Torah]]" is often translated as "Law", it can just as accurately be translated as "Instruction" or "teaching".  [[Rabbinic Judaism]] maintains that the books of the [[Tanakh]] were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation.  Thus, in Judaism, the "Written Instruction" (''Torah she-bi-khtav'' תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the [[Tanakh]]; the "Oral Instruction" (''Torah she-be'al peh'' תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the [[Talmud]] (lit. "Learning") and [[Midrash]]im (lit. "Interpretations").  The interpretation of the [[Oral Torah]] is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the [[Tanakh|Written Torah]]. Further, [[Halakha]] (lit. "The Path", frequently translated as "Jewish Law") is based on a "Written Instruction" together with an "Oral Instruction". Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

'''Overqualification''' is the state of being skilled or educated beyond what is necessary for a [[job (role)|job]]. There can often be high costs for companies associated with training [[employee]]s. This could be a problem for professionals applying for a job where they significantly exceed the job requirements because potential employers may feel they are using the position as a stepping stone.

In some societies, overqualification has become increasingly common as the proportion of college graduates in a population grows faster than the proportion of jobs in an economy which actually require college-level skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Jenner| first =Judy| title =Settling in: Recent college graduates overqualified, underemployed| website =Schools.com| publisher =QuinStreet, Inc.| date =5 September 2013| url =http://www.schools.com/articles/recent-college-graduates-overqualified-underemployed.html| accessdate = 30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a euphemism==

The concept of overqualification is often a [[euphemism]] used by employers when they do not want to reveal their true reasons for not hiring an applicant.  The term "overqualified" can mask [[age discrimination]], but it can also mask legitimate concerns of an employer, such as uncertainty of an applicant's ability to do the job, or concerns that they only want a job on a temporary basis, while they seek another more desirable position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2008/08/14/lindgren_overqualified.html "What does ‘overqualified’ mean?", ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', Aug. 14, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Being overqualified also often means that a person was asking for too high a salary.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/05/31/370688/index.htm|title=Anne Fisher, "'Overqualified' May Be A Smokescreen", ''Fortune'', May 31, 2004.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/20/AR2008122000441.html|title=Vickie Elmer, "Getting an 'Overqualified' Response", ''Washington Post'', Dec. 21, 2008; Page K01.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Overqualified" can also be used to describe a resistance to new [[technologies]], or a [[pompous]] approach.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

In the definition above, which states that an overqualified person may take a job to gain knowledge and leave the company, this could also apply to all other employees of the same company. The term overqualified, in any definition, should be considered as a subjective term developed by the person doing the evaluation of the applicant based upon their point of view which may in itself be biased. There comes a time in a person's life, when a choice is made to reduce the level of responsibility and one could consider the perceived overqualification as "added value" to the company when the applicant is willing to take a lower-level position, accompanied by a lower salary. When the decision is not based upon factual or unbiased factors, discrimination has occurred.

In the United States, the term "overqualified" has been found by the courts to sometimes be used as a "code word for too old" (i.e., age discrimination) in the hiring process.&lt;ref&gt;Hamm v. New York City Office of the Comptroller (D. Ct. NY, March 4, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protecting less qualified candidates==
The governmental employing institution may have written or unwritten upper qualification limits for a particular position. These limits protect less qualified people like newly graduated students, allowing them to find a job as well. For instance, in countries like Germany or Switzerland, a paid position of a PhD student may normally not be given for an applicant who already has a PhD degree.

Also, a short but successful career may be preferred over longer (so more various different experience) but overall less successful career.

==Responses to being described as overqualified==
Noluthando Crockett-Ntonga recommends that job applicants address potential concerns such as salary requirements in a [[cover letter]] and [[interview]] before the employer makes any comments about overqualification.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; Barbara Moses advises applicants who are described as being overqualified to emphasize their willingness to [[mentor]] younger co-workers, and to focus on what attracts them about the position they are applying to rather than emphasizing their ambition or desire to be challenged.&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; Being overqualified can be an asset for employers, especially when the breadth of one's experience enables them to take on additional responsibilities in ways that benefit the employer.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

==The PhD==

The [[PhD]] can reflect overspecialization that manifests itself as a lack of perspective; for example, a PhD might not adequately prepare one for careers in development, manufacturing, or technical management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://units.aps.org/units/fiap/newsletters/nov95/03.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421004607/http://units.aps.org/units/fiap/newsletters/nov95/03.cfm |archivedate=April 21, 2008 }} John A. Armstrong, "Rethinking the PhD", originally appeared in ''Issues in Science and Technology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the corporate world, some PhD graduates have been criticized as being unable to turn theories into useful strategies and being unable to work on a team, although PhDs are seen as desirable and even essential in many positions, such as supervisory roles in research, especially PhDs in [[biomedical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22107688_ITM|title=Lee Anna Jackson, "Past the prestige: what career options does your Ph.D. offer?(Making Connections)", ''Black Enterprise'', Aug. 1, 2004.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in some college jobs, people can associate negative factors with the PhD, including a lack of focus on [[teaching]], overspecialization, and an undesirable set of professional priorities, often focusing on self-promotion.  These forces have led both to an increase in some educational institutions hiring candidates without PhDs as well as a focus on the development of other doctoral degrees, such as the D.A. or [[Doctor of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.ade.org/ade/bulletin/n027/027004.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071020004552/http://web2.ade.org/ade/bulletin/n027/027004.htm |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }} Edmond L. Volpe, "A Portrait of the PhD as a Failure", ''ADE Bulletin'', 027 (November 1970): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some employers have reservations about hiring people with PhDs in full-time, entry-level positions but are eager to hire them in temporary positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Breaking-In-as-a-Temp/45219 Susan Basalla May, "Behind the Ivory Tower: Breaking In as a Temp", ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', May 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this reservation is rather a reaction associated with job insecurity, especially in situations where most of the company leaders hold lower qualifications than the PhD; as part of the wide phenomenon of [[credential creep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mauno|first=Saija|title=Multi-wave, multi-variable models of job insecurity: applying different scales in studying the stability of job insecurity|url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~mgto650r/clee/Day_2_reading_material/multi-wave.pdf|work=Journal of Organizational Behavior|author2=Leskinen, Esko|author3=Kinnunen, Ulla|pages=919–937|doi=10.1002/job.122|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032218/http://teaching.ust.hk/~mgto650r/clee/Day_2_reading_material/multi-wave.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of  perseverative cognition is: "the repeated or chronic activation of the cognitive representation of one or more psychological stressors".&lt;ref name="BGT2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "VBGT2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verkuil | first1 = B. | last2 = Brosschot | first2 = J.F. | last3 = Gebhardt | first3 = W.A. | last4 = Thayer | first4 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = When worries make you sick: A review of perseverative cognition, the default stress response and somatic health | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychopathology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 87–118 | doi = 10.5127/jep.009110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Worry]], [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]] and all other forms of thought ([[cognition]]) involving stressful events, in the past or in the future, fall under the definition of perseverative cognition. 'Just thinking about your problems, without calling it worrying or rumination', is also perseverative cognition, as is [[mind wandering]] when it concerns negative topics.&lt;ref name="OSC2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OC2013"/&gt; Importantly, there is a large body of knowledge about the typical constituents of perseverative cognition, such as worry, rumination, repetitive thinking and (negative) mind wandering (reviewed in Watkins, 2008&lt;ref name="W2008"/&gt;).
Perseverative cognition may partly be [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].&lt;ref name="B2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brosschot | first1 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Markers of chronic stress: Prolonged physiological activation and (un)conscious perseverative cognition | url = | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 46–50 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.01.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BVT2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brosschot | first1 = J.F. | last2 = Verkuil | first2 = B. | last3 = Thayer | first3 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Conscious and unconscious perseverative cognition: Is a large part of prolonged physiological activity due to unconscious stress? | url = | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 407–16 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as people are not aware of the larger part of their thoughts (cognition),&lt;ref name="BM2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bargh | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Morsella | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = The unconscious mind | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 73–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00064.x | pmid=18584056 | pmc=2440575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Nordgren | first2 = L.F. | year = 2006 | title = A theory of unconscious thought | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 95–109 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; they may also not be aware of the cognitive representation of stressors.

'''The 'perseverative cognition hypothesis{{'}}'''&lt;ref name="BGT2006" /&gt;  holds that stressful events cannot affect people's health, unless they think repetitively or continuously (that is, 'perseverate cognitively') about these stressful events. Stressful events themselves are often too short, as are the physiological responses to them. Therefore the physiological responses during these stressors are unlikely to cause bodily harm. More importantly, many stressful events are merely worried about, or feared in the future, while they often do not happen or do not have the feared consequences. Nevertheless, the body reacts with prolonged physiological responses to continuous thoughts (perseverative cognition) about these stressors. Therefore it is the perseverative cognition, and not the stressors that can eventually lead to disease. In scientific terms, it is said that perseverative cognition is a [[wikt:Special:Search/mediator|mediator]] of the detrimental effects of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] on one's health. Since its publication scientific evidence for this hypothesis has been accumulating.&lt;ref name="VBGT2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "GS2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geurts | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Sonnentag | first2 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Recovery as an explanatory mechanism in the relation between acute stress reactions and chronic health impairment | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environtal Health | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 482–92 | doi = 10.5271/sjweh.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "LC2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsen | first1 = B.A | last2 = Christenfeld | first2 = N.J.S. | year = 2009 | title = Cardiovascular Disease and Psychiatric Comorbidity: The Potential Role of Perseverative Cognition | url = | journal = Cardiovascular Psychiatry and Neurology | volume =  2009| issue = | pages =  1–8| doi = 10.1155/2009/791017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "FMBK2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flaxman | first1 = P.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''problem of religious language''' considers whether it is possible to talk about [[God]] meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful.

Traditionally, religious language has been explained as [[Apophatic theology|via negativa]], analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The ''via negativa'' is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise [[ineffability|ineffable]] experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.

Empiricist [[David Hume|David Hume's]] requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement, particularly the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically&amp;nbsp;– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher [[Antony Flew]] proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.

The analogy of [[language-games|games]]&amp;nbsp;– most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;nbsp;– has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. [[R. M. Hare]] used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of "bliks"&amp;nbsp;– unfalsifiable [[belief-in|belief]]s according to which a worldview is established&amp;nbsp;– which are not necessarily meaningless. [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of [[eschatological verification]], the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.

==Problem of religious language==
Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all,{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=139–140}} which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1}} The French philosopher [[Simone Weil]] expressed this problem in her work ''Waiting for God'', in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1}}

The medieval doctrine of [[divine simplicity]] also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental properties]]&amp;nbsp;– these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the [[Bible]] regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1–2}}

The theologian [[Sallie McFague]] believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased [[secularism|secularisation]] of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both [[idolatry|idolatrous]] because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1–2}}

==Classical understanding of religious language==

===Via negativa===
[[File:Rambam-portrait.jpg|thumb|18th-century depiction of Maimonides, who developed the ''via negativa'']]

[[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Maimonides]] believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God.{{sfn|Levin|Schweid|2008|p=237}} Maimonides believed that God is [[divine simplicity|simple]] and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes.{{sfn|Hyman|2008|p=400}} He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, "God lives" should be taken as "God does not lack vitality".{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=88}} Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God.{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=89}}

===Analogy===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} An analogous term is partly [[univocity|univocal]] (has only one meaning) and partly [[Equivocation|equivocal]] (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject.{{sfn|Cahalan|1985|p=438}} He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.{{sfn|Weed|2007}}

Philosopher [[Taede A. Smedes|Taede Smedes]] argued that religious language is symbolic.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}} Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=41}} Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=43}} He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently).{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=45-46}} Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God ''pro nobis'' (for us) and not ''in se'' (as such) or ''sine nobis'' (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}}

In the twentieth century, [[Ian Ramsey]] developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by [[Alister McGrath]]. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God.{{sfn|McGrath|2011|loc=ch. 13}} The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.{{sfn|McGrath|1998|p=183}}

===Symbolism===
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|thumb|Sikh religious text, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan, in which religious language is used symbolically]]
Philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=134}} Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality.{{sfn|Dourley|1975|p=85–6}} Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.{{sfn|Rees|2001|p=80}}

[[Louis Dupré (philosopher)|Louis Dupré]] differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1}} Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1–2}} A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=2}} Dupré differentiates between religious and [[aesthetic]] symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=6}}

[[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.{{sfn|Pasewark|Pool|1999|p=103}}

In the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religious text the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the [[religious experience|experiences]] they have while [[meditation|meditating]] are [[ineffability|ineffable]], incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous&amp;nbsp;– this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=185}} To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=186}}

===Myth===
William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as "[[Folklore|folktale]]s".{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}} Using the example of [[creation myth]]s, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory.{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}}

[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] proposed that the Bible contains [[existentialism|existential]] content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=81}} Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=82}} Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.{{sfn|Dray|2002|p=259}}

Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He offered a demythologised [[Christology]], arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the [[Son of God]] was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented.{{sfn|Mbogu|2008|p=117}} Hick believed that demythologising the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1987|p=7}}

==Alternative explanations of religious language==

===Political===
Islamic philosopher [[Carl Ernst]] has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=8}} Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=9}}

===Performative===
Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making [[Truth claim|truth-claim]]s; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=78}} He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses ''performative'', as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words "I promise" perform the action of promising themselves&amp;nbsp;– Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=79–80}} Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that "the meaning of the language is in the use", taking the use of language to be performative.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} The philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=26}} He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51}} Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51–2}}

===Imperative===
British philosopher [[R. B. Braithwaite]] attempted to approach religious language [[empiricism|empirically]] and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of "meaning as use".{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=49}} He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and [[parable]]s.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=121}}

Professor [[Nathan Katz (professor)|Nathan Katz]] writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the [[Buddha]] in the [[Lotus Sutra]], which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.{{sfn|Katz|1982|p=232}}

==Challenges to religious language==

===David Hume===
In the conclusion of his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}
{{Quote|Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact of existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.|David Hume|''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}}}
Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=171–2}}

===Logical positivism===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Alfred Jules Ayer.jpg|thumb|A. J. Ayer argued that religious language is meaningless because it is unverifiable.]] --&gt;
The [[logical positivism]] movement originated in the [[Vienna Circle]] and was continued by British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The Vienna Circle adopted the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction between analytic and synthetic statements]]: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}} To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a [[verifiability theory of meaning]], which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable.{{sfn|Weinberg|2001|p=1}} Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

In 1936, Ayer wrote ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless.{{sfn|Attfield|2006|p=11}} He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be [[logical truth|necessarily true]], like mathematical statements.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}} In doing so, he rejected [[metaphysics]], which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless.{{sfn|Oppy|Scott|2010|p=8}} Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God&amp;nbsp;– theistic, atheistic and agnostic&amp;nbsp;– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' with the proposition that "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the ''mystical'', which cannot be described, as important.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=110}} Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=111}}

===Falsification===
The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is [[unfalsifiable]] because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Antony Flew]] argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement "God loves us" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}}

Using [[John Wisdom]]'s [[Parable of the Invisible Gardener|parable of the invisible gardener]], Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=44}} Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a "death by a thousand qualifications" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=172}} Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=283–284}}

Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless.  Drawing specifically on the emerging science of [[molecular genetics]] (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion "that there is no creator God" might be falsified;  "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done."{{sfn|Flew|2007|p=124}}

==Analogies of games==
The analogy of a game was first proposed by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in an attempt to demonstrate the [[epistemology|epistemic]] unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=111}} Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; [[Christianity]] teaches this to be the [[logos (Christianity)|divine word]] which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Cooper|2006|p=217–218}}

Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative [[language-game]] analogy.{{sfn|Labron|2006|p=28}} He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}} Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context.{{sfn|Glock|1996|p=192–193}} Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".{{sfn|Brenner|1999|p=16}}
{{quote|It is as if someone were to say: 'A game consists of moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...'&amp;nbsp;– and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others.|Ludwig Wittgenstein|''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}}}}
Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional&amp;nbsp;– a confession of what someone feels and believes&amp;nbsp;– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.{{sfn|Clack|1999|p=79}}

[[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.{{sfn|Lacewing|Pascal|2007|p=173–4}}

Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=93}} Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the [[apologetics]] of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=94–95}}

==Parables==

===R. M. Hare===
In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people&amp;nbsp;– religious and non-religious&amp;nbsp;– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by [[empirical evidence]]. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=173}} Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=37–38}}

===Basil Mitchell===
Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=148}} Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views.{{sfn|Griffiths|Taliaferro|2003|p=108–109}} He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

===John Hick===
{{See also|Eschatological verification}}
Responding to the verification principle, [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of [[eschatological verificationism]]. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2003|p=145–146}} Hick believed that eschatological verification is "unsymmetrical" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary "symmetrical" statements, which can be verified or falsified.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=39}}

In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}} Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}}

James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in [[religious pluralism]]. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in [[bodily resurrection]] can still be verified.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

{{Criminal defenses}}
{{Rights}}

The '''right of self-defense''' (also called, when it applies to the defense of another, '''alter ego defense''', '''defense of others''', '''defense of a third person''') is the right for people to use reasonable force or defensive force, for the purpose of defending one's own life ([[self-defense]]) or the lives of others, including –in certain circumstances– the use of [[deadly force]].&lt;ref&gt;For the rationale of Self-defense, see: Boaz Sangero, Self-Defence in Criminal Law 11 - 106 (Hart Publishing, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

If a defendant uses defensive force because of a threat of deadly or grievous harm by the other person, or a reasonable perception of such harm, the defendant is said to have a "perfect self-defense" [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]].&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt; If defendant uses defensive force because of such a perception, and the perception is not reasonable, the defendant may have an "[[imperfect self-defense]]" as an [[excuse]].&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

== Theory ==
{{see also|Self-defence in international law}}
{{quote|Justification does not make a criminal use of force lawful;  if the use of force is justified, it cannot be criminal at all.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law (London: 2012) at Chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The early theories make no distinction between [[civil defense|defense]] of the person and defense of property. Whether consciously or not, this builds on the [[Roman law|Roman Law]] principle of ''dominium'' where any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the ''[[pater familias]]''{{spaced ndash}} the male head of the household, sole owner of all property belonging to the household, and endowed by law with dominion over all his descendants through the male line no matter their age.&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'', Frier &amp; McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Oxford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The right to self-defense is phrased as the principle of ''vim vi repellere licet'' ("it is permitted to repel force by force") in the [[Digest (Roman law)|''Digest'' of Justitian]] (6th century).

In ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), [[Hobbes]] (using the English term ''self-defense'' for the first time) proposed the foundation political theory that distinguishes between a [[state of nature]] where there is no authority and a modern state. Hobbes argues that although some may be stronger or more intelligent than others in their natural state, none are so strong as to be beyond a fear of violent death, which justifies self-defense as the highest necessity. In the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] asserts the reason why an owner would give up their autonomy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In earlier times before the development of national policing, an attack on the family home was effectively either an assault on the people actually inside or an indirect assault on their welfare by depriving them of shelter and/or the means of production. This linkage between a personal attack and property weakened as societies developed but the threat of violence remains a key factor. As an aspect of [[sovereignty]], in his 1918 speech ''Politik als Beruf'' ([[Politics as a Vocation]]), [[Max Weber]] defined a [[State (polity)|state]] as an authority claiming the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]] within defined territorial boundaries. Recognizing that the modern framework of [[nation]]s has emerged from the use of force, Weber asserted that the exercise of power through the institutions of [[government]] remained indispensable for effective government at any level which necessarily implies that self-help is limited if not excluded.

For modern theorists, the question of self-defense is one of [[morality|moral]] authority within the nation to set the limits to obedience to the state and its laws given the pervasive dangers in a world full of weapons. In modern societies, states are increasingly delegating or privatizing their coercive powers to corporate providers of security services either to supplement or replace components within the power hierarchy. The fact that states no longer claim a monopoly to police within their borders, enhances the argument that individuals may exercise a right or privilege to use violence in their own defense. Indeed, modern [[libertarianism]] characterizes the majority of laws as intrusive to personal autonomy and, in particular, argues that the right of self-defense from [[coercion]] (including [[violence]]) is a fundamental [[human right]], and in all cases, with no exceptions, justifies all uses of [[violence]] stemming from this right, regardless whether in defense of the person or property. In this context, note that Article 12 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inclusion of defense of one's family and home recognizes the universal benefit claimed to stem from the family's peaceable possession of private property. This general approach implicitly attacks [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld|Hohfeld's]] focus on the [[corelative|correlative]] relationship between right and duty as an aspect of human interactiveness as opposed to rights deemed implicitly more important because they attach to a person by virtue of his or her ownership of property. Further, it follows that, in this moral balancing exercise, laws must simultaneously criminalize aggression resulting in loss or injury, but decriminalize qualitatively identical violence causing loss or injury because it is used in self-defense. As a resolution of this apparent paradox and in defiance of Hohfeld, [[Robert Nozick]] asserted that there are no positive [[civil rights]], only rights to property and the right of autonomy. In this theory, the "acquisition principle" states that people are entitled to defend and retain all holdings acquired in a just way and the "rectification principle" requires that any violation of the first principle be repaired by returning holdings to their rightful owners as a "one time" redistribution. Hence, in default of self-defense in the first instance, any damage to property must be made good either in kind or by value. Similarly, theorists such as George Fletcher and Robert Schopp have adopted European concepts of autonomy in their liberal theories to justify the right-holder using all necessary force to defend his or her autonomy and rights. This right inverts the ''felicitation principle'' of [[utilitarianism]] with the responsive violence being the greatest good to the individual, but accurately mirrors [[Jeremy Bentham]] who saw property as the driving force to enable individuals to enhance their utilities through stable investment and trade. In liberal theory, therefore, to maximise the utility, there is no need to retreat nor use only proportionate force. The attacker is said to sacrifice legal protection when initiating the attack. In this respect, the criminal law is not the tool of a [[welfare state]] which offers a safety net for all when they are injured. Nevertheless, some limits must be recognized as where a minor initial attack simply becomes a pretext for an excessively violent response. The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems have a theory of "abuse of right" to explain denial of justification in such extreme cases.

== Defense of others ==
{{Tort law|defenses}}

The rules are the same when force is used to protect ''another'' from danger.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Generally, the defendant must have a reasonable belief that the third party is in a position where they have the right of self-defense. For example, a person who unknowingly chances upon two actors practicing a fight would be able to defend their restraint of the one that appeared to be the aggressor. However, in many jurisdictions a person who causes injury in defense of another may be liable to criminal and civil charges if such defence turned out to be unnecessary.

Defense of others is called ''[[pikuach nefesh]]'' in [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. One must violate most negative commandments of the [[Torah]] in order to save someone's life.

== Legal Defense for Self-Defense Claim ==
When trying to claim a self-defense case it will all depend on the threat. Was it a verbal threat to where the person felt threatened. To where he or she felt like they needed to defend themselves. It will also depend on if the threat was imminent or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/i/imminent-danger/|title=Imminent Danger Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Was the threat about to happen, was the person's life really in danger. Did he or she provoke the person for the attack to happen. When the person attacked the person, did his or hers self-defense match the threat. Was it an overkill to where the person ended up dead. To where you didn't need to put that much force towards a person. Was it a 'castle doctrine' defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/castle_doctrine|title=Castle Doctrine|last=Ryan|first=Ms. Meghan|date=2009-11-16|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Did they intentionally break in your home and try to harm you or your family to where he or she had to defend themselves or others using deadly force. To claim self-defense one of these things must have happened. 

==Model Penal Code==
[[Model Penal Code]] §3.04 contains an elaborate formulation for use of force, including when it is justified, and limitations on the justification.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

==Common law cases==
In ''[[People v. La Voie]]'', Supreme Court of Colorado, 395 P.2d 1001 (1964), The court wrote, ''"When a person has reasonable grounds for believing, and does in fact actually believe, that danger of his being killed, or of receiving great bodily harm, is imminent, he may act on such appearances and defend himself, even to the extent of taking human life when necessary, although it may turn out that the appearances were false, or although he may have been mistaken as to the extent of the real actual danger."''

}}
According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

'''Stone throwing''' or '''rock throwing''' is the act of throwing a [[stone]]. When it is directed at another person (called '''stone pelting''' in India), it is a form of criminal [[assault]].

==History==
Throwing of rocks or stones is one of the most ancient forms of ranged-weapon combat, with [[sling (weapon)|slings]] used to increase the range of such projectiles having been found among other weapons in the tomb of [[Tutankhamen]], who died about 1325 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/carter/585y-p1324.html Image of sling from the Tomb of Tutankhamen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060403131635/https://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/carter/585y-p1324.html |date=2006-04-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many places, rocks are readily available as weapons, more so than more sophisticated weapons. Because rocks are dense, hard objects, a forcefully thrown rock can do substantial damage to a target, particularly if the rock has sharp or jagged edges.

Historically, [[stoning]] was used as a method of [[human execution]] in several cultures.

==At vehicles==

Rocks thrown at cars moving along highways at high speeds have been a problem in a number of countries.&lt;ref name=Janzen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janzen|first1=Eric|title=13 rock-throwing incidents reported along I-35 since June|url=http://kxan.com/2014/11/04/13-rock-throwing-incidents-reported-along-i-35-since-june/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=KXAN|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beavin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beavin|first1=Angie|title=Man still in rehab months after rock was thrown from overpass|url=http://kxan.com/2014/11/03/man-still-in-rehab-months-after-rock-was-thrown-from-overpass/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=KXAN|date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wndshield&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon Twp woman critical after rock thrown through car windshield|url=http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/summit-county/2014/07/15/sharon-twp-woman-critical-after-rock-thrown-through-car-windshield/12688955//|accessdate=12 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=WKYX|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=injured&gt;{{cite news|title=Teens tell court they 'never thought they would hurt anyone' when they tossed 5lb rock onto military mother's car from overpass leaving her critically injured|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2728590/Teen-testifies-against-pal-rock-throwing-case.html#ixzz3X7rBQHaX|accessdate=12 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=Daily Mail|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Lara|title=Arrests Made in Rock-Throwing Incident that Critically Injured Woman|url=http://wnep.com/2014/07/11/rock-thrown-from-interstate-overpass-injures-woman-in-car/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=WNEP|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite news|title=395 reports of yobs throwing rocks from motorway bridges is tip of iceberg|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/395-reports-of-yobs-throwing-rocks-1675875|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Daily Mirror|date=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malaga&gt;{{cite news|title=Man arrested for throwing rocks from A7 Motorway|url=http://www.euroweeklynews.com/news/costa-de-almeria/item/90619-man-arrested-for-throwing-rocks-from-a7-motorway|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Euro Weekly News|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Austin, Texas police detective Jarrett Crippen "When we’re talking about highway speeds of 60, 70 mph, that rock is hitting you full-force...

Thrown rocks can kill in a number of ways; a rock can hit a passenger directly in the head with [[deadly force|lethal force]], a rock can strike the driver causing him or her to lose control of the car and crash, the "jolt and shock of a barrage of stones smashing against the front windshield" can cause the driver to lose control and crash, or the out of control vehicle can slam into a passing car, causing it to crash.&lt;ref name=Medoff&gt;[[Rafael Medoff]], [http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/5/3/baltimore-riot-mom-needed-in-jerusalem#.VUmBPY6qqko= 'Baltimore ‘riot mom’ needed in Jerusalem,'] [[JNS.org]] 3 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[William Blackstone]] stated that throwing stones in a town or city on a highway, when it caused a death, was to be defined as [[manslaughter]] rather than murder.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[William Blackstone]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiJAtfLSg_sC&amp;pg=PA174 ''A Summary of the Constitutional Laws of England Being an Abridgement of Blackstone's Commentaries,''] John Trusler 1796 pp.175-176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Burnett, Robert Craigie [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNRLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 ''A treatise on various branches of the criminal law of Scotland,''] Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1811 p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notorious and deadly riots have begun with rock throwing, or included rock throwing as violence escalated, including the Toronto [[Jubilee riots]], the [[Boston Massacre]], and the [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots]] in the Ukraine.

===Kashmir===
{{Main|Stone Pelting in Kashmir}}
{{see also|2018 Shopian firing incident}}
Throwing of stones at Indian Armed Forces and Police is frequent in the Indian province of [[Kashmir]]. Usually carried out by youths, in the local language it is called "Kanni Jung", which means ''fighting with stones'' and the stone pelters are called as ''Sangbaaz''.&lt;ref name="theanalystworld1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanalystworld.com/stone-pelting-and-kashmiri-youth/ |title=Stone Pelting and Kashmiri Youth |publisher=The Analyst World |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are claims that the rocks are thrown in response to killings of Kashmiri youth at the hands of forces.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/Understanding-Kashmirs-stone-pelters/article16120870.ece |title=Understanding Kashmir's stone pelters |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as per the [[Dailymail]], [[India Today]] Television's underground reporters interviewed some of the stonepelters where stonepelters revealed they are being paid 5000-7000 rupees per month and are being given some clothes and shoes by the Anti-India forces for pelting stones on Indian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-4362020/Kashmiri-stone-pelters-admit-paid-film.html|title=This is our bread and butter': Undercover reporters film Kashmiri 'stone-pelters' admit to being paid Rs 7,000 a month for throwing stones and Molotovs at Indian forces|author=Jamshed Khan, Sushant Pathak|date=29 March 2017|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal background===
Rock throwing has been in the past often adopted as a method by an unarmed population to protest a governing power's authority. Under English [[common law]], soldiers were not permitted to shoot at civilians engaged in this kind of protest, unless their lives were in danger or they obtained beforehand an express order from a civil magistrate. &lt;blockquote&gt;At one point, when town officials tried to arrest a British officer who was commanding the guard at Boston Neck, Captain Ponsonby Molesworth intervened to confront a stone-throwing crowd. Molesworth ordered the soldiers to bayonet anyone throwing stones who got too close. A Boston justice told him that, under common law, a bayonet thrust was not an act of self-defense against a stone, which was not a lethal weapon. Had a soldier killed anyone, Molesworth could have been tried for his life.'&lt;ref&gt;John Murrin, Paul Johnson, James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5_Y2LhgrpToC&amp;pg=PA183 : ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People,''] Cengage Learning, 2011 p.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==At people==

Rock-throwing can be used by thieves, as demonstrated by a 2015 case in India in which Ratan Marwadi (45) was charged with throwing rocks at a random passer-by, Darshana Pawar, for the purpose of disabling and robbing her. Pawar was killed. Her murderer, Ratan Marwadi, had previously served time in jail for pelting rail commuters with stones with the intent of robbing them.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gupta|first1=Pradeep|title=Stone-thrower held for death of commuter|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Stone-thrower-held-for-death-of-commuter/articleshow/46363646.cms|accessdate=18 September 2015|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===

In the 19th century, "stone throwing" was defined as a "nuisance", one of a number of offenses such as "kite-flying" and "doorbell ringing" to be handled by bylaws which differed from town to town.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sturdy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITR_04uCbHkC&amp;pg=PA194 ''Medicine, Health and the Public Sphere in Britain, 1600-2000,''] Routledge 2013 p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Lonnie Swartz, José Rodríguez border incident}}
Rock-throwers on the Mexican side of the border between the United States and Mexico frequently target [[United States Border Patrol]] agents with barrages of rocks to prevent them from apprehending individuals illegally crossing the border, particularly smugglers moving illegal drugs or illegal migrants across the border.&lt;ref name=Medrano&gt;{{cite news|last1=Medrano|first1=Lourdes|title=Bullets vs. rocks?

===Spain - Morocco===

In recent years, increasing numbers of undocumented sub-Saharan Africans have passed through Morocco attempting to reach European Union countries, many attempt to enter Spanish soil at two Spanish enclaves, [[Melilla]] and [[Ceuta]], located on the African side of the Mediterranean Sea.

Stone throwing rioters have repeatedly clashed with Egyptian troops at the [[Egypt-Gaza border]].
* In 2008, Gazans assaulted Egyptian border guards by throwing barrages of rocks over the low, concrete border wall topped with barbed wire, then tore down a section of the wall, opening a road and moving goods and people across for several hours before the Egyptian Army, avoiding the use of lethal force, managed to regain control of the border.&lt;ref name=Erlanger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erlanger|first1=Steven|title=Egypt Tries to Plug Border; Gazans Poke New Hole|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/world/middleeast/26gaza.html|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sub-orbital spaceflight''' is a [[spaceflight]] in which the [[spacecraft]] reaches [[outer space]], but its [[trajectory]] intersects the [[atmosphere]] or surface of the [[primary (astronomy)|gravitating body]] from which it was launched, so that it will not complete one [[orbit]]al revolution.

For example, the path of an object launched from [[Earth]] that reaches the [[Kármán line]] (at {{cvt|100|km|mi|0}} above [[sea level]]), and then falls back to Earth, is considered a sub-orbital spaceflight. Some sub-orbital flights have been undertaken to test spacecraft and [[launch vehicle]]s later intended for [[orbital spaceflight]]. Other vehicles are specifically designed only for sub-orbital flight; examples include manned vehicles, such as the [[North American X-15|X-15]] and [[SpaceShipOne]], and unmanned ones, such as [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] and [[sounding rocket]]s.

Flights which attain sufficient velocity to go into [[low Earth orbit]], and then [[de-orbit]] before completing their first full orbit, are not considered sub-orbital. Examples of this include [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s [[Vostok 1]], and flights of the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]].

Usually a rocket is used, but experimental sub-orbital spaceflight has also been achieved with a [[space gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/fam/martlet.htm |title=Martlet |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926022558/http://www.astronautix.com/fam/martlet.htm |archive-date=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Altitude requirement==
[[Image:Newton Cannon.svg|thumb|right|[[Newton's cannonball|Isaac Newton's Cannonball]]. Paths A and B depict a sub-orbital trajectory.]]
By one definition a sub-orbital spaceflight reaches an [[altitude]] higher than {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. This altitude, known as the Kármán line, was chosen by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] because it is roughly the point where a [[vehicle]] flying fast enough to support itself with [[aerodynamic lift]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere]] would be flying faster than [[orbital speed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/icare-records/100km-altitude-boundary-for-astronautics|title=100 km Altitude Boundary for Astronautics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/618QHms8h?url=http://www.fai.org/astronautics/100km.asp|archive-date=2011-08-22|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military and NASA award [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]] to those flying above {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2005/05-57.html|title=X-15 Space Pioneers Now Honored as Astronauts|first=Mary|last=Whelan|date=5 June 2013|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611194526/https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2005/05-57.html|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[U.S. State Department]] appears to not support a distinct boundary between atmospheric flight and [[spaceflight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/22718.htm|title=85.

==Orbit==
During [[freefall]] the trajectory is part of an [[elliptic orbit]] as given by the [[orbit equation]]. The [[perigee]] distance is less than the [[radius of the Earth]] ''R'' including atmosphere, hence the [[ellipse]] intersects the Earth, and hence the spacecraft will fail to complete an orbit. The major axis is vertical, the [[semi-major axis]] ''a'' is more than ''R''/2. The [[specific orbital energy]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = -{\mu \over{2a}} &gt; -{\mu \over{R}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]].

Almost always ''a'' &lt; ''R'', corresponding to a lower &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; than the minimum for a full orbit, which is &lt;math&gt;-{\mu \over{2R}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the net extra specific energy needed compared to just raising the spacecraft into space is between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\mu \over{2R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

==Speed, range and altitude==
To minimize the required [[delta-v]] (an [[astrodynamics|astrodynamical]] measure which strongly determines the required [[fuel]]), the high-altitude part of the flight is made with the [[rocket]]s off (this is technically called free-fall even for the upward part of the trajectory). (Compare with [[Oberth effect]].) The maximum [[speed]] in a flight is attained at the lowest altitude of this free-fall trajectory, both at the start and at the end of it.

If one's goal is simply to "reach space", for example in competing for the [[Ansari X Prize]], horizontal motion is not needed. In this case the lowest required delta-v, to reach 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude, is about 1.4&amp;nbsp;[[km/s]]. Moving slower, with less free-fall, would require more delta-v.

Compare this with orbital spaceflights: a low Earth orbit (LEO), with an altitude of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, needs a speed around 7.7&amp;nbsp;km/s, requiring a delta-v of about 9.2&amp;nbsp;km/s. (If there were no atmospheric drag the theoretical minimum delta-v would be 8.1&amp;nbsp;km/s to put a craft into a 300-km high orbit starting from a stationary point like the South Pole. The theoretical minimum can be up to 0.46&amp;nbsp;km/s less if launching eastward from near the equator.)

For sub-orbital spaceflights covering a horizontal distance the maximum speed and required delta-v are in between those of a vertical flight and a LEO. The maximum speed at the lower ends of the trajectory are now composed of a horizontal and a vertical component. The higher the horizontal [[distance]] covered, the greater the horizontal speed will be. (The vertical velocity will increase with distance for short distances but will decrease with distance at longer distances.) For the [[V-2 rocket]], just reaching space but with a range of about 330&amp;nbsp;km, the maximum speed was 1.6&amp;nbsp;km/s. [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo]] which is under development will have a similar free-fall orbit but the announced maximum speed is 1.1&amp;nbsp;km/s (perhaps because of engine shut-off at a higher altitude).

For larger ranges, due to the elliptic orbit the maximum altitude can be much more than for a LEO. On a 10,000-km intercontinental flight, such as that of an intercontinental ballistic missile or possible future [[commercial spaceflight]], the maximum speed is about 7&amp;nbsp;km/s, and the maximum altitude may be more than 1300&amp;nbsp;km.
Any [[spaceflight]] that returns to the surface, including sub-orbital ones, will undergo [[atmospheric reentry]]. The speed at the start of the reentry is basically the maximum speed of the flight. The [[aerodynamic heating]] caused will vary accordingly: it is much less for a flight with a maximum speed of only 1&amp;nbsp;km/s than for one with a maximum speed of 7 or 8&amp;nbsp;km/s.

We can calculate the minimum delta-v and the corresponding maximum altitude for a given range, ''d'', assuming a spherical earth of circumference 40 000&amp;nbsp;km and neglecting the earth's rotation and atmosphere. Let θ be half the angle that the projectile is to go around the earth, so in degrees it is 45°×''d''/10 000&amp;nbsp;km. The minimum-delta-v trajectory corresponds to an ellipse with one focus at the centre of the earth and the other at the point halfway between the launch point and the destination point (somewhere inside the earth). (This is the orbit that minimizes the semi-major axis, which is equal to the sum of the distances from a point on the orbit to the two foci. Minimizing the semi-major axis minimizes the [[specific orbital energy]] and thus the delta-v, which is the speed of launch.) Geometrical arguments lead then to the following (with ''R'' being the radius of the earth, about 6370&amp;nbsp;km):

&lt;math&gt;\text{major axis}=(1+\sin\theta)R&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{minor axis}=R\sqrt{2(\sin\theta+\sin^2\theta)}=\sqrt{(R\sin\theta)\text{semi-major axis}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{distance of apogee from centre of earth}=(1+\sin\theta+\cos\theta)R/2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{altitude of apogee above surface}=\left(\frac{\sin\theta}2-\sin^2\frac\theta 2\right)R=\left(\frac{\sin(\theta+\pi/4)}\sqrt{2}-\frac 1 2\right)R&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the altitude of apogee is maximized (at about 1320&amp;nbsp;km) for a trajectory going one quarter of the way around the earth (10 000&amp;nbsp;km). Longer ranges will have lower apogees in the minimal-delta-v solution.

&lt;math&gt;\text{specific kinetic energy at launch}=\frac\mu R-\frac\mu\text{major axis}=\frac\mu R\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta v=\text{speed at launch}=\sqrt{2\frac\mu R\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}=\sqrt{2gR\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

(where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface). We see that the Δv increases with range, leveling off at 7.9&amp;nbsp;km/s as the range approaches 20 000&amp;nbsp;km (halfway around the world). The minimum-delta-v trajectory for going halfway around the world corresponds to a circular orbit just above the surface (of course in reality it would have to be above the atmosphere). See lower for the time of flight.

An [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] is defined as a missile that can hit a target at least 5500&amp;nbsp;km away, and according to the above formula this requires an initial speed of 6.1&amp;nbsp;km/s. Increasing the speed to 7.9&amp;nbsp;km/s to attain any point on Earth requires a considerably larger missile because the amount of fuel needed goes up exponentially with delta-v (see [[Rocket equation]]).

The initial direction of a minimum-delta-v trajectory points halfway between straight up and straight toward the destination point (which is below the horizon). Again, this is the case if we ignore the earth's rotation. It is not exactly true for a rotating planet unless the launch takes place at a pole.

==Flight duration==
In a vertical flight of not too high altitudes, the time of the free-fall is both for the upward and for the downward part the maximum speed divided by the [[Standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]], so with a maximum speed of 1&amp;nbsp;km/s together 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The duration of the [[flight]] phases before and after the free-fall can vary.

For an intercontinental flight the [[boost phase]] takes 3 to 5 minutes, the free-fall (midcourse phase) about 25 minutes. For an ICBM the atmospheric reentry phase takes about 2 minutes; this will be longer for any soft landing, such as for a possible future commercial flight.

Sub-orbital flights can last many hours. [[Pioneer 1]] was [[NASA]]'s first [[space probe]], intended to reach the [[Moon]]. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a sub-orbital trajectory, reentering the Earth's atmosphere 43 hours after launch.

To calculate the time of flight for a minimum-delta-v trajectory, we first find that, according to [[Kepler's third law]], the period for the entire orbit (if it didn't go through the earth) would be:

&lt;math&gt;\text{period}=(\text{semi-major axis}/R)^{3/2}\times\text{period of low earth orbit}=\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}2\right)^{3/2}2\pi\sqrt{R/g}&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Kepler's second law]], we multiply this by the portion of the area of the ellipse swept by the line from the centre of the earth to the projectile:

&lt;math&gt;\text{area fraction}=\frac{\arcsin\sqrt{\frac{2\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}}\pi+\frac{2\cos\theta\sin\theta}{\pi\text{(major axis)(minor axis)}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{time of flight}&amp;=\left(\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}2\right)^{3/2}\arcsin\sqrt{\frac{2\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}+\frac 1 2\cos\theta\sqrt{\sin\theta}\right)2\sqrt\frac R g\\
&amp;=\left(\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}2\right)^{3/2}\arccos\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\sin\theta}+\frac 1 2\cos\theta\sqrt{\sin\theta}\right)2\sqrt\frac R g\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives about 32 minutes for going a quarter of the way around the earth, and 42 minutes for going halfway around. For short distances, this expression is [[asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2d/g}&lt;/math&gt;.

As one can see from the form involving arccosine, the derivative of the time of flight with respect to ''d'' (or θ) goes to zero as ''d'' approaches 20 000&amp;nbsp;km (halfway around the world). The derivative of Δv also goes to zero here. So if ''d'' = 19 000&amp;nbsp;km, the length of the minimum-delta-v trajectory will be about 19 500&amp;nbsp;km, but it will take only a few seconds less time than the trajectory for ''d'' = 20 000&amp;nbsp;km (for which the trajectory is 20 000&amp;nbsp;km long).

==Flight profiles==

[[File:Mr3-flight-timeline-simple.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Profile for the first manned American sub-orbital flight, 1961. Launch rocket lifts the spacecraft for the first 2:22 minutes. Dashed line: zero gravity.]]
While there are a great many possible sub-orbital flight profiles, it is expected that some will be more common than others.

[[File:X-15.jpg|thumb|The X-15 (1958–68) would lift itself to an altitude of approximately 100 km and then glide down.]]

===Ballistic missiles===
The first sub-orbital vehicles which reached space were [[ballistic missiles]]. The very first ballistic missile to reach space was the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], the work of the scientists at [[Peenemünde]], on October 3, 1942 which reached an altitude of {{convert|60|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Germany's V-2 Rocket, Kennedy, Gregory P.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the late 1940s the USA and [[USSR]] concurrently developed missiles all of which were based on the V-2 Rocket, and then much longer range Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). There are now many countries who possess ICBMs and even more with shorter range [[IRBM]]s (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles).

===Tourist flights===
[[Space tourism|Sub-orbital tourist flights]] will initially focus on attaining the altitude required to qualify as reaching space. The flight path will probably be either vertical or very steep, with the spacecraft landing back at its take-off site.

The spacecraft will probably shut off its [[engine]]s well before reaching maximum altitude, and then coast up to its highest point. During a few minutes, from the point when the engines are shut off to the point where the atmosphere begins to slow down the downward acceleration, the passengers will experience [[weightlessness]].

[[Megaroc]] had been planned for sub-orbital spaceflight by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|title=How a Nazi rocket could have put a Briton in space|first=Richard|last=Hollingham|date=|website=bbc.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114032515/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|title=Megaroc|author=|date=|website=www.bis-space.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030133900/http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|archivedate=30 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1945, the group M. Tikhonravov K. and N. G. Chernysheva at NII-4 rocket artillery Academy of Sciences technology on its own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project was developed by [[Project BP-190|BP-190]] for vertical flight two pilots to an altitude of 200&amp;nbsp;km based on captured German ballistic rocket [[V-2 rocket|V-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Anatoli I.

In 2004, a number of companies worked on vehicles in this class as entrants to the Ansari X Prize competition. The [[Scaled Composites]] [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] was officially declared by [[Richard A. Searfoss|Rick Searfoss]] to have won the competition on October 4, 2004 after completing two flights within a two-week period.

In 2005, [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]] of the [[Virgin Group]] announced the creation of [[Virgin Galactic]] and his plans for a 9-seat capacity SpaceShipTwo named [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise'']]. It has since been completed with eight seats (one pilot, one co-pilot and six passengers) and has taken part in captive-carry tests and with the first mother-ship [[WhiteKnightTwo]], or [[VMS Eve]]. It has also completed solitary glides, with the movable tail sections in both fixed and "feathered" configurations.  The [[hybrid rocket]] motor has been fired multiple times in ground-based test stands, and was fired in a powered flight for the second time on 5 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scaled.com/projects/test_logs/35/model_339_spaceshiptwo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816140953/http://www.scaled.com/projects/test_logs/35/model_339_spaceshiptwo |archivedate=2013-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four additional SpaceShipTwos have been ordered and will operate from the new [[Spaceport America]]. Commercial flights carrying passengers were expected in 2014, but became cancelled due to the [[VSS Enterprise crash|disaster during SS2 PF04 flight]]. Branson stated, "[w]e are going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forwards together."&lt;ref&gt;"Branson on Virgin Galactic crash: 'Space is hard – but worth it'". CNET. Retrieved August 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific experiments===
A major use of sub-orbital vehicles today are as [[scientific]] [[sounding rocket]]s. Scientific sub-orbital flights began in the 1920s when [[Robert H. Goddard]] launched the first [[liquid fuel]]ed rockets, however they did not reach [[space]] altitude. In the late 1940s, captured German [[V-2 rocket|V-2 ballistic missiles]] were converted into [[V-2 sounding rocket]]s which helped lay the foundation for modern sounding rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ch2|url = https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4401/ch2.htm|website = history.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151129091504/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4401/ch2.htm|archivedate = 2015-11-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are dozens of different sounding rockets on the market, from a variety of suppliers in various countries. Typically, researchers wish to conduct experiments in [[microgravity]] or above the atmosphere.

===Sub-orbital transportation===
Research, such as that done for the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] project suggests that a semi-ballistic sub-orbital flight could travel from Europe to North America in less than an hour.

However, the size of rocket, relative to the payload, necessary to achieve this, is similar to an ICBM. ICBMs have delta-v's somewhat less than orbital; and therefore would be somewhat cheaper than the costs for reaching orbit, but the difference is not large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1118/1|title=The Space Review: Point-to-point suborbital transportation: sounds good on paper, but…|author=|date=|website=www.thespacereview.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801074751/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1118/1|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus due to the high cost, this is likely to be initially limited to high value, very high urgency cargo such as [[courier]] flights, or as the ultimate [[business jet]]; or possibly as an [[extreme sport]], or for [[military]] fast-response.{{opinion|date=April 2012}}

The [[SpaceLiner]] is a hypersonic [[suborbital spaceplane]] concept that could transport 50 passengers from [[Australia]] to [[Europe]] in 90 minutes or 100 passengers from Europe to [[California]] in 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576510000445| author = Sippel, M. | title = Promising roadmap alternatives for the SpaceLiner |publisher = Acta Astronautica |issue = 11–12 |volume = 66 |date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main challenge lies in increasing the reliability of the different components, particularly the engines, in order to make their use for passenger transportation on a daily basis possible.

[[SpaceX]] is planning to use its [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] launch vehicle as a sub-orbital point-to-point transport.

==Notable unmanned sub-orbital spaceflights==
* The first sub-orbital space flight was in June 1944, when [[MW 18014|a V-2 test rocket]] launched from [[Peenemünde]] in Germany reached 189 kilometres altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dornberger, Moewig, Berlin 1984. {{ISBN|3-8118-4341-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bumper (rocket)|Bumper]] 5, a two-stage rocket launched from the [[White Sands Proving Grounds]]. On 24 February 1949 the upper stage reached an altitude of {{convert|248|mi|km}} and a speed of 7,553 [[feet per second]] (2300 meters per second approx.)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/bump.htm | title = Bumper Project | publisher = White Sands Missile Range | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110163113/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/bump.htm | archivedate = 2008-01-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is nearly Mach-7.
* USSR — [[Energia]], 1986, [[Polyus (spacecraft)|Polyus]] payload failed to reach orbit; this was the most massive object launched into sub-orbital spaceflight to date

==Future of manned sub-orbital spaceflight==
[[Private companies]] such as [[Virgin Galactic]], [[XCOR]], [[Armadillo Aerospace]] (reinvented as Exos Aerospace), [[Airbus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27686906|title=Airbus drops model 'space jet'|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|date=3 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504004642/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27686906|archivedate=4 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Blue Origin]] and [[Masten Space Systems]] are taking an interest in sub-orbital spaceflight, due in part to ventures like the Ansari X Prize. NASA and others are experimenting with [[scramjet]] based [[hypersonic]] aircraft which may well be used with flight profiles that qualify as sub-orbital spaceflight. [[Non-profit]] entities like [[ARCASPACE]] and [[Copenhagen Suborbitals]] also attempt [[rocket]]-based launches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">The discourses in philosophy regarding [[social relation]]. What [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] call "the principle of '''superficiality''' versus depth"&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 18-9&lt;/ref&gt; has pervaded [[Western culture]] since at least the time of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 71 and p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical sketch==

[[Socrates]] sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Morgan, ''Myth and Philosophy from the pre-Socratics to Plato'' (2000) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; founded (as [[Plato]] at least considered) upon the underlying [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]]. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Gladstein/C. M. Sicabarra, ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'' (1999) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The salon style of the [[Précieuses]] might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion;&lt;ref&gt;A. De Riencout, ''Sex and Power in History'' (1974) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cusset, ''No Tomorrow'' (1996) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; or the changing vagaries of fashion&lt;ref&gt;G. D. McCracken, ''Transformations'' (2008) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.

==Modernist cross-currents==

By contrast, [[Nietzsche]] opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: "What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – ''out of profundity''!".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory Castle, ''The Blackwell Guide to Theory'' (OxfordLiteraryironic 2007) p.&lt;/ref&gt;

His (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by [[modernism]]'s full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. [[Frederic Jameson]] has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a ''deeper'' reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic -  in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bennett/N. Royle, ''An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory'' (2004) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new [[cult]] of the image and the [[simulacrum]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 17 and p 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodernism==

In the last third of the 20th century, [[Lyotard]] began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a ''theatrical'' world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;K. Chrome/J. Williams ed., ''The Lyotard Reader and Guide'' (2006) p. 24-8&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[deconstruction]] has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth.&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991) p. 2 and p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

That process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously "surface was depth",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bracewell, ''The Nineties: when surface was depth'' (London 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In this new era of exposure&lt;ref&gt;L. Magid/A. Collier, ''Myspace'' (2007) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called "the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

If postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial&lt;ref&gt;Russell De Manning, ''Theology at the End of Culture'' (2005) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; - critics like [[J. G. Ballard]] object that the end-product is a world of "laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows":&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Ballard, ''Millennium People'' (London 2003) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the [[false consciousness]] of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the [[zapping]] mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.&lt;ref&gt;David Edwards, ''Burning All Illusions'' (1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

Almost all [[Depth psychology|depth psychologies]] defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]]'s words, for "change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Debates may rage over whether to ''begin'' analysis at the surface or by way of  deep interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example [[Jung]]ians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the ''[[Persona (psychology)|persona-restoring]]'' phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedgwick, ''Introduction to Jungian Psychotherapy'' (2006) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] by contrast maintained that "the simplicity of the [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (1972) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the [[Freud Wars]] of [[late modernity]], in which, according to [[Jonathan Lear]], "the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lear, in Parsons, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Given a choice of surface or depth—"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?"—he asks: "Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life";&lt;ref&gt;Lear, in Parsons, p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.

==Social processing==

[[Social psychology]] considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on [[First impression (psychology)|first impressions]] and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 18 and p. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade''  (London 1972) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; and use [[ideal type]]s/[[stereotypes]] to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of [[groupthink]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; to preclude deeper investigation.

Some circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
* Entertainer [[Bill Hicks]] often criticized [[consumerism]], superficiality, mediocrity, and banality within the media and [[popular culture]], describing them as oppressive tools of the ruling class, meant to "keep people stupid and apathetic."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8409129199157823217 "Bill Hicks on Austin Public Access"], October 24, 1993, via Vide.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Web 2.0#Criticism|Web 2.0]] in particular is often seen as specifically fostering superficiality, replacing deep, measured analysis by noisy but unfiltered observation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Keen, ''The Cult of the Amateur'' (2008) p. 16 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' is his examination of American culture, particularly what he saw as its [[narcissism]], superficiality, and obsession with youth. [[Freud]] had similarly explored what was at the start of the 20th century a conventional contrast between the (historical) depth of Europe and the superficiality of America;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; but towards the century's close, another European, [[Baudrillard]], would return to the image of America as a shallow, cultureless desert, only to praise it in postmodern terms "because you are delivered from all depths there – a brilliant, mobile, superficial neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stuart Sim ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (London 2001) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' has been analysed in terms of the movement from the superficiality of [[Elizabeth Bennet]]'s initially favourable appraisal of Whickham – her first impressions – to her deeper realisation of the value of Mr Darcy.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Tanner, 'Introduction', Jane Austen, ''Pride and Prejudice'' (Penguin 1972) p. 11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">A '''swim lane''' (or '''swim lane diagram''') is used in [[flowchart|process flow diagram]]s, or flowcharts, that visually distinguishes [[job sharing]] and responsibilities for sub-processes of a [[business process]]. Swim lanes may be arranged either horizontally or vertically. 
[[File:Approvals.svg|thumb|Swim lane flowchart.  Here, the swim lanes are named Customer, Sales, Contracts, Legal, and Fulfillment, and are arranged vertically.
]]

==Attributes of a swim lane==
The swim lane flowchart differs from other flowcharts in that processes and decisions are grouped visually by placing them in ''lanes''. Parallel lines divide the chart into lanes, with one lane for each person, group or sub process. Lanes are labelled to show how the chart is organized.

In the accompanying example, the vertical direction represents the sequence of events in the overall process, while the horizontal divisions depict what sub-process is performing that step.  Arrows between the lanes represent how information or material is passed between the sub processes.

Alternately, the flow can be rotated so that the sequence reads horizontally from left to right, with the roles involved being shown at the left edge.  This can be easier to read and design, since computer screens are typically wider than they are tall, which gives an improved view of the flow.

Use of standard symbols enables clear linkage to be shown between related flow charts when charting flows with complex relationships.

==Usage==
When used to diagram a business process that involves more than one department, swimlanes often serve to clarify not only the steps and who is responsible for each one, but also how delays, mistakes or cheating are most likely to occur.

Many process modeling methodologies utilize the concept of swim lanes, as a mechanism to organize activities into separate visual categories in order to illustrate different functional capabilities or responsibilities (organisational [[role]]s). Swim lanes are used in [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN) and  [[Unified Modeling Language]]  [[activity diagram]] modeling methodologies.

==Alternative terms==
A swim lane may also be referred to as a '''functional band''' (as it is in [[Microsoft Visio]] 2007) and is used in the same way, to create a cross functional flowchart to map a process within the functional units of a business.&lt;ref name="FunctionalBand"&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/create-a-cross-functional-flowchart-HP010357078.aspx Create a cross-functional flowchart, Microsoft Office Visio Help]&lt;/ref&gt; The term functional band precedes the use of swim lane and is seemingly in decline as the preferred term.

==Origin==
Swim lane diagrams first appeared in the 1940s as a variation of the flow process chart called multi-column charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worksimp.com/articles/processcharting.pdf?pdf=1945-Process-Charting&lt;/ref&gt; They were called Swim Lane diagrams by Geary Rummler and Alan Brache in their book Improving Performance (1990). Swim lanes are also known as "Rummler-Brache Diagrams".
Another possible origin of the term swim lane is as part of the  JBoss jBPM jPDL (Process Definition Language) graphical process designer a part of the JBoss jBPM framework for process languages.&lt;ref name="JBossjBPMjPDL"&gt;[http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v3/userguide/jpdl.html#swimlane.element Chapter 18. jBPM Process Definition Language – Swimlane]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swim Lane presentation was developed in the early 1980s by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Binner as part of his doctoral thesis on the requirements of the IT and CIM concept at the Institute for Factory Facilities at Prof. Wiendahl at TU-Hannover.

A process model was developed in which the role-based process analysis and modeling was the starting point for the IT-based IT solution or, in the case, the CIM solution with which the development of an IT-CIM concept was possible.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Analysis of Verbal Behavior''''' ('''''TAVB''''') is a [[scientific journal]] that was established in 1982 as a peer-reviewed psychology journal. It publishes research in conceptual and empirical analysis of verbal behavior and problems of social importance.&lt;ref&gt;Eshleman, J.W. (1991). Quantified trends in the history of verbal Behavior research. ''The Analysis of Verbal Behavior'', 9, 61–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was created by Mark Sundberg in 1982 after he completed his PhD at [[Western Michigan University]] in 1980. TAVB was previously a newsletter called the ''VB Newsletters'' and no publications appeared in 1984.

===Editorship===
The current editor (2012) is [[Anna I. Pétursdóttir]] PhD, Texas Christian University, Fort Worth.

==Importance of the journal==
{{quote|[...] even though one may be able to do good works without talking about it correctly, I can't help but believe that even better works are possible when verbal practices are not seriously flawed.|[[Jack Michael]]&lt;ref&gt;Jack Michael (1986). Repertoire-altering effects of remote contingencies. ''The Analysis of Verbal Behavior'', 4, 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* The journal is indexed, in [[PsycINFO]] and it is published yearly by the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]] (ABAI). It typically publishes 10–20 articles per year. Its ISSN is 08889-9401.
* TAVB is a [[delayed open access journal]]: recent reprints, volume 22, 2006 onwards, are available free from ABAI. From 1982 to 2000 TAVB has published 150 articles in Experimental Analysis of Behavior, Applied Behavior Analysis, and Conceptual Behavior Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew P. Normand, Jeffrey F. Fossa, and Alan Poling (2000) Publication Trends in The Analysis of Verbal Behavior: 1982–1998. ''The Analysis of Verbal Behavior'', 17, 167–173&lt;/ref&gt; TAVB features scientific articles on the various functions of language such as [[mand (psychology)|mand]], [[tact (psychology)|tact]], [[verbal behavior|intraverbals]], [[listener behavior]] and [[rule-governed behavior]], [[autoclitics]], [[multiple control]], [[private events]], [[epistemology]], [[language acquisition]], [[language assessment]] and training, [[second language]]s, [[pedagogy]], the verbal behavior of nonhumans, verbal behavior [[research methodology]], and the history of verbal behavior analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2682">The '''three-term contingency''' (also known as the '''ABC contingency''') in [[operant conditioning]] describes the relationship between a behavior, its consequence, and the environmental context. The three-term contingency was first defined by [[B. F. Skinner]] in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191686|title=Science and human behavior|author=Skinner, B. F. (Burrhus Frederic)|date=1953|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0029290406|location=New York,|oclc=191686}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used within [[Applied behavior analysis|ABA]] to alter the frequency of socially significant human behavior.  

== Components ==

=== Antecedent ===
The antecedent stimulus occurs first in the contingency and signals that reinforcement or punishment is available on the contingency of a specific behavior. A [[Discriminative stimulus|discriminative stimuli]], or S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, directly affects the likelihood of a specific response occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51566296|title=Behavior analysis and learning|last=David.|first=Pierce, W.|date=2004|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|others=Cheney, Carl D.|isbn=9780805844894|edition=3rd|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=51566296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior ===
The [[behavior]], also referred to as the response, is any observable and measurable action a living organism can do. In the three-term contingency, behavior is operant, meaning it changes the environment in some way.  

=== Consequence ===
[[File:Operant conditioning diagram rev.svg|thumb|Diagram of consequences in operant conditioning]]
The consequence to a behavior can be reinforcing or punishing. [[Reinforcement|Reinforcing]] consequences increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future; it is further divided into positive and negative reinforcement. [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishing]] consequences decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future; like reinforcement, it is divided into positive and negative punishment.

The effectiveness and value of a consequence is determined by the [[Motivating operation|motivating operations]] the organism has. For example, deprivation of food can make food more effective as a consequence, and the satiation of hunger can make food less effective as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74942760|title=Applied behavior analysis|last=O.|first=Cooper, John|date=2007|publisher=Pearson/Merrill-Prentice Hall|others=Heron, Timothy E., Heward, William L., 1949-|isbn=0131421131|edition=2nd|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=74942760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4435">'''Transarmament''' (closely related to [[civilian-based defense]]) is the partial or total replacement of [[armed forces]] with the physical and social infrastructure to support [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] resistance. According to an encyclopedia definition, transarmament is
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the process of changeover from a military-based defense policy to a [[civilian-based defense]] policy. Transarmament always involves the replacement of one means to provide defense with another. It therefore differs from "disarmament," which is the simple reduction or abandonment of military capacity. (p&amp;nbsp;534&lt;ref name=sharp97&gt;[[Gene Sharp]] (1997). "Transarmament" (p. 534) in: Roger S. Powers, William B. Vogele, Christopher Kruegler, Ronald M. McCarthy (1997), ''Protest, power, and change: an encyclopedia of nonviolent action from ACT-UP to women's suffrage''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-0913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Civilian defense==
The term "transarmament" appears to have been introduced in 1937 in a pamphlet by [[Kenneth Boulding]].&lt;ref name=sharp97/&gt; It appears not to have been used again until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=sharp97/&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts68&gt;Adam Roberts (ed.) (1968), ''Civilian resistance as a national defense: non-violent action against aggression''. Stackpole Books. (320 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Adam Roberts,
:At least four possible stages &lt;nowiki&gt;[of transarmament]&lt;/nowiki&gt; can be envisaged:
:1. Research and investigation into civilian defence, in order to judge its workability, relate it to a specific country's defence problems, and develop strategic and tactical concepts so that the proposal can be presented in concrete and practical terms.
:2. General public education in non-violent action and civilian defence; concentrated training of key groups and individuals; organizational preparations.
:3. Application of civilian defence in specific areas without complete abandonment of military defence policy.
:4. Public commitment to use civilian defence in resisting all threats formerly dealt with by military methods. Completion of process of transarment. (p.&amp;nbsp;338&lt;ref name=robertschap69&gt;Adam Roberts (1969) "Transarmament to Civilian Defence" (pp. 336-348) in Adam Roberts (ed.), "Civilian Resistance as a National Defence," Baltimore, MD: Penguin/Pelican, 1969. (367 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Offensive to defensive==
"Transarmament" has later been used—for example, by [[Johan Galtung]]—as a technical term to describe a shift in military strategy. Galtung distinguishes between offensive and defense armaments and suggests transitioning to a defensive system of national defense. His use of the term does not imply nonviolence.&lt;ref name=galtung84&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12563">'''World disclosure''' ({{lang-de|Erschlossenheit}}, literally "development, comprehension") refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to human beings, by virtue of being part of an [[ontological]] ''world'' – i.e., a pre-interpreted and [[holism|holistically structured]] background of meaning. This understanding is said to be first disclosed to human beings through their practical day-to-day encounters with others, with things in the world, and through language.

The phenomenon was described by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in his landmark book ''[[Being and Time]].'' It has also been discussed by philosophers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "On World Disclosure: Heidegger, Habermas and Dewey," Thesis Eleven, Vol. 37, No. 1, 29-45 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some philosophers, such as [[Ian Hacking]] and [[Nikolas Kompridis]], have also described how this ontological understanding can be ''[[reflective disclosure|re-disclosed]]'' in various ways (including through innovative forms of philosophical [[argument]]).
==First and second order disclosure==

The idea of disclosure supposes that the meaning of a word or thing depends upon the context in which we encounter it, including the way of life of which it is a part. For example, a table is part of a context with other things that give it its sense or purpose – e.g. chairs, food, a teapot, pencils, books – and we first learn about it through our everyday experience of it in particular contexts. Its meaning is "given" to us by virtue of its connection to various activities (e.g. writing, eating, conversation), and by qualities (e.g. conviviality) that give it value in relation to such activities. These constitute part of its "conditions of intelligibility."

The implication is that we are always already "thrown" into these conditions, that is, thrown into a prior understanding of the things  which we encounter on a daily basis – an understanding that is already somewhat meaningful and coherent. However, our understanding cannot be made ''fully'' conscious or knowable at one time, since this background understanding isn't itself an object:

{{cquote|[T]he world is not a possible object of knowledge – because it is not an object at all, not an entity or set of entities. It is that within which entities appear, a field or horizon [that set] the conditions for any intra-worldly relation, and so is not analysable in terms of any such relation.|||Stephen Mulhall, ''Heidegger and Being and Time'', p. 96&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mulhall. ''Heidegger and Being and Time'', Routledge, 1996. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Nikolas Kompridis]], the initial disclosure of an ontological world is said to be "pre-reflective" or '''first-order''' disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', [[MIT Press]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this so-called first-order disclosure is not fixed, as it can vary across historical time and cultural space. As well, Kompridis has described a kind of '''second-order''' or ''[[reflective disclosure]]''. Whereas first-order disclosure involves an implicit, unconscious and largely passive relation to meaning, reflective disclosure is an explicit ''re-working'' of meaning and the terms used to make sense of ourselves and the world, through the "refocusing" or "de-centering" of our understanding. Reflective disclosure is thus a way of acting back upon conditions of intelligibility, in order to clarify or reshape our background understanding. Because of this, reflective disclosure also affects conditions of ''possibility'' by impacting on such basic questions as "what counts as a thing, what counts as true/false, and what it makes sense to do."&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Being and Power: Heidegger and Foucault," in ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 4, 1 (March 1996): 4. cited in Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', MIT Press, 2006. p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

While some philosophers, notably [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Richard Rorty]], claim that disclosure is an [[aesthetic]] phenomenon (supposedly, neither [[reason|rational]] nor [[cognitive]], and therefore not philosophical), disclosive arguments have been employed in many contexts that are not primarily considered literary or "aesthetic," and some philosophers have argued for the importance of disclosure's (not to mention, aesthetics') place in human [[reason]], most notably Nikolas Kompridis and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, "[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=15167 Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future], ''University of Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), 12; 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World-disclosing arguments==

{{Cquote|
All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system. And this system is not a more or less arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments: no, it belongs to the essence of what we call an argument... as the element in which arguments have their life.|||
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''On Certainty'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1975), 107.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

World-disclosing arguments are a family of philosophical [[argument]] described by Nikolas Kompridis in his book ''Critique and Disclosure''.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure'' (MIT Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kompridis, these arguments have distinctive forms, sometimes called ''styles of reasoning'',&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hacking, ''Styles of Scientific Reasoning'', John Rajchman and Cornel West, eds., ''Post-analytic Philosophy'' (New York:Columbia University Press, 1985), pp.145-65.&lt;/ref&gt; that start with a disclosive approach instead of, or in addition to methods that are [[deductive]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;We can use the word "disclosure" for this, following Heidegger. And along with this goes a conception of critical reasoning, of especial relevance for moral thinking, that focuses on the nature of transitions in our thought." Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard, 1995), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[D]eductive, inductive, or abductive [logic does] not count as a style of reasoning. This is as it should be... People everywhere make inductions, draw inferences to the best explanation, make deductions; those are not peculiarly scientific styles of thinking." Ian Hacking, ''Historical Ontology'' (Harvard, 2002), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; According to disclosure theorists, these forms of argument attempt to reveal features of a wider ontological or cultural-linguistic understanding (or "world," in a specifically ontological sense), in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and "logical space" on which an argument implicitly depends.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]hrough a clarification of the conditions of intentionality, we come to a better understanding of what we are as knowing agents – and hence also as language beings – and thereby gain insight into some of the crucial anthropological questions that underpin our moral and spiritual beliefs... What reflection in this direction would entail is already fairly well known. It involves... our being able to articulate the background of our lives perspicuously." Charles Taylor, ''Philosophical Arguments" (Harvard, 1995), 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[World disclosing] arguments cannot assume that the logical space necessary to rendering visible the inferential relations between the premises and the conclusions ''already'' exists; rather, their success depends on the degree to which they can expand existing logical space in order to make room for the conclusions to which they lead." Nikolas Kompridis, "World Disclosing ''Arguments''?" in ''Critique and Disclosure'' (MIT Press, 2006), 119."&lt;/ref&gt; A major example of this type of argument is said to be that of [[immanent critique]], although it is not the only kind.&lt;ref&gt;"[Immanent] critique and reflective disclosure are practically indistinguishable, and that is because they are structurally homologous." Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure'' (MIT Press, 2006), 254-255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In deductive arguments, the "test" of the argument's success are said to be its formal [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[soundness]]. However, in a world-disclosing argument, the primary criterion for success is the solution of a problem that could not be successfully dealt with under some previous understanding or paradigm, for example, after an [[epistemological]] crisis (see [[Paradigm shift]]). It is therefore said to be ''possibility disclosing'' rather than "truth-preserving" or "truth-tracking."&lt;ref&gt;"Since we are not dealing with deductive or inductive styles of reasoning (which are truth-preserving, not possibility disclosing), we cannot know in advance what form [they] will take." Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The "claim" made by such an argument is that of a new insight, resulting from the adoption of a new stance or perspective that reveals, or ''discloses'' a new possibility for thinking and acting.&lt;ref&gt;"[S]uccessful critique depends not just on showing that ''x'' is a disguised effect of ''y'', which effect in turn requires the exclusion or repression of ''r''. For this to be shown in the first place, critique needs to find the normative stance, the new interpretive perspective, in light of which what is familiar is defamiliarized, seen again, as if for the first time." Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure'' (MIT Press, 2006), 254-255. See also "The test of disclosure" in the same volume, 139-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has described two kinds of [[fallibilism]] in this regard. The first consists in being open to new evidence that could disprove some previously held position or belief (the taken-for-granted position of the observer in [[normal science]]). The second refers to the consciousness of "the degree to which our interpretations, valuations, our practices, and traditions are temporally indexed" and subject to historical change. This "time-responsive" (as opposed to "evidence-responsive") fallibilism consists in an ''expectant'' openness to some future possibility. According to Kompridis, world-disclosing arguments are fallible in both senses of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "Two kinds of fallibilism", ''Critique and Disclosure'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major examples of world disclosing arguments in philosophy are said to include:

* [[Transcendental arguments|"Transcendental" arguments]], in which an understanding of some feature of experience is shown to [[logical consequence|logically entail]] certain necessary conceptual pre-suppositions (e.g. Kant's transcendental self; Heidegger's elucidation of ontological being in ''[[Being and Time]]'');
* Dialectical arguments, where the premises argued from are shown to be logically ''weaker'' than the argument's conclusion (e.g. Hegel's [[master-slave dialectic]] and T.W. Adorno's [[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]);
* ''Historical ontologies'', such as those articulated by [[Michel Foucault]] (the historical ontology of power), [[Jacques Derrida]] (the historical ontology of meaning) and philosopher of science [[Ian Hacking]] (scientific revolutions); and
* Forms of argument that, "through the use of [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic arguments]] and creative redescriptions" of our practices and cultural [[paradigms]], re-disclose the background of cultural meaning and "logical space of possibility."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "World Disclosing ''Arguments''?" in ''Critique and Disclosure'', Cambridge:MIT Press (2006), 118-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] who are said to employ world-disclosing arguments include [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].
