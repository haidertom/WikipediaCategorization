This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1599'''.

==Events==
*[[January 13]] – [[Edmund Spenser]] dies in London, followed by burial in the [[Poets' Corner]] at [[Westminster Abbey]].

[[Richard Bancroft]], [[Bishop of London]] and [[John Whitgift]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] tighten their enforcement of existing censorship.

In [[Histriomastix (play)|''Histriomastix'']], Marston satirizes [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]]’s pride through the character Chrisoganus; Jonson responds by satirizing Marstons's wordy style in ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', acted by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].&lt;ref&gt;A reverse sequence of events is argued in: {{cite journal|last=Bednarz|first=James|title=Marston's Subversion of Shakespeare and Jonson: Histriomastix and the War of the Theaters|journal=Medieval &amp; Renaissance Drama in England|volume=6|location=New York|publisher=AMS Press|year=1993|pages=103–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The English comic actor [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]] leaves the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] earlier in the year, to be replaced by [[Robert Armin]] by its end (probably).
*[[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]] arranges for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=S.|last=Carpenter|chapter=Scottish drama until 1650|editor=Brown, I. |title=The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=0748641076|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''1958 in film''' in the US involved some significant events, including the hit musicals ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'' and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''.

==Events==
* January 29 - ''[[Ascenseur pour l'échafaud]]'' is an early example of the [[French New Wave]].  ''[[Le Beau Serge]]'' is credited as the first French New Wave feature.
* February 16 - ''[[In the Money]]'' by William Beaudine is released. It would be the last installment of [[The Bowery Boys]] series which began in 1946.
* February 27 - [[Harry Cohn]], the remaining founder of [[Columbia Pictures]] and one of the last remaining Hollywood movie moguls, dies.
* The second installment of [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'' is officially released, having previously been shelved for political reasons. It would be the last of Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible trilogy as the director died during production on Part III.
* April - [[Samuel J. Briskin]] leaves [[MGM]] and rejoins [[Columbia Pictures]] later becoming Vice President and General Manager of the studio.
* April 22 - [[Sol C. Siegel]] becomes head of studio operations at [[MGM]].
* May 15 - As the twilight of the movie musical was declining from people's interest and taste, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released a film that ended the popularity of movie musicals with dignity, class, eloquence, and respect. Directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], produced by [[Arthur Freed]], and written by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' set a standard for future film musicals on how to appeal to audiences young and old, as well as to be taken seriously as a true art form of  filmmaking (e.g. ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'', to name more acclaimed titles.) ''Gigi'' was released to tremendous critical and commercial success and became the highest-grossing musical ever made by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], until ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' in 1974.
* May 17 - [[Joseph E. Levine]] presents a picture on his own for the first time with 1954's ''[[Attila (1954 film)|Attila]]'' in an all-out exploitation saturation booking in the United States earning rentals of $2 million.
* August 31 - ''[[Carry on Sergeant]]'', the first film in the popular British [[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]] series, opens.
* November 15 - During production of ''[[Solomon and Sheba]]'' in Madrid, Spain, actor [[Tyrone Power]] dies of a massive heart attack.

{{for|the film|Journey Beyond Three Seas}}

'''''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas''''' ({{lang-ru|Хожение за три моря}}, ''Khozheniye za tri morya'') is a [[Russian literature|Russian]] literary monument in the form of travel notes, made by a [[merchant]] from [[Tver]], [[Afanasiy Nikitin]] during his journey to [[India]] in 1466–1472.

''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas'' was the first Russian literary work to depict a strictly [[commerce|commercial]], non-[[religious]] trip. Prior texts were pilgrimage texts, which depicted travel to holy sites and were more standardized, dry and conventional. The author visited the [[Caucasus]], [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], India and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. However, most of the notes are dedicated to India, its political structure, [[trade]], [[agriculture]], [[convention (norm)|custom]]s and ceremonies. The work is full of lyrical [[digression]]s and [[Autobiography|autobiographic]] passages. There is a strong individual, authorial presence. Its last page is in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and the broken [[Arabic language]]; these are, in fact, typical Muslim prayers, indicating that Nikitin might have converted to [[Islam]] while he was in India, although his lapse from Christianity bothered him as he mentions several times in the text.&lt;ref&gt;For a translation of Nikitin's account, see Richard H. Major, ed. "The Travels of Athanasius Nikitin," tr. Mikhail M. Wielhorsky. In India ''in the Fifteenth Century''. Hakluyt Society, ser. 1. volume 22. (London: Hakluyt Society, 1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, however, Nikitin all time prays to [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Theotokos]], Christian Orthodox [[Saints]], tries to observe Christian rites, and so on.
The author did not make his way back to his native land; he died on the trip home. 
In 1475, the [[manuscript]] made its way to [[Moscow]] into the hands of a government official Vasili Mamyrev. Later on, it was incorporated into the [[annals|annalistic]] code of 1489, the [[Sofia Second Chronicle]] and the [[Lvov Chronicle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5460">The '''Center for Hmong Arts and Talent''' ('''CHAT''') is an arts advocacy group based in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]'s [[Frogtown, Saint Paul|Frogtown neighborhood]]. Since its inception in 1998, CHAT has transformed into a social justice arts organization that engages with local and national [[Hmong people|Hmong]] communities. In addition to providing diverse arts-based programs, CHAT uses innovative strategies to address social issues affecting [[Hmong American]]s.

==History==
In the late 1980s, playwright Jaime Meyer worked with Hmong youth to produce ''Hmong Tapestry: Voices from the Cloth''. In 1990, Meyer and director Nkauj'lis Lyfoung formed '''Pom Siab Hmoob Theatre''' (PSHT). It was the first Hmong theater company in the world.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Fres Thao|title=Center for Hmong Arts &amp; Talent (CHAT)|url=http://www.mnopedia.org/place/center-hmong-arts-talent-chat|publisher=[[MNopedia]]|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1997, PSHT wrote and produced eight successful plays in St. Paul. Of these, five were community-based and three were professionally staged.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 1998, PSHT members decided to expand the group's focus beyond theater arts in order to serve more Hmong artists. They changed its name to the Center for Hmong Arts &amp; Talent (CHAT). Their new work crossed multiple art genres, making CHAT the first and only multidisciplinary Hmong arts organization in the U.S. The CHAT acronym was inspired by the popularity of the internet [[chat room]]s of the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, CHAT debuted and refined several of its central initiatives. In the summer of 2001, it organized the first-ever Hmong Arts &amp; Music Festival at St. Paul's Western Sculpture Park. In the fall, CHAT's youth program extended its reach by taking arts instruction into St. Paul's federal housing projects. The program was called Art Saves Us—in part because several core CHAT artists were raised in the projects, and art literally saved their lives.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2002, CHAT's Voice Your Mind [[open mic]] event, eventually rebranded Innovative Community Elevation (ICE) Open Mic, was created. The program took place at venues such as Hmong ABC, Jasmine Teashop, and [[Metro State University]]. It aimed to provide a supportive environment for artistic development and live performance.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

CHAT's involvement in technology and multimedia led to production efforts in music and film. It produced multiple videos and music compilations in the mid-2000s, including ''Hmongtopia: All About ABC's'' (2006) and ''The H Project'' (2005), a recording that raised awareness of the Hmong genocide in Laos.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2006, as a result of Hmong artists' increasing interest in the fashion industry, CHAT created the Fresh Traditions Fashion Show and program. This one-of-a-kind fashion event offered its all-Hmong roster of designers complete creative control. It also, however, presented them with a challenge: creating an outfit that incorporated fabrics and colors used in traditional Hmong clothing.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

Other CHAT programs and events launched during this period included CHAT Radio, which aired on [[KFAI]] between 2006 and 2010. The show provided information on the latest community arts news and showcased Hmong artists. Dawning&lt;&gt;''Dab Neeg'' Theatre (DDNT) was a theatre program that ran from 2007 until 2009. In 2007 alone, DDNT produced the collectively created ''Hmong-land''; staged [[May Lee Yang]]'s ''Sia(b)''; and toured ''Stir-Fried Pop Culture'' to schools and colleges.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In the fall of 2008 an influx of youth using the CHAT space as a creative hub prompted the creation of a new youth initiative. The Youth Leadership Group (YLG) targeted ages 15–19. The intense, year-long program used art as a vehicle to foster leadership skills and heighten students' expectations for success after high school. Youth met weekly to discuss critical issues affecting the Hmong community, plan arts campaigns, and present them to the public.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2014, the Hmong Arts &amp; Music Festival began taking place during the July 4 weekend within Lao Family Community of Minnesota's Hmong Freedom Celebration and Sports Festival. In that year, the event drew over fifteen thousand attendees.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2015, many of CHAT's programs continue to enrich the St. Paul arts scene, as well as the Hmong and immigrant/refugee communities. The Youth Leadership Group has produced five original theater pieces since its creation. As of 2015, it organizes CHAT's quarterly Friday Night Lights open mic. Art Saves Us continues to provide free transportation and arts instruction to nearly two hundred youth annually. And Fresh Traditions is still the only U.S. fashion show to feature Hmong designers exclusively.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

Used by [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and other [[Mesopotamian]] cultures beginning in the third millennium BC, '''clay nails''', also referred to as dedication or '''foundation pegs''', cones, or nails, were cone-shaped nails made of [[clay]], inscribed with [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], baked, and stuck into the mud-brick walls to serve as evidence that the [[temple]] or building was the divine property of the [[god]] to whom it was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=They Wrote on Clay |author=Edward Chiera |authorlink=Edward Chiera |editor=George G. Cameron |page=93 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1938 |isbn=978-0-226-10425-6 |series=Babylonian Tablets Speak Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Versions were also made of metal, including [[casting]]s with figurative designs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oscar White Muscarella|Muscarella, Oscar White]], ''Bronze and Iron: Ancient Near Eastern Artifacts in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'', pp. 303-312, 1988, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870995251}}, 9780870995255, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5sxqNhfmcQUC&amp;pg=PA303 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Hurrian foundation pegs]] (Syria, c. 2300 – c. 2159 BCE).

Additionally, uninscribed clay cones painted in different colors were used by Sumerians to create decorative [[mosaic]] patterns on walls and pillars of buildings, which also offered some protection against weathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cone mosaic excavated at the "Columned Hall," Uruk, Mesopotamia |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/L.1995.48.2 |publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar [[funerary cone]]s of [[ancient Egypt]] used the cone base as the major writing surface.

As some of the oldest 'documents' in history, the sponsor, responsible for the construction, or dedication of a work, some of the oldest histories, and/or intrigues are recorded. (Boasting sometimes led to historical inaccuracies, or misstatements of facts.)

===King Entemena===
King [[Entemena]]'s nail is a prime example of a clay nail in excellent condition, as well as a detailed story. He was king of [[Lagash]] towards the late-middle of the 3rd millennium BC.

===King Hammurabi===
One of King [[Hammurabi]]'s clay nails was acquired in March 1938 from an antique dealer. The nail, although fully preserved, is missing almost the entire shaft. The head has a diameter of 187 millimeters. In comparison, the shaft at the base is 110 millimeters in diameter. Both the head and shaft are inscribed with cuneiform writing in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. There are three columns of text on the head of the nail; the first column on the upper half having dulled over the course of centuries, and the lower half of the third column broken off. The clay nail bears the number A 24645 at the Oriental Institute, the [[University of Chicago]]'s archaeology museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelb|first1=I. J.|title=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|journal=Chicago Journals|date=1948|volume=7|issue=4|pages=267–271|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/542219?sid=21105499609531&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=70 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two replicas of the clay nail with the same inscription located at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] and the [[Oxford Museum]]. However, each were transliterated and translated differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clay|first1=A. T.|title=The American Journal of Theology|journal=Chicago Journals|date=1916|volume=20|issue=3|pages=427–430|jstor=3155663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia version is filled with missing text, although the complication was solved with the help of the Chicago version. Simultaneously, the Oxford text gives the Sumerian version. All three clay nails are now preserved in each of their respected locations. They are easily recognized to be from the Hammurabi period due to their distinct style of having a mushroom shape, broad heads, and short shafts.

'''''Daybreak''''' is a painting by American artist [[Maxfield Parrish]] made in 1922. ''Daybreak'' is regarded as the most popular art print of the 20th century, based on number of [[Printmaking|prints]] made: one for every four American homes. According to the [[National Museum of American Illustration]], it has outsold [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' and [[Da Vinci]]'s ''[[Last Supper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanillustration.org/html/press/press_7_5_06.html |title=Press Release |publisher=The National Museum of American Illustration |date=July 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211183835/http://www.americanillustration.org/html/press/press_7_5_06.html |archivedate=2007-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in print.

Parrish referred to ''Daybreak'' as his "great painting", the epitome of his work. 

== Composition ==
Measuring {{convert|26.5|x|45|in|cm|sigfig=3}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Alma |title=Maxfield Parrish: The Masterworks |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |date=1992 |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; the painting employs a formal layout similar to a stage set, with two feminine figures. Painted using preparatory photographs, the models were his regular models, Kitty Owen (granddaughter of [[William Jennings Bryan]]), Parrish's daughter Jean, and Susan Lewin. Only two figures appear in the completed painting, though pencil studies indicate that the artist originally intended a third near the righthand column.&lt;ref name="Ludwig" /&gt; The composition is arranged on the principle of "[[The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry|dynamic symmetry]]" popularized by [[Jay Hambidge]].&lt;ref name="Ludwig"&gt;{{cite book |first=Coy |last=Ludwig |title=Maxfield Parrish |publisher=Watson-Guptil |date=1973 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Record purchase price ==
The painting has always been in private ownership. On May 25, 2006, ''Daybreak'' was purchased by a private collector ([[Mel Gibson]]'s then-wife, Robyn) at auction at [[Christie's]] for [[United States dollar|US $]]7.6 million. This set a record price for a Parrish painting. It was sold again on May 21, 2010 for US $5.2 million.

==In popular culture==
* In 1995 [[Michael Jackson]] produced a music video, "[[You Are Not Alone]]", featuring himself and his then wife, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in which they appear semi-nude in emulation of Daybreak.
* The [[Bloom County]] comic book ''[[Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things]]'' features a cover with many elements of ''Daybreak'' and other works by Parrish.
* The [[Dalis Car]] album cover "The Waking Hour" uses a detail from ''Daybreak''.
* [[The Moody Blues]] 1983 album ''[[The Present]]'' features cover artwork that uses a variation of ''Daybreak''.
* A 1986 Nestle television commercial for Alpine White features one scene imitating ''Daybreak'' and another resembling Parrish's ''Ecstasy''.
* The [[Saint Preux]] album "The Last Opera" also uses "Daybreak" for its cover.
* "Daybreak in O'Bryonville" (2009) is a Cincinnati mural designed for [[ArtWorks]] by contemporary artist [[Kate Holterhoff]]. Parrish's flowering vine motif figures prominently in Holterhoff's mural.

'''''Destination Mecca''''' is an early book by the writer [[Idries Shah]], who went on to produce an extensive corpus of material on [[Sufism]] that is both accessible and relevant to contemporary western readers. It was first published by Rider in 1957 (with photographs by the author), and subsequently by Octagon Press in 1969 (minus the photos).&lt;ref&gt;Destination Mecca page on Octagonpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; Shah had already made a name for himself as the author of two well-researched and in many ways ground-breaking books about magic. However, these scholarly works, and the vastly more influential work, ''[[The Sufis]]'', which was to follow in 1964, by their nature entailed keeping his own personality in the background. His intention in this present book appears to be to counterbalance this tendency through his skilful use of the familiar travel book format, and he steps out of the shadows as an approachable young man with a lively mind and a fine sense of humour and adventure – someone who is comfortable in his mid-twentieth century skin and equally at home in Eastern and Western contexts.

''Destination Mecca'' contains descriptions and photographs of some of Shah's travels in North Africa and the Near and Middle East, including time spent in [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Jordan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], where he describes pilgrimages to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] and being a guest of the [[Saudi Royal Family]] a few years before the death of [[Ibn Saud]] in 1953. Among the book's twenty-three pieces of reportage is also the description of a visit to a [[Bektashi]] Sufi community in [[Syria]] composed mainly of dervishes who had migrated there from [[Turkey]] when [[Kemal Ataturk]] had outlawed the practice of Sufism. Shah says that he had "been present often enough at the gatherings of Sufis in various places, taken part in their recitations and listened to their discourses" but that he wanted to get a clearer view of Sufi life and activities in the monasteries. He had a letter of introduction to the Sheikh of the community, and was invited to attend and participate in their activities and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Idries (1971). ''Destination Mecca''. London: The Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0900860138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' review commented that "Sayed Idries Shah has done much to explain the world of Islam to Westerners and in particular, to promote the study of Sufi philosophy among English-speaking people... Much of what he writes illuminates factors of permanent importance in the Middle East; and no one can read this book without carrying away a lasting impression of the vigour and vitality of Islamic culture, and of the many surprising manifestations of that culture in the Asian world of today."&lt;ref&gt;The Times Literary Supplement, 5 December 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italian language}}

The '''''Divine Comedy''''' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|diˈviːna komˈmɛːdja|}}) is an Italian long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered to be the preeminent work in [[Italian literature]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Encyclopedia Americana'', 2006, Vol. 30. p.&amp;nbsp;605: "the greatest single work of Italian literature;" John Julius Norwich, ''The Italians: History, Art, and the Genius of a People'', Abrams, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;27: "his tremendous poem, still after six and a half centuries the supreme work of Italian literature, remains&amp;nbsp;– after the legacy of ancient Rome&amp;nbsp;– the grandest single element in the Italian heritage;" and Robert Reinhold Ergang, ''The Renaissance'', Van Nostrand, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;103: "Many literary historians regard the Divine Comedy as the greatest work of Italian literature. In world literature it is ranked as an epic poem of the highest order."&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greatest works of [[world literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Bloom | first=Harold | authorlink=Harold Bloom | title=The Western Canon | year=1994}} See also [[Western canon]] for other "canons" that include the ''Divine Comedy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's imaginative vision of the [[afterlife]] is representative of the [[medieval philosophy|medieval world-view]] as it had developed in the [[Catholic Church|Western Church]] by the 14th century. It helped establish the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]], in which it is written (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the standardized [[Italian language]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book| last=Lepschy | first=Laura |author2=Lepschy, Giulio | title=The Italian Language Today | year=1977}} or any other history of [[Italian language]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into three parts: ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', ''[[Purgatorio]]'', and ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.

The narrative describes Dante's travels through [[Christian views on hell|Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and Paradise or [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. Bondanella, ''The Inferno'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;xliii, Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, 2003, {{ISBN|1-59308-051-4}}: "the key fiction of the ''Divine Comedy'' is that the poem is true."&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorically]] the poem represents the soul's journey towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]] and the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Allen Dinsmore, ''The Teachings of Dante'', Ayer Publishing, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;38, {{ISBN|0-8369-5521-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ''Divine Comedy'' has been called "the ''Summa'' in verse".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;dq=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;cd=10 ''The Fordham Monthly''] Fordham University, Vol. XL, Dec. 1921, p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dante's work, Virgil is presented as [[human reason]] and Beatrice is presented as [[omniscience|divine knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Approaches to teaching Dante's Divine comedy|date=1982|publisher=Modern Language Association of America|others=Slade, Carole., Cecchetti, Giovanni, 1922–1998.|isbn=978-0873524780|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=7671339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was originally simply titled '''''Comedia''''' ({{IPA-it|komeˈdiːa|pron}}; so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472), Tuscan for "[[Comedy]]", later adjusted to the modern Italian {{lang|it|Commedia}}. The adjective {{lang|it|Divina}} was added by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], and the first edition to name the poem ''Divina Comedia'' in the title was that of the Venetian [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] [[Lodovico Dolce]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Terpening|Ronnie H. Terpening]], ''Lodovico Dolce, Renaissance Man of Letters'' (Toronto, Buffalo, London: University of Toronto Press, 1997), p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1555 by [[Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari]].

==Structure and story==
The ''Divine Comedy'' is composed of 14,233 lines that are divided into three ''cantiche'' (singular ''cantica'')&amp;nbsp;– ''Inferno'' ([[Hell]]), ''Purgatorio'' ([[Purgatory]]), and ''Paradiso'' ([[Heaven|Paradise]])&amp;nbsp;– each consisting of 33 [[canto]]s (Italian plural  ''canti'')&lt;!--NOTE: BEFORE ADDING "Inferno has 34" (AGAIN) READ THE NEXT SENTENCE--&gt;. An initial [[canto]], serving as an introduction to the poem and generally considered to be part of the first ''cantica'', brings the total number of cantos to 100. It is generally accepted, however, that the first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the entire epic, and that the opening two cantos of each ''cantica'' serve as prologues to each of the three ''cantiche''.&lt;ref&gt;Dante The Inferno A Verse Translation by Professor Robert and Jean Hollander p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epist. XIII 43 to 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins E.H The Prologue to the Divine Comedy Annual Report of the Dante Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number "three" is prominent in the work, represented in part by the number of ''cantiche'' and their lengths. Additionally, the verse scheme used, ''[[terza rima]]'', is [[hendecasyllabic]] (lines of eleven syllables), with the lines composing [[tercet]]s according to the [[rhyme scheme]] ''aba, bcb, cdc, ded, ...''.

Written in the first person, the poem tells of Dante's journey through the three realms of the dead, lasting from [[Maundy Thursday|the night before]] [[Good Friday]] to the Wednesday after [[Easter]] in the spring of 1300. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] guides him through Hell and Purgatory; [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], Dante's ideal woman, guides him through Heaven. Beatrice was a Florentine woman whom he had met in childhood and admired from afar in the mode of the then-fashionable [[courtly love]] tradition, which is highlighted in Dante's earlier work ''[[La Vita Nuova]]''.{{sfn|Shaw|2014|pp=xx, 100–101, 108}}

The structure of the three realms follows a common [[Numerology|numerical pattern]] of 9 plus 1, for a total of 10: 9 circles of the Inferno, followed by Lucifer contained at its bottom; 9 rings of Mount Purgatory, followed by the [[Garden of Eden]] crowning its summit; and the 9 celestial bodies of Paradiso, followed by the [[Empyrean]] containing the very essence of God. Within each group of 9, 7 elements correspond to a specific moral scheme, subdivided into three subcategories, while 2 others of greater particularity are added to total nine. For example, the [[seven deadly sins]] of the Catholic Church that are cleansed in Purgatory are joined by special realms for the Late repentant and the [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the church. The core seven sins within Purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, subdivided into three groups corresponding to excessive love ([[Lust]], [[Gluttony]], [[Greed]]), deficient love ([[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]), and malicious love ([[Wrath]], [[Envy]], [[Pride]]).{{sfn|Eiss|2017|p=8}}

In central Italy's political struggle between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], Dante was part of the Guelphs, who in general favored the [[Papacy]] over the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Florence's Guelphs split into factions around 1300—the White Guelphs and the Black Guelphs. Dante was among the White Guelphs who were exiled in 1302 by the Lord-Mayor Cante de' [[Gabrielli]] di [[Gubbio]], after troops under [[Charles of Valois]] entered the city, at the request of [[Pope Boniface&amp;nbsp;VIII]], who supported the Black Guelphs. This exile, which lasted the rest of Dante's life, shows its influence in many parts of the ''Comedy,'' from prophecies of Dante's exile to Dante's views of politics, to the eternal damnation of some of his opponents.{{sfn|Trone|2000|pp=362–364}}

The last word in each of the three ''cantiche'' is ''stelle'' ("stars").

===''Inferno''===

{{Main|Inferno (Dante)}}
The poem begins on the [[Maundy Thursday|night before Good Friday]] in the year 1300, "halfway along our life's path" (''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita''). Dante is thirty-five years old, half of the biblical lifespan of 70 ([[Psalms]] 89:10&lt;!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 --&gt;, Vulgate), lost in a dark [[forest|wood]] (understood as sin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.it/INFERNO-DIVINA-COMMEDIA-ANNOTATA-COMMENTATA-TOMMASO/590245816/bd |title=Inferno, la Divina Commedia annotata e commentata da Tommaso Di Salvo, Zanichelli, Bologna, 1985 |publisher=Abebooks.it |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lectura Dantis'', Società dantesca italiana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Online sources include [http://www.ladante.it/DanteAlighieri/hochfeiler/inferno/naviga/selva.htm], [http://www.operare.net/news.php?id=55] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233122/http://www.operare.net/news.php?id=55 |date=23 July 2011 }}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061113164331/http://www.learnitaly.com/selva.htm] [http://balbruno.altervista.org/index-182.html], {{cite web|url=http://www.primocircolopotenza.it/DivinaCommedia/Dante/caratteristiche.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202062524/http://www.primocircolopotenza.it/DivinaCommedia/Dante/caratteristiche.htm|archivedate=2 December 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=1 December 2009}}, [http://www.skuola.net/dante/divina-commedia/dante-l-inferno-simbolismo-e-allegorismo-il-simbolismo-numerico.html], and [http://doc.studenti.it/appunti/dante/3/inferno.html]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052503/http://www.ladante.it/DanteAlighieri/hochfeiler/inferno/naviga/selva.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assailed by beasts (a [[lion]], a [[leopard]], and a [[wolf|she-wolf]]) he cannot evade and unable to find the "straight way" (''diritta via'')&amp;nbsp;– also translatable as "right way"&amp;nbsp;– to salvation (symbolized by the sun behind the mountain). Conscious that he is ruining himself and that he is falling into a "low place" (''basso loco'') where the sun is silent ('''l sol tace''), Dante is at last rescued by Virgil, and the two of them begin their journey to the underworld. Each sin's punishment in ''Inferno'' is a ''[[contrapasso]]'', a symbolic instance of [[poetic justice]]; for example, in Canto XX, [[Fortune-telling|fortune-tellers]] and [[Divination|soothsayers]] must walk with their heads on backwards, unable to see what is ahead, because that was what they had tried to do in life:

{{poemquote|they had their faces twisted toward their haunches
and found it necessary to walk backward,
because they could not see ahead of them.
... and since he wanted so to see ahead,
he looks behind and walks a backward path.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XX, lines 13–15 and 38–39, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Allegorically, the ''Inferno'' represents the Christian soul seeing sin for what it really is, and the three beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence ([[lust]], [[gluttony]], [[avarice]], [[anger]]); Circle 7 for the sins of violence; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, with the addition of Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed, ''Divine Comedy'', "Notes to Dante's Inferno"&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Purgatorio''===
{{Main|Purgatorio}}
[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|Dante gazes at Mount Purgatory in an allegorical portrait by [[Agnolo Bronzino]], painted c. 1530]]
Having survived the depths of Hell, Dante and Virgil ascend out of the undergloom to the Mountain of [[Purgatory]] on the far side of the world. The Mountain is on an island, the only land in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], created by the displacement of rock which resulted when Satan's fall created Hell&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto 34, lines 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt; (which Dante portrays as existing underneath [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, ''The Dante Encyclopedia'', p.&amp;nbsp;475, Garland Publishing, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8153-1659-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The mountain has seven terraces, corresponding to the [[seven deadly sins]] or "seven roots of sinfulness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–67 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of sin here is more psychological than that of the ''Inferno'', being based on motives, rather than actions. It is also drawn primarily from Christian theology, rather than from classical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;xiv (Penguin, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dante's illustrative examples of sin and virtue draw on classical sources as well as on the Bible and on contemporary events.

Love, a theme throughout the ''Divine Comedy'', is particularly important for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends ([[Wrath]], [[Envy]], [[Pride]]), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough ([[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]) or love that is too strong ([[Lust]], [[Gluttony]], [[Greed]]). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from the church and the Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle-Oakey-Wickstead, ''Divine Comedy'', "Notes on Dante's Purgatory.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- 7 + 2 = 9 not 10 --&gt;

Allegorically, the ''Purgatorio'' represents the Christian life. Christian souls arrive escorted by an angel, singing ''[[Psalm 114|In exitu Israel de Aegypto]]''. In his ''Letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande]]'', Dante explains that this reference to Israel leaving Egypt refers both to the [[redemption (religious)|redemption]] of [[Christ]] and to "the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to the state of grace."&lt;ref&gt;"The Letter to Can Grande," in ''Literary Criticism of Dante Alighieri'', translated and edited by Robert S. Haller (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1973), 99&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriately, therefore, it is [[Easter Sunday]] when Dante and Virgil arrive.

The ''Purgatorio'' is notable for demonstrating the medieval knowledge of a [[spherical Earth]]. During the poem, Dante discusses the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the sun, and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth. At this stage it is, Dante says, sunset at Jerusalem, midnight on the River [[Ganges]], and sunrise in Purgatory.

===''Paradiso''===
{{Main|Paradiso (Dante)}}
[[File:Philipp Veit 004.jpg|thumb|''Paradiso'', Canto III: Dante and Beatrice speak to [[Piccarda]] and [[Constance of Sicily]], in a fresco by [[Philipp Veit]].]]

After an initial ascension, Beatrice guides Dante through the nine [[celestial spheres]] of [[Heaven]]. These are concentric and spherical, as in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] cosmology. While the structures of the ''Inferno'' and ''Purgatorio'' were based on different classifications of sin, the structure of the ''Paradiso'' is based on the [[four cardinal virtues]] and the [[three theological virtues]].

The first seven spheres of Heaven deal solely with the cardinal virtues of [[Prudence]], [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]], [[Justice]] and [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. The first three describe a deficiency of one of the cardinal virtues&amp;nbsp;– the [[Moon]], containing the inconstant, whose vows to God waned as the moon and thus lack fortitude; [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], containing the ambitious, who were virtuous for glory and thus lacked justice; and Venus, containing the lovers, whose love was directed towards another than God and thus lacked Temperance. The final four incidentally are positive examples of the cardinal virtues, all led on by the [[Sun]], containing the prudent, whose wisdom lighted the way for the other virtues, to which the others are bound (constituting a category on its own). [[Mars]] contains the men of fortitude who died in the cause of Christianity; [[Jupiter]] contains the kings of Justice; and [[Saturn]] contains the temperate, the monks who abided by the contemplative lifestyle. The seven subdivided into three are raised further by two more categories: the eighth sphere of the fixed stars that contain those who achieved the theological virtues of [[faith]], [[hope]] and [[love]], and represent the [[Church Triumphant]]&amp;nbsp;– the total perfection of humanity, cleansed of all the sins and carrying all the virtues of heaven; and the ninth circle, or [[Primum Mobile]] (corresponding to the Geocentricism of Medieval astronomy), which contains the angels, creatures never poisoned by original sin. Topping them all is the [[Empyrean]], which contains the essence of God, completing the 9-fold division to 10.

Dante meets and converses with several great saints of the Church, including [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Saint Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|St. John]]. The ''Paradiso'' is consequently more theological in nature than the ''Inferno'' and the ''Purgatorio''. However, Dante admits that the vision of heaven he receives is merely the one his human eyes permit him to see, and thus the vision of heaven found in the Cantos is Dante's personal vision.

The ''Divine Comedy'' finishes with Dante seeing the [[Trinity|Triune God]]. In a flash of understanding that he cannot express, Dante finally understands the mystery of [[Christ]]'s divinity and humanity, and his soul becomes aligned with God's love:&lt;ref name="DLS33"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto&amp;nbsp;XXXIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|But already my desire and my will
were being turned like a wheel, all at one speed,
by the Love which moves the sun and the other stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XXXIII, lines 142–145, [[C. H. Sisson]] translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Thematic concerns==
The ''Divine Comedy'' can be described simply as an [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegory]]: each canto, and the episodes therein, can contain many alternative meanings. Dante's allegory, however, is more complex, and, in explaining how to read the poem&amp;nbsp;– see the ''Letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/cangrande.english.html |title=Epistle to Can Grande |work=faculty.georgetown.edu |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – he outlines other levels of meaning besides the allegory: the historical, the moral, the literal, and the [[anagoge|anagogical]].

The structure of the poem is also quite complex, with mathematical and numerological patterns distributed throughout the work, particularly threes and nines, which are related to the [[Holy Trinity]]. The poem is often lauded for its particularly human qualities: Dante's skillful delineation of the characters he encounters in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise; his bitter denunciations of [[Florence|Florentine]] and Italian politics; and his powerful poetic imagination. Dante's use of real characters, according to [[Dorothy Sayers]] in her introduction to her translation of the ''Inferno'', allows Dante the freedom of not having to involve the reader in description, and allows him to "[make] room in his poem for the discussion of a great many subjects of the utmost importance, thus widening its range and increasing its variety."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;16 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante called the poem "Comedy" (the adjective "Divine" was added later, in the 16th century) because poems in the ancient world were classified as High ("Tragedy") or Low ("Comedy").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Tragedy/|title = Ancient History Encyclopedia|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low poems had happy endings and were written in everyday language, whereas High poems treated more serious matters and were written in an elevated style. Dante was one of the first in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of humanity, in the low and "vulgar" Italian language and not the Latin one might expect for such a serious topic. [[Boccaccio]]'s account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in [[Latin]] is still controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Boccaccio also quotes the initial triplet:"Ultima regna canam fluvido contermina mundo, / spiritibus quae lata patent, quae premia solvunt /pro meritis cuicumque suis".

===Scientific themes===
Although the ''Divine Comedy'' is primarily a religious poem, discussing sin, virtue, and theology, Dante also discusses several elements of the [[Science in the Middle Ages|science of his day]] (this mixture of science with poetry has received both praise and blame over the centuries&lt;ref&gt;Michael Caesar, ''Dante: The Critical Heritage'', Routledge, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;288, 383, 412, 631.&lt;/ref&gt;). The ''Purgatorio'' repeatedly refers to the implications of a [[spherical Earth]], such as the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the [[sun]], and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth. For example, at sunset in Purgatory it is midnight at the [[Ebro]], dawn in Jerusalem, and noon on the River Ganges:&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on p.&amp;nbsp;286&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|Just as, there where its Maker shed His blood,
the sun shed its first rays, and Ebro lay
beneath high Libra, and the ninth hour's rays

were scorching Ganges' waves; so here, the sun
stood at the point of day's departure when
God's angel—happy—showed himself to us.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto&amp;nbsp;XXVII, lines 1–6, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dante travels through the centre of the Earth in the ''Inferno'', and comments on the resulting change in the direction of [[gravity]] in Canto&amp;nbsp;XXXIV (lines 76–120). A little earlier (XXXIII, 102–105), he queries the existence of wind in the frozen inner circle of hell, since it has no temperature differentials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Inferno'', notes on p.&amp;nbsp;284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inevitably, given its setting, the ''Paradiso'' discusses [[astronomy]] extensively, but in the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic]] sense. The ''Paradiso'' also discusses the importance of the [[experiment|experimental method]] in science, with a detailed example in lines 94–105 of Canto&amp;nbsp;II:

{{poemquote|Yet an experiment, were you to try it,
could free you from your cavil and the source
of your arts' course springs from experiment.

Taking three mirrors, place a pair of them
at equal distance from you; set the third
midway between those two, but farther back.

Then, turning toward them, at your back have placed
a light that kindles those three mirrors and
returns to you, reflected by them all.

Although the image in the farthest glass
will be of lesser size, there you will see
that it must match the brightness of the rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto&amp;nbsp;II, lines 94–105, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A briefer example occurs in Canto XV of the ''Purgatorio'' (lines 16–21), where Dante points out that both theory and experiment confirm that the [[reflection (physics)|angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection]]. Other references to science in the ''Paradiso'' include descriptions of [[clock]]work in Canto&amp;nbsp;XXIV (lines 13–18), and [[Thales' theorem]] about triangles in Canto&amp;nbsp;XIII (lines 101–102).

[[Galileo Galilei]] is known to have lectured on the ''Inferno'', and it has been suggested that the poem may have influenced some of Galileo's own ideas regarding mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Mark A. [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/mpeterso/galileo/scaling8.pdf "Galileo's discovery of scaling laws"]. ''American Journal of Physics'' '''70''', 575 (2002). {{doi|10.1119/1.1475329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of influence from Islamic philosophy==
In 1919, [[Miguel Asín Palacios]], a Spanish scholar and a Catholic priest, published ''La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (''Islamic [[Eschatology]] in the Divine Comedy''), an account of parallels between [[early Islamic philosophy]] and the ''Divine Comedy''. Palacios argued that Dante derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter from the spiritual writings of [[Ibn Arabi]] and from the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] or night journey of [[Muhammad]] to heaven. The latter is described in the ''[[ahadith]]'' and the ''[[Kitab al Miraj]]'' (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before&lt;ref name="Heullant"&gt;I. Heullant-Donat and M.-A. Polo de Beaulieu, "Histoire d'une traduction," in ''Le Livre de l'échelle de Mahomet'', Latin edition and French translation by Gisèle Besson and Michèle Brossard-Dandré, Collection ''Lettres Gothiques'', Le Livre de Poche, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;22 with note 37.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Liber Scalae Machometi'', "The Book of Muhammad's Ladder"), and has significant similarities to the ''Paradiso'', such as a [[Seven Heavens|sevenfold division of Paradise]], although this is not unique to the ''Kitab al Miraj'' or Islamic cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ascent to Heaven in Islamic and Jewish Mysticism|last1=Uždavinys|first1=Algis|page=23, 92–93, 117|isbn=978-1908092021|publisher=Matheson Trust |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "superficial similarities"&lt;ref&gt;William Montgomery Watt and Pierre Cachia, ''A History of Islamic Spain'', 2nd edition, Edinburgh University Press, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126, {{ISBN|0-7486-0847-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Divine Comedy'' to the ''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran]]'' or ''Epistle of Forgiveness'' of [[Al-Ma'arri]] have also been mentioned in this debate. The ''Resalat Al-Ghufran'' describes the journey of the poet in the realms of the afterlife and includes dialogue with people in Heaven and Hell, although, unlike the ''Kitab al Miraj'', there is little description of these locations,&lt;ref&gt;Dionisius A. Agius and Richard Hitchcock, ''The Arab Influence in Medieval Europe'', Ithaca Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;70, {{ISBN|0-86372-213-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is unlikely that Dante borrowed from this work.&lt;ref&gt;Kāmil Kīlānī and G. Brackenbury, Introduction to ''Risalat ul Ghufran: A Divine Comedy'', 3rd ed, Al-Maaref Printing and Publishing House, 1943, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theory "receives little credence", according to Watt and Cachia, p.&amp;nbsp;183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante did, however, live in a Europe of substantial literary and philosophical contact with the Muslim world, encouraged by such factors as [[Averroism]] ("Averrois, che'l gran comento feo" Commedia, Inferno, IV, 144, meaning "Averrois, who wrote the great comment") and the patronage of [[Alfonso&amp;nbsp;X of Castile]]. Of the twelve wise men Dante meets in Canto&amp;nbsp;X of the ''Paradiso'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] and, even more so, [[Siger of Brabant]] were strongly influenced by Arabic commentators on [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="copleston"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Philosophy, Volume 2|author=Frederick Copleston|location=London|year=1950|publisher=Continuum|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval [[Christian mysticism]] also shared the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] influence of [[Sufi cosmology|Sufis]] such as [[Ibn Arabi]]. Philosopher [[Frederick Copleston]] argued in 1950 that Dante's respectful treatment of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], and Siger of Brabant indicates his acknowledgement of a "considerable debt" to Islamic philosophy.&lt;ref name="copleston" /&gt;

Although this philosophical influence is generally acknowledged, many scholars have not been satisfied that Dante was influenced by the ''Kitab al Miraj''. The 20th century Orientalist [[:it:Francesco Gabrieli|Francesco Gabrieli]] expressed skepticism regarding the claimed similarities, and the lack of evidence of a vehicle through which it could have been transmitted to Dante. Even so, while dismissing the probability of some influences posited in Palacios' work,&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Gabrieli, "New light on Dante and Islam", ''Diogenes'', 2:61–73, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrieli conceded that it was "at least possible, if not probable, that Dante may have known the ''Liber Scalae'' and have taken from it certain images and concepts of Muslim eschatology". Shortly before her death, the Italian philologist [[:it:Maria Corti|Maria Corti]] pointed out that, during his stay at the court of Alfonso&amp;nbsp;X, Dante's mentor [[Brunetto Latini]] met Bonaventura de Siena, a Tuscan who had translated the ''Kitab al Miraj'' from Arabic into Latin. Corti speculates that Brunetto may have provided a copy of that work to Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emsf.rai.it/interviste/interviste.asp?d=490#3|title=Errore|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Guénon]], a Sufi convert and scholar of Ibn Arabi, rejected in ''The Esoterism of Dante''  the theory of his influence (direct or indirect) on Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Guenon| first=René| authorlink=René Guenon | title=The Esoterism of Dante | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palacios' theory that Dante was influenced by Ibn Arabi was satirized by the Turkish academic [[Orhan Pamuk]] in his novel [[The Black Book (Pamuk novel)|''The Black Book'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=515–537|year=2002|last1=Almond|first1=Ian|title= The Honesty of the Perplexed: Derrida and Ibn 'Arabi on "Bewilderment" |jstor=1466522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence in the English-speaking world and beyond==

The ''Divine Comedy'' was not always as well-regarded as it is today. Although recognized as a [[masterpiece]] in the centuries immediately following its publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaucer]] wrote in the [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/chaucer/canterbury/daniel/chapter13.html Monk's Tale], "Redeth the grete poete of Ytaille /
That highte Dant, for he kan al devyse /
Fro point to point; nat o word wol he faille".&lt;/ref&gt; the work was largely ignored during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with some notable exceptions such as [[Vittorio Alfieri]]; [[Antoine de Rivarol]], who translated the ''Inferno'' into French; and [[Giambattista Vico]], who in the ''Scienza nuova'' and in the ''Giudizio su Dante'' inaugurated what would later become the romantic reappraisal of Dante, juxtaposing him to Homer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Auerbach]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=R_HofoKY87gC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=Vico++Dante&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=OzD6SISdOIm6zAS449X9DA Dante: Poet of the Secular World]. {{ISBN|0-226-03205-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Comedy'' was "rediscovered" in the English-speaking world by [[William Blake]]&amp;nbsp;– who illustrated several passages of the epic&amp;nbsp;– and the [[romanticism|romantic]] writers of the 19th century. Later authors such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[James Joyce]] have drawn on it for inspiration. The poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] was its first American translator,&lt;ref&gt;Irmscher, Christoph. ''Longfellow Redux''.

The '''Edinburgh Annuale''' is a visual art festival involving [[Edinburgh]] [[art gallery|galleries]] and art projects, especially ones that promote local activity in the [[visual arts]]. The Edinburgh Annuale exists to promote grassroots visual arts operations in the city.

The Annuale is co-ordinated by Edinburgh Artist Run Initiative [http://www.embassygallery.org The Embassy] with a programme including publication launches, [[Live Art (art form)|live events]] and [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]]. The first Edinburgh Annuale took place in August 2004 and included exhibitions at The Embassy, Wuthering Heights, Magnifitat, The Forest Cafe and Aurora Projects. The festival has grown to include many more events and exhibitions and has some financial support from the [[Scottish Arts Council]] amongst others.

'''Expression''' (Lat. expressio) in [[architecture]] implies a clear and authentic displaying of the [[Character structure|character]] or personality of an individual ([[architect]]). The expression is often identified with the [[architectural]] movement of [[expressionism]], whose main starting point and aim is to present and express what has been „seen“ or [[experienced]] in the inner eye of the mind, heart and soul, i.e. to express the [[subjectivity|subjective]] moods and [[feelings]] without referring to conventional and „objective” values, judgments and truths. 

==Meaning==
The main problem in the [[critical analysis]] of the theoretical [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]]s of the [[concept]] of expression in architecture, lies in the fact that the concept of expression is used in different ways in different fields of [[science]] and art. Regarding the [[concept]] of expression, the following interpretations can often be found:
*an activity or way of transforming an idea into words; 
*showing [[emotions]], [[feelings]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J. (2007). Expression and expressiveness in art. ''[[Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics]]'', 4 (2), 19-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*conveying emotions by way of music, images etc.; 
*[[facial expression]] showing mood or emotion; 
*choice of words, [[phrases]], [[syntax]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] etc., in communication;&lt;ref&gt;Tošović, B. (2004). Ekspresivnost. Stil, 3, 25-61.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*a specific [[phrase]] commonly used to express something etc. 
In the widest sense, the [[concept]] of expression refers to the activity undertaken with a specific [[intention]]. However, what is the aim of expressing something will depend on the field in which the term is used.&lt;ref&gt;Alfirevic, Dj. (2011). Visual Expression in Architecture. Arhitektura i urbanizam, 31, 3-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this is mind, some authors emphasize the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] or spontaneous character of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, R. G. The Principles of Art. New York: Oxford University Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wenninger, R. (2005). Individual Style after the End of Art. Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics, 2 (3), 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt; while others emphasize its [[cognitive]] aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Dilworth, J. (2004). Artistic Expression and Interpretation. [[British Journal of Aesthetics]], 44 (1), 10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
Expression can also be defined as part of the [[communication]] process which consists of two complementary components, expression (transmitted information) and impression (received information).&lt;ref&gt;Argan Đ.K., Oliva Akile B. (1970). Modern Art 1770-1970-2000. Belgrade: CLIO, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Robinson, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eyehategod''' (also abbreviated and referred to as '''EHG''') is an American [[sludge metal]] band from [[New Orleans]] who formed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p38682|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Eyehategod|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have become one of the better known bands to emerge from the [[Music of New Orleans#Heavy metal|NOLA metal scene]]. Throughout the years, their core line-up has remained, with the exceptions of the bassist, a slot in which several musicians have played, and the death of drummer Joey LaCaze in 2013.

Eyehategod have noted [[Melvins]], [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]], [[The Obsessed]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Confessor (band)|Confessor]] and [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/sexthroughwar/blog/140890779 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312120017/https://www.myspace.com/sexthroughwar/blog/140890779 |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as key influences to their sound. Heavy, detuned, and [[blues]]y guitar riffs dominate the band's discography. They are combined with walls of feedback and tortured vocals to create a harsh [[misanthropic]] vibe. The band was friends with [[Anal Cunt]] and performed with them for the first show after their frontman [[Seth Putnam]] came out of his coma.

==History==

===Early years and ''In the Name of Suffering'' (1989-92)===
Very little is known about early Eyehategod. [[Jimmy Bower]] and Joey LaCaze founded the band on April 20, 1988 (in accordance with [[420 (cannabis culture)|4/20 in cannabis culture]]), and they recruited Brian Patton, Steve Dale and vocalist Chris Hilliard.&lt;ref name="spirit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=n/a|title=Eyehategod: Interview [Interview with Gary Mader]|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/interview-groupe-Eyehategod-id_inter-607-l-fr.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhiYUIJ9_KfWeq-7r6_CzC__T5o6jA|website=spirit-of-metal.com|publisher=Spirit of Metal|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilliard would later leave the group early on, and would be replaced by [[Mike Williams (singer)|Mike Williams]]. The band then recorded two demos ''Garden Dwarf Woman Driver'' (1989) and ''Lack of Almost Everything'' (1990); the latter was sent out to various labels. They eventually got signed to the small French label Intellectual Convulsion, and released their first album ''[[In the Name of Suffering]]'' in 1990. The album had a far more primitive and raw sound than later releases (as it was recorded by the inexperienced band members for only $1000),&lt;ref name="metalurges"&gt;{{cite web|last1=n/a|title=013 Eyehategod Biography|url=https://metalurgespodcast.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/013-eyehategod/|website=metalurgespodcast.wordpress.com|publisher=Metal Urges Podcast|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a more [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] feel to it. The label dissolved with only a couple of thousand copies having been printed, so the band had to find a new label. They soon signed with [[Century Media]] however, who re-released ''In the Name of Suffering'' on December 1, 1992, as it is known today. Also in 2006, ''In the Name of Suffering'' was re-issued with four bonus tracks. These four tracks were the same as those on the original demo ''Lack Of Almost Everything''.

===''Take as Needed for Pain'' (1993-94)===
Eyehategod then went on to record ''[[Take as Needed for Pain]]'' in 1993 with new bassist Mark Schultz who had also contributed on ''In The Name Of Suffering''. The album was recorded at [[Studio 13]], a small recording studio working from the 13th floor of an abandoned [[department store]] on Canal Street in New Orleans.&lt;ref name="metalurges"/&gt; The band played daily during this period to put down tracks for the album. At the time, Mike Williams was homeless (having been thrown out by his former girlfriend) and living in an abandoned, flea-infested room above a [[strip club]] just a few minutes away from the studio. The sound of ''Take as Needed for Pain'' seemed much closer to what the members intended than the material on ''In the Name of Suffering'', and it shows a cleaner, more distinct sound with better defined riffs. The [[southern rock]], [[blues music|blues]] and [[doom metal|doom]] influences are also more distinctly felt on this album. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively with acts such as [[Chaos UK]], [[Buzzov*en]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Corrosion of Conformity]]. After touring, the band members briefly spread out in different directions. Mike Williams busied himself contributing to ''[[Metal Maniacs]]'' magazine. Jimmy Bower played drums on [[Crowbar (U.S. band)|Crowbar]]'s ''[[Broken Glass (album)|Broken Glass]]'' as well as [[Down (band)|Down]]'s debut album, ''[[NOLA (album)|NOLA]]''. Brian Patton recorded [[Soilent Green]]'s debut album, ''[[Pussysoul]]''.

===''Dopesick'' (1995-97)===
The band had been recording several demos, which were released on various seven-inch records and [[split record|splits]] on various labels, but finally in 1995 settled down to record a full-length record, with [[Pepper Keenan]] of Corrosion of Conformity as producer, and new bassist Vince LeBlanc, which would be named ''[[Dopesick]]''. At the time, Mike Williams was living in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]] in New York City, and so had to travel between there and New Orleans frequently for the recording sessions. The recording sessions were infamously chaotic, and involved the studio owner reportedly calling Century to ask if the band were insane, and threatening to kick them out. This particular incident occurred after Mike Williams had attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process he slashed his hand open badly and bled all over the studio floor (this recording did make it to the record as the introduction to the first track, "My Name is God (I Hate You)"). One of the band members then apparently smeared the words "[[Hell]]" and "Death to Pigs" in Mike's blood. Brian Patton and Joey LaCaze then flew out to San Francisco to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] the album. This album was far more chaotic than their previous, but still retained the distinct southern, bluesy feel, distancing it from ''In the Name of Suffering''. The band then embarked on a US tour in the spring of 1997 to support the album, supporting [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Pantera]], bringing their music to a far wider audience, raising the profile of [[sludge metal]], and becoming (in)famous as one of its founding acts.

===''Confederacy of Ruined Lives'' (1998-2005)===
Eyehategod then went through a period of internal disputes, and went on unofficial hiatus as its members scattered again to record and tour with their various side-projects; namely Soilent Green, Corrosion of Conformity and Crowbar. Eventually, in 2000, the band reconvened (again with a new bassist, this time Daniel Nick) to compile their various ''Take as Needed for Pain'' and ''Dopesick'' era singles, seven inches and split records into one record, ''[[Southern Discomfort (Eyehategod album)|Southern Discomfort]]''. This reconvention gave them the impetus to knuckle down and record another album, and that album was 2000's ''[[Confederacy of Ruined Lives]]''. The album was a much more polished, sober affair, and so sounded distinctly more like a sequel to ''Take as Needed for Pain'' than ''Dopesick''. After its release, the band then toured extensively (embarking on a world tour for the first time, with dates in Europe and Japan), while its members still juggled their various side-projects. During this time, Down recorded their second album, and Bower formed the mostly instrumental band, [[Clearlight (band)|The Mystick Krewe of Clearlight]], as well as Soilent Green releasing their third album. Mike Williams also founded [[Outlaw Order]] and [[Arson Anthem]]. During all this activity, Eyehategod found time to compile and release their live album ''[[10 Years of Abuse (and Still Broke)]]'' (which was mainly released due to a contractual obligation with Century Media), and record and release yet more split records and 7&amp;nbsp;inches. With the release of their live album, the band were free of their contract with Century, and chose to sign to Emetic Records (with their fifth and current bassist, Gary Mader) for the release of their 2005 stop-gap compilation album, ''[[Preaching the "End-Time" Message]]'', much in the vein of ''Southern Discomfort'', but this time with some unreleased studio tracks.

===Activity and personnel since 2005 (2005-13)===
Following the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], singer [[Mike Williams (Singer)|Mike Williams]] and his now ex-girlfriend Alicia Morgan (a member of [[sludge metal]] band, 13) were arrested in [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] on a [[narcotics]] charge. Williams spent 91 days in the [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] Jail, and kicked his heroin habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Capper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/mar/19/13 |title=Appetite for destruction &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date=2006-03-19 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Capper |first=Andy |url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n10/htdocs/god.php |title=Godhateseye &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Viceland.com |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120004456/http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n10/htdocs/god.php |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of his Eyehategod bandmates and supporters such as [[Phil Anselmo]], Williams was released from jail on December 2, 2005. The band played a set at the 2006 [[Mardi Gras]] festival, the first since the disaster. Emetic Records released a various artists [[tribute album]] to Eyehategod on March 20, 2007, titled ''[[For the Sick]]''. On August 29, 2008, the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with a show at One Eyed Jacks in New Orleans. The band played a few shows in the American South in May 2009, and are on tour the same winter. They also performed at [[Hellfest Summer Open Air|Hellfest]] in France in June.

Jimmy Bower announced in an interview that Eyehategod are still active and preparing a new album. The band played at the Inferno festival in Oslo, Norway, on 1 April 2010, and also played two sets at the Roadburn festival later that month.  Eyehategod performed a new song called "New Orleans Is the New Vietnam" during their set at their July 1, 2011 show in [[Roskilde Festival]], Denmark.

Drummer Joey LaCaze died on August 23, 2013 from respiratory failure.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Tiger |[http://louderthanhell.net/bands/united-states/eyehategod/news/2013/08/24/144121/drummer-joey-lacaze-dies/%20 "Drummer Joey LaCaze Dies"] |[http://www.louderthanhell.net/ Louder Than Hell.net] |August 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/ Earsplit PR] issued a press release on the life and death of LaCaze.  The release states,  "Doctors confirmed to family members that the cause of death was respiratory failure. He also suffered from long term asthma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louderthanhell.net/|title=Parked Domain|website=www.louderthanhell.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had recently come back from a European tour and had celebrated his 42nd birthday.

On October 31, 2013, the band announced that Aaron Hill would be taking LaCaze's place as drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/eyehategod-new-drummer/|title=Eyehategod Reveal New Drummer Following Death of Joey LaCaze|website=Loudwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Eyehategod'' and next album (2014-present)===
In May 2014 the band released a self-titled full-length album on Phil Anselmo's label, Housecore Records. This album is the last featuring Joey LaCaze on drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19381-eyehategod-eyehategod/|title=Eyehategod: Eyehategod Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2016, Williams announced Phil Anselmo would be filling in for him at a show in New Orleans and the 7th annual GwarBBQ. Williams cited "serious health issues" that prevented him from being physically able to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OfficialEyeHateGod/posts/10155051178870961|title=EYEHATEGOD - via Mike IX and the Southern Nihilism Front:... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2016, Earsplit PR announced that Randy Blythe of Lamb of God would be filling in for Williams for the entire duration of the following month’s tour with Discharge and Toxic Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/2016/09/22/eyehategod-randy-blythe-to-fill-in-for-mike-ix-williams-on-upcoming-us-tour-with-discharge-and-toxic-holocaust/|title=EYEHATEGOD: Randy Blythe To Fill In For Mike IX Williams On Upcoming US Tour With Discharge And Toxic Holocaust {{!}} Earsplit Compound|website=www.earsplitcompound.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2016, Williams underwent liver transplant surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youcaring.com/mikeixwilliams-695413|title=Click here to support Help Mike IX live IX lives #YouCaringGives  #IXlivesIXLives|website=YouCaring|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyehategod is currently working on a new album, which they hope to release in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EYEHATEGOD Frontman Says Guitarist BRIAN PATTON Quit Band To Focus On Family Life|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/eyehategod-frontman-says-guitarist-brian-patton-quit-band-to-focus-on-family-life/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 9, 2018|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outlaw Order==
While Jimmy Bower was busy playing drums for [[Down (band)|Down]], the other four members of Eyehategod formed a side-project called '''Outlaw Order''' (abbreviated to '''OO%'''). The band released a limited edition [[7"]] [[Extended play|EP]] in 2003 called ''[[Legalize Crime]]'', which has since been re-released on CD with a bonus live track and is available through Eyehategod's webstore. The criminal theme is apparently because at the time of the band's formation all 5 of the members were on [[probation]], and have consistently been in trouble with the law. Mark Shultz is currently serving a prison sentence and so has been replaced by Justin Grisoli. The band have recorded their debut full-length, ''[[Dragging Down the Enforcer]]'', and it was released on November 10, 2008, through [[Season of Mist]].

A '''fibula''' (/ˈfɪbjʊlə/, plural '''fibulae''' /ˈfɪbjʊli/) is a brooch or pin for fastening garments. The fibula developed in a variety of shapes, but all were based on the [[safety-pin]] principle.  Technically, the Latin term, [[wikt:fibula#Latin|fibulae]], refers to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] brooches; however, the term is widely used to refer to brooches from the entire [[ancient]] and [[early medieval]] world that continue Roman forms. Nevertheless, its use in English is more restricted than in other languages, and in particular post-Roman brooches from the [[British Isles]] are just called brooches (for example, the [[penannular brooch]]es), where in German they would probably be ''fibulae''.

[[File:Bronze_cloak_pin_ca._2200_BC.jpg|thumb|upright|A cloak pin]]
Unlike most modern brooches, fibulae were not only decorative; they originally served a practical function: to fasten [[clothes|clothing]], such as [[cloak]]s. Fibulae replaced straight [[pin]]s that were used to fasten clothing in the [[Neolithic]] period and the [[Bronze Age]]. In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by [[button]]s in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern safety pin, remains in use today. In [[ancient Rome]] and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the [[fibula|fibula bone]] because a popular form for brooches and the shape of the bone were thought to resemble one another.

There are hundreds of different types of fibulae. They are usually divided into families that are based upon historical periods, geography, and/or cultures. Fibulae are also divided into classes that are based upon their general forms.

Lost fibulae, usually fragments, are frequently dug up by amateur coin and relic hunters using [[metal detector]]s.

== Construction ==

Most fibulae are made of [[bronze]] (more properly "[[copper]] [[alloy]]") or [[iron]], or both. Some fibulae are made of [[precious metal]]s such as [[silver]] or [[gold]]. Most fibulae are made of only one or two pieces. Many fibulae are decorated with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[semi-precious stone]]s, [[glass]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]] or [[bone]].

== Components ==
[[File:Silver fibula (brooch) from Værløse, Zealand, Denmark (DR EM85;123).jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Elder Futhark]] [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscription on the pinholder of the 3rd-century AD [[Værløse Fibula]] followed by a [[swastika]].]]
Fibulae were composed of four components: The body, pin, spring, and hinge.

===Body===
The body of a fibula is known as either the bow or the plate, depending on the basic form. A bow is generally long and narrow, and often arched. A plate is flat and wide. Plates could be solid or openwork. The body was often decorated. The head is the end of the fibula with the [[Spring (device)|spring]] or [[hinge]]. The foot is the end of the fibula where the pin closes. Depending on the type of fibula, and the [[culture]] in question, the head of the fibula could be worn facing up, down or sideways.

===Pin===
The pin that is used to fasten the [[clothing]] is either a continuation of the fibula's body or a separate piece attached to the body. The fibula is closed by connecting the end of the pin to a catch plate, or pin rest.

===Spring===
The body and pin meet at either a spring or [[hinge]]. The earliest design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around in one direction only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs wind in one or more loops on one side of the pin and then cross over or under the bow and continue with more loops on the other side. They appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending from one end of the spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral springs wrap around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.

===Hinge===
In the late 1st century BC or early 1st century AD a new design appeared in some bow type fibulae. A separate pin was attached to the head-end of the bow with a small hinge. In the second half of the 1st century AD, hinges were introduced to plate type fibulae. One or two small plaques were cast on the back of the plate and a pin was attached to them by a small hinge. Previously, plate type fibulae had bilateral springs attached to the back. In the 3rd century AD, the hinge was placed in the centre of a long transverse bar creating the famous [[crossbow]] fibula design. A few fibulae from a much earlier date also had hinges, although this design feature was very rare and soon died out for nearly five centuries. For example, the [[Asia Minor]] Decorated Arc Fibula (Blinkenberg Type XII Variation 16) dating to the 5th century BC.

It is important to note that different types of fibula construction were used contemporaneously. Though the introduction of the hinge was later than the introduction of the spring, the spring remained in use long after the hinge was introduced. Therefore, a given fibula with hinge is not necessarily more recent than one with a spring.

== Use ==

Fibulae were originally used to fasten [[clothing]]. They represent an improvement on the earlier straight [[pin]] which was less secure and could fall out. While the head of the earlier straight pin was often decorated, the bow or plate of the fibula provided a much increased scope for decoration. Among some [[culture]]s, different fibula designs had specific [[symbolic meaning]]s. They could refer to a status or profession such as single woman, married woman, man, warrior, or chief. Some Roman-era fibulae may symbolize specific ranks or positions in the [[Roman legion]]s or auxiliary. In some cultures, fibulae were worn in pairs and could be linked by a length of chain. The Romans also used [[fibula (penile)|fibulas to fasten the foreskin]] above the penis, thus hiding the glans, this was done both to show modesty and in the belief that it helped preserve the voice.

== Historical development ==

=== Bronze Age fibulae ===
[[File:Fibulae01.JPG|right|thumb|Early fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;10th – 8th centuries BC]]

'''The first fibulae design''', violin bow fibulae (''drahtbugel'' in German), appeared in the [[late Bronze Age]]. This simple design, with a unilateral spring, looks remarkably like a modern [[safety pin]]. The violin bow fibula has a low flat arch; the body runs parallel to the pin so it resembles a [[violin]] bow. The bow could be round, square, or flat and ribbon-like in cross-section. Some had simple punched or incised decoration on the bow. Violin bow fibula, such as the Peschiera type and the Unter-Radl type, was introduced in the 14th century BC (Late Mycenean III era) by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]]s on the Greek [[Peloponnesus]]. The fibula soon spread to [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] trading posts in [[Sicily]].

There were several variants of the violin bow fibula. The bow could bend, or [[zig-zag]] from side to side while still remaining flat and parallel to the pin. These variants, such as the Grunwald type and the Hanua type, were found in the 12th and 11th centuries BC. In another variant, the bow, while still flat, widened out into an oval or diamond shape (blattbugel in German). These variants, such as the Kreuznach type and Reisen type, were found in the 12th to 10th centuries BC.
[[File:Violin bow fibula .jpg|thumb|10th century BC]]

'''The second major design''' of fibulae has a high, rounded [[arch]] (''bogen'' in German) instead of the low flat arch of the violin bow fibula. At first, the bow was thin. In later variants the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of thin [[wire]] twisted together. These rounded bow fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places for more than five centuries.
[[File:Fibulae02.JPG|right|thumb|Early bow fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;8th – 6th centuries BC]]

'''The third Bronze Age design''' of fibula consisted of horizontal wire [[spiral]]s. The spectacle fibula (brillen in German) consisted of two spirals joined together. It resembles a pair of [[spectacles]] or eye [[glasses]]. These fibulae, such as the Haslau type and the St. Lucija type, were found in the 9th to 7th centuries BC. Some spectacle fibula were very large with spirals up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm across. A variant that appeared in the 6th century BC had four small spirals with a square, or squarish, cover plate on the middle, the Vierpass type.

The [[Villanovan culture]] in [[Italy]] introduced a series of variations of the bow fibula in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In these so-called Italianate fibulae, the bow begins, at the head, with a semi-circular form, but bends at its apex to angle straight down to the foot that was often lengthened and extended. The bow was often decorated with moulded knobs or spikes. The rear half of the bow was sometimes bent into a wavy, kinked shape. The latter variants were known as [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] fibulae.

Meanwhile, the 8th and 7th centuries BC saw the introduction of the so-called [[Phrygia]]n bow fibulae in [[Asia Minor]]. These fibulae had a near-perfect semi-circular arch sometimes decorated with knobs or round flanges. In the same period, the Hand or Arm fibula spread from [[Cyprus]], where it appears to have originated, to [[Syria]], [[Assyria]] and [[Persia]]. In this design the bow was bent 90 degrees at the apex giving the fibula a [[triangular]] shape when viewed from the side. The bow was usually decorated with a series of rings and dots. The catch plate usually had the form of a hand, making the entire fibula resemble an arm.

In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, a series of variations of the bow fibula appeared in the southern [[Balkans]], known variously as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], or [[Thracian]] bow fibulae. The high arched bow of these fibulae had large fins or knobs. The bow usually ended in a very large triangular or square catch plate. Some of the large square catch plates were decorated with complex incised [[geometric]] or figural designs. Some of the fibula had a flat back indicating that they were likely cast in simple, open [[mould]]s.

=== Iron Age fibulae ===

The [[Iron Age]] saw an expansion in the use of fibulae. The rounded bow fibula underwent several variations and were usually highly decorated with incised or moulded [[geometric]] designs. In one variation, the foot of the fibula that had previously terminated at the end of the arch with a simple catch plate, lengthened significantly. These extended foot fibulae, such as the Kahn type and the Pauken type, were found in the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The first long, bilateral springs appeared on some of these variants in the [[Hallstatt]] D2 era (5th century BC). These fibulae, such as the Doublezier type, looked similar to the Roman-era [[crossbow]] fibulae but were not the latter’s direct precursor.

[[File:Fibulae03.JPG|right|thumb|More early fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;7th – 5th centuries BC]]
[[File:Dacian fibulae Cluj Musem 1st century BC.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Typical silver Dacian fibulae 1st century BC (Museum of Transylvania Cluj Romania]]

In another variation of the rounded bow fibula, the bow became fat and swollen-looking. In many of these [[Leech]] Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the catch plate became large and triangular. Another variant, the Certossa type, had a small square or ribbon cross-section bow and a short bilateral spring (possibly the first use of a bilateral spring). Certossa fibulae are almost always very small.

In the [[La Tene]] I, or La Tene A to B2, era (4th to 3rd centuries BC), fibula design became relatively standardised over a large geographic area, although minor stylistic variations and differences in decoration remained. The La Tene I fibula usually had a narrow bow. The spring that could be either unilateral or bilateral, was wound in a fairly large diameter circle. The foot was turned up and usually ended in a decorated knob or with an applied [[bead]] or stone. In some cases the raised foot was bent back towards the bow, although it did not touch the bow. The Thraco-Getic fibula is a variant found in the eastern [[Balkans]] and used by the [[Getae]]. The fibula's foot is vertical and ends in a small knob, though later models had a sinuous, s-shaped profile.

[[File:La Tene, Thraco-Getic and Nauheim Fibulae.jpg|right|thumb|La Tene era fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;4th – 1st centuries BC]]

The La Tene I era also saw the introduction of the first animal, or [[zoomorphic]], designs. These included [[birds]] and [[horse]]s and could either be flat, with a short bilateral spring on the back, or [[dimension|three-dimensional]] ("in the round") with a long bilateral spring at the head.

In the La Tene II, or La Tene C era (2nd century BC), the foot of the fibula actually bent back to touch the bow and was wrapped around it. Many La Tene II fibulae had long bilateral springs. It is important to be aware that this type of construction was in use several centuries later in the tied-foot and returned-foot types of fibulae. These latter types are sometimes known as pseudo-La Tene fibulae.

In the La Tene III, or La Tene D era (1st century BC), the raised foot was no longer wrapped around the bow but was attached directly to it by [[casting]] or [[welding]] creating a loop above the foot. In one variant, the Nauheim type, the bow widened into a flat triangle or diamond. In another variant, the Schussel type, the ribbon-like bow widened at the head into a rounded [[arrowhead]] shape that covered the spring.

===Roman-era fibulae===

====The 1st century AD====

File:Fibulae08.JPG|Kraftig Profilierte fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;1st – 2nd centuries AD
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The rapid spread of the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century AD resulted in a tremendous growth in the number and design of fibulae throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]]. The spread of technologically advanced workshops in the Roman Empire led to more complex fibula designs. Bows were cast in more complex forms, hinges appeared alongside bilateral springs and a wide variety of plate designs were introduced.

One of the first fibula designs of the Roman-era began in the [[La Tene]] III era, in the late 1st century BC. The Straight Wire fibula, also known as the Soldier’s type or [[Roman legion|Legionnaire]]'s type, is a very plain design. It resembles the violin bow fibula of over one thousand years earlier except that the bow has slightly more of an arch and the spring in (short) bilateral not unilateral. The Straight Wire fibula is found through the 1st century AD.

In the 1st century AD, for the first time, several fibula designs originated in [[Roman Britain]]. Perhaps the most distinctive British fibula design was the Dolphin. This was actually a series of designs including the Polden Hill type, the Langton Down type, the Colchester type and the T-Shaped type. Dolphin fibulae have a smooth arched bow that tapers from the head to end in a long point. The long bilateral spring is covered. From the top the Dolphin fibula looks like a T or the late-Roman [[crossbow]] fibula. From the side it resembles a leaping [[dolphin]].

[[File:Fibulae09.JPG|150px|thumb|Roman era plate fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;1st century AD]]
Another British design was the Hod Hill type. Usually quite small, Hod Hill fibulae have a shallow arched bow that appears to be made up of lumpy segments. Many Hod Hill fibulae have a pair of small side [[lug (knob)|lug]]s.

The Fantail fibula, which have a short bow that flares into a flat, wide fan-shaped foot, were common in Britain and on the European continent. The Fantail design lasted into the 2nd century AD. A common and widespread design was the Augen (or Eye) fibula, which has a longer bow and a long, flat, wide foot. It has a short bilateral spring. Many Augen fibulae are decorated with a pair of ringed dots, or eyes, on the flat foot. Augen fibulae appear to have been introduced to the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Germanic peoples]], notably [[Marcomanni]], serving as [[Roman auxiliaries]].

The Aucissa fibula was another widespread design. It has a high semi-circular arched bow that extended into a short foot. The bow is flat and wide and has a rounded central ridge. The bow ends, at the head, in a hinge. The Aucissa was one of the first fibulae to use a hinge instead of a spring. The foot ends in a rounded knob. Many Aucissa fibulae have the word “AVCISSA” moulded above the hinge. This is thought to be the name of a [[workshop]].

The 1st century AD saw several other bow variations. The Wolf or Wolf’s Head fibula has a flat, ribbon-like bow that widens into a square section at the head. The common design of two circles and a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] near the rear of the bow is often interpreted as a [[wolf]]’s head. The [[Thracian]] Anchor type has a wide [[crescent]] at the head giving the fibula an [[anchor]] shape. The Thracian Anchor type is also called the Illyrian and is found in [[Pannonia]] ([[Hungary]]), [[Dacia]] ([[Romania]]) and [[Serbia]].

The late 1st century AD saw the introduction of the Kraftig Profilierte group of fibula designs. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae have a wide fan-, or [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped head and a long thin pointy foot. They have long bilateral hinges. There are three main variations of the Kraftig Profilierte fibula. The North Pannonian Double Knot type, found in [[Pannonia]] has two knobs, or knots, on the bow. The Single Knot type, found in the central [[Balkans]], has a single knob. The Black Sea type, found in the [[steppes]] north of the [[Black Sea]], has a thin body, with no flaring near the head, and two knots. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae were found in the late 1st to late 2nd centuries AD and are mostly associated with the [[Przeworsk]] proto-[[Goths|Gothic]] culture.

The 1st century AD saw the widespread use of plate fibulae. Plate fibulae consist of a flat plate. Since there is little space between the fibula body and the pin (there is no arch to the body), plate fibulae could not be used to fasten much material and were therefore mainly [[decorative]]. Most plate fibulae have a hinge assembly on the back. Plate fibulae are generally associated with women’s [[Grave (burial)|grave]]s. The most common forms of plate fibula in the 1st century AD were round (disc), diamond, oval and lunula ([[crescent]]- or moon-shaped).

==== The 2nd century AD ====

&lt;gallery widths="200px" perrow="4"&gt;

File:Fibulae12.JPG|Tutulus plate fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;2nd – 3rd centuries AD
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Roman Britain]] the fibula designs common in the 1st century AD continued to some extent into the second, although usually in more complex variations. A new design, the Head Stud type, has a long bow with a [[wikt:stud#Etymology 2|stud]], or occasionally a ring, at the head.

The Knee fibula, a common design in the 2nd century AD, originated in Roman [[Pannonia]] (modern [[Hungary]]). With its short, fat bow that incorporates a 90 degree bend, [[archeologists]] thought it resembled a [[knee]] and leg. Many Knee fibulae have small rectangular, or larger semi-circular head plates. Knee fibulae appear, like the Augen type, to have been introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] allies. Despite their small size, their appearance in [[Roman military]] graves implies that the Knee fibula was the most popular fibula among Roman soldiers in the 2nd century AD. They are rarely found outside military sites or contexts.

The Pannonian Trumpet fibula has a wide flaring head like the bell of a [[trumpet]]. However, unlike a straight trumpet, the Pannonian Trumpet fibula is sharply bent near the head. This [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] design was found in and around [[Pannonia]] but was exported as widely as [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

The P-Shaped type is another common 2nd-century AD fibula design that originated among the [[Germanic peoples]]. The P-Shaped fibula, or Almgren Type 162, has a semi-circular arch and a long foot that curves back under itself to return to the base of the arch. They have bilateral springs. The bows of P-Shaped fibulae are usually semi-circular in cross-section and are decorated with ribs. P-Shaped fibulae were found from the 2nd to the early 4th centuries.

There were other bow fibula variations of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The Divided Bow type has an arched bow and a long foot. The arch was made up of two, or even three, separate, but parallel, arches. These arches are either wide and flat or narrow and tall. The Trident fibula has a rounded arch and long foot and a wide, flat head plate with three points. The entire fibula looks like a [[trident]]. Claims that this was the standard fibula of the [[Roman navy]] are unfounded.

The use of plate fibulae continued in the 2nd century CE. Simple flat shapes were replaced with [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] versions or more complex shapes. These included animal ([[zoomorphic]]) shapes ([[birds]], [[horses]], [[rabbits]], flies, etc.), letters or words, abstract [[symmetrical]] or [[asymmetrical]] designs (including the so-called [[Celt]]ic Trumpet designs), and [[skeuomorphic]] designs ([[symbol]]ic designs). Most designs continued in use throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries. In one later variation during this time, the Tutulus type, the circular disc plate was extended upwards to form a [[cone]].

====The 3rd to 4th centuries AD====

The use of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]led [[inlay]] continued until the end of the 3rd century AD.

[[File:Fibulae13.JPG|right|thumb|P-shaped fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;3rd – 5th centuries AD]]

A variation of the P-shaped fibula, the tied foot fibula has a foot that returns to the bow but then wraps, or ties, around the bow. Many Tied Foot fibulae have long bilateral springs. The tied foot fibula was found in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD and is associated with the [[Wielbark Culture|Wielbark]] [[Goths|Gothic]] culture.

The classic fibula of the late-Roman era, and in fact the best known of all fibula types, is the [[crossbow]] type. The crossbow fibula consists of a highly arched semi-circular bow, usually of squarish cross-section, and a long flat foot. The fibula has a wide transverse bar (or arms) at the head containing the pin-hinge. Crossbow fibulae usually have three round or onion-shaped knobs: one at the head and one at each end of the transverse bar.

[[File:Fibulae15.JPG|left|thumb|Crossbow fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;3rd – 5th centuries AD]]

The first crossbow fibulae, from the early 3rd century AD, has short, thin arms, no knobs, a long bow and a short foot. The later crossbow fibulae have been divided into groups by several [[archeologist]]s including Keller, Prottel and Soupault. Type I, dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries, has small, simple knobs and a foot that is shorter than the bow. Type II, dating to the 4th century, has larger knobs and a foot that is approximately the same length as the bow. Type III, also dating to the 4th century, has a foot that is longer than the bow. There are several variants of the Type III based on the decoration of the foot: dotted circles, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s, or [[curlicue]]s. Another variant, dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, the Bugelkopf type, has no transverse bar, or arms at all but retains the round knob at the head.

=== Post-Roman fibulae ===

[[File:Fibulae16.JPG|right|thumb|Post-Roman fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;5th – 10th centuries AD]]
[[File:Brooches.JPG|left|thumb|High status Frankish brooches in the [[British Museum]], France 5th Century AD]]
There are numerous types of post-Roman fibulae. The so-called [[Goths|Gothic]] group of bow fibulae have a round or triangular flat head plate, often with 3, 5 or 7 knobs, a small arched bow and a long flat diamond shaped foot. They were widely used by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]], and [[Gepids]], and the non-Germanic [[Slavs]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], and are found over a wide part of southern and western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. There are also a wide variety of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] fibulae from the 5th to 7th century such as the equal-arm type and the small-long type. Most [[Viking]] fibulae are variations on the ring or annular design (see below).

=== Ring fibulae and penannular brooches ===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|left|The pseudo-penannular  [[Tara Brooch]], the most ornate of Irish brooches, also decorated on the back (see article). Early 8th century.]]
{{main article|Penannular brooch}}

The ring, or annular, fibula or brooch is extremely hard to date as the design for utilitarian pieces was almost unchanged from the 2nd to the 14th centuries AD. If there is decoration, this is likely to indicate whether a given ring fibula is Roman-era fibula or a  medieval brooch.

The [[penannular brooch]], with an incomplete ring and two terminals, originally a common utilitarian clothes fastening, normally of [[base metal]], in Iron Age and [[Roman Britain]] developed in the post-Roman period into highly elaborate and decorative marks of status in Ireland and Scotland, made in precious metals and often decorated with gems, and worn by men and women, as well as the clergy as part of their [[vestment]]s when conducting services.  The finest period is from the 8th and 9th centuries, before the Vikings disrupted the societies.  Ornate Irish examples in the period are usually "pseudo-penannular"; in fact closed rings, but imitating the penannular form.  Examples like the [[Tara Brooch]] are among the most spectacular pieces of jewellery of the Early Medieval period. When the Vikings began to raid and settle the British Isles, they took to wearing these brooches, but now in plain silver.  The thistle and bossed types were the most popular styles, both developing out of earlier Celtic styles.  The post-Roman types are not called "fibulae" in English, though they are in other languages.

=== Medieval brooches ===
[[File:Bulesølje med Hellig Olaf.JPG|thumb| Brooch of gilded silver featuring  Saint Olav in the center with an ax in his left hand.  ([[National Museum of Denmark]] in Copenhagen)]] 
There is a huge variety of [[medieval]] brooch types (the term fibula is rarely used for medieval items). The two most common are ring brooches, including square and lobed or flower designs as well as round ones, and flat plate brooches, or [[badge]]s, in the form of people or animals, with specialized types such as [[pilgrim badge]]s or [[livery badge]]s, which were often produced in large quantities in cheap metals such as lead, but also in very expensive forms such as the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]].  However these are mostly purely decorative, or worn to denote something about the wearer, and were probably not much used for fastening.

==History==

Footnote was founded in 1985 by Wellington ballet teacher Deirdre Tarrant with a 'dual commitment to fostering original works by local choreographers and composers, and establishing dance workshops in schools'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schultz|first1=Marianne|title=Contemporary dance - New companies and international work, 1990s to 2000s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/contemporary-dance/page-4|website=Te Ara - Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarrant had recently returned from dancing overseas; her vision was to 'establish a real community of creative dance people as well as to develop contemporary dance in New Zealand'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Judson|first1=Natasha|title=Deirdre Tarrant to leave Footnote|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/6423485/Deirdre-Tarrant-to-leave-Footnote|website=DominionPost|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has played an important role in establishing and supporting contemporary dance in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ian|first1=Lochhead|title=Footnote put best foot forward|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/arts/71621891/footnote-put-best-foot-forward|website=DominionPost|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footnote received government funding: in the early 1990s it shifted from project-based funding to receiving recurrent funding through [[Creative New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Up"&gt;{{cite web|title=Up, up and away, 1991|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/42596/up-up-and-away-1991|website=Te Ara - Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Footnote established its 'Forte' season, where a New Zealand dance artists working internationally was brought back to New Zealand to create a new work for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rae|first1=Bernadette|title=Three decades of dance have fitting celebration|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment-reviews/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502967&amp;objectid=11531033|accessdate=7 May 2016|agency=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dancers and choreographers who have worked with Footnote include Michael Parmenter, Shona McCullagh, Raewyn Hill, Malia Johnston, Raewyn Hill and Ross McCormack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rae|first1=Bernadette|title=Footnote Dance at 30|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11479336|website=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company regularly tours in New Zealand, and has performed in Shanghai, Berlin, Brussels, Antwerp and London.&lt;ref name ='Horsley'/&gt;

'''''Frenzy of Exultations''''' (Szał uniesień), or better known as just '''''Frenzy''''' (Szał), is an 1893 painting by Polish artist, [[Władysław Podkowiński]], and is credited as the most famous work in his output. It is considered the first work of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in Polish art, during a period when [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|Poland]] was partitioned between its neighbours: Russia, Germany and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/12345/news |title=The Best of Polish Painting on Display in Poznań |newspaper=The Warsaw Voice news |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The painting shows a [[naked]], [[red hair|redheaded]] [[woman]] riding a black, frenetic [[horse]]. The horse reveals its teeth, and its tongue hangs out. Its nostrils are dilated and foam runs from its mouth. The woman riding the horse clasps its neck with her eyes closed, her loose hair fans out and flows upwards to mingle with the horse's mane. The canvas is over 3&amp;nbsp;meters in height, resulting in life sized figures. This painting is said to depict female [[orgasm]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm|title=Orgasm|newspaper=Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia|accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The colour range is quite narrow and is composed of blacks, browns and grays contrasting with the white and yellow. The image is divided into light and dark parts. The upper left corner is illuminated, directing attention to a clear figure of a woman and the horse's mouth. The right side of the painting shows whirled darkness in which the horse's hind and tail can be seen.

==Background==
The concept of this work dates back to Podkowiński's stay in [[Paris]] in 1889, but the emergence of successive oil sketches and charcoal studies in the second half of 1893 was the consequence of the growing drama of unrequited love in the artist's life. In his vision, Podkowiński elevates erotic ecstasy to an absolute value, regarding it, in accordance with the [[psychologism]] current for that time, as the cosmic power and determinant of the human condition. Setting about the execution of the huge painting, he employed the academic method of preparatory [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es that correspond to the final version, while differing slightly one from another in size and colour. Reduced in colour scheme, they range from the ultramarine version (lost), through work enlivened with green, to the subsequent ones, in which intense orange predominates. The avalanche of stones was removed from the final version as well. In comparison with the sketches, the final, monumental composition gained in dynamism and the previously weak contrast of colour intensified to that between golden and black, and the tension between light and shadow was more polarised. This could be an effect of his private life drama and the progress of his lung disease.

==History==
[[File:Kamieński-Podkowinski malujący Szał.jpg|thumb|''Władysław Podkowiński Painting "Frenzy"'' by [[Antoni Kamieński]], 1895]]
Podkowiński started to paint in [[Warsaw]] between 1893 and 1894. The creation process lasted at least three months, and according to a friend, the terminally ill Podkowiński "was painting from his bed" as he finished the work. The painting was shown at the [[Zachęta]] exhibition on 18 March 1894.&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trochimczyk|first=Maja|title=Paderewski in Poetry: Master of Harmonies or Poland's Savior?|journal=Polish Music Journal|date=Summer 2001|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/PMJ/issue/4.1.01/paderewskipoems.html|accessdate=22 March 2014|issn=1521-6039|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023114942/http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/PMJ/issue/4.1.01/paderewskipoems.html|archivedate=23 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was accompanied by an atmosphere of sensationalism and scandal;&lt;ref name=PMJ/&gt; however, approximately 12,000 people saw the picture, earning nearly 350 [[ruble]]s for the gallery.

Despite the success of the painting, Podkowiński could not find a willing buyer: 3000 rubles were offered, but Podkowiński had asked for 10,000.

On the morning of 23 April 1894, 36 days since the exhibition's opening and just before its planned end, Podkowiński came to the exhibition and slashed the painting with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Różewicz|first=Tadeusz|title=Sobbing Superpower: Selected Poems of Tadeusz Różewicz|page=347|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XYpsUmnVfowC&amp;pg=PA347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this act are unclear.

Podkowiński's act of desecration may have contributed to the rumours that the image portrayed a woman towards which the artist had an unfulfilled affection. The damage of the image, and Podkowiński's death soon afterwards fuelled the speculation of his death being a suicide. Providing a rationale for this explanation are the traces of cuts on the canvas showing that only the image of the woman was subject to the attack. The object of the artist's feelings could be Ewa Kotarbińska, whom he met during his summer stay in a palace near Warsaw. She was a brunette, but some{{Who|date=August 2011}} record that her family saw a similarity between her and the woman in the painting and harshly condemned him.

After Podkowiński's death the painting was restored by Witold Urbański. The restored work was lent to other exhibitions in [[Łódź]], [[Kraków]], [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Finally, the canvas was purchased by Feliks Jasieński in 1901 for 1,000 rubles, and in 1904 was given to the [[National Museum, Kraków|National Museum in Kraków]].

'''''Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi''''' ({{Lang-fr|La Grèce sur les ruines de Missolonghi}}) is an 1826 oil painting by French painter [[Eugène Delacroix]], and now preserved at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux]]. This painting was inspired by the [[Third Siege of Missolonghi]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (''sortie'') to escape [[famine]] and [[epidemics]]. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.

==Analysis==
Greece is depicted as a kneeling woman who occupies the major part of the painting. She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peinture XIXe siècle |url=http://www.framemuseums.org/jsp/fiche_oeuvre.jsp?STNAV=&amp;RUBNAV=&amp;CODE=O114984527052351&amp;LANGUE=0&amp;RH=MUSEEsFR&amp;OBJET_PROVENANCE=COLLECTION |publisher=[[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux]] |language=French |accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting borrows elements from [[Christianity]]. Indeed, "Greece adopts the attitude of praying in the early centuries of Christianity. The blue coat and white robe, traditionally attributed to the [[Immaculate Conception]], reinforces this analogy to a secular figure of [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] here. The strength of the image is the sharp contrast between the traditional allegory which induces an idealization of the model, and processing of the scene without any concession to the ideal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=L'ABCdaire de Delacroix |first=Alain |last=Daguerre de Hureaux |year=1998 |publisher=Flammarion |place=Luçon |page=96 |language=French |isbn=2-08-012578-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Walrus - WGA07101.jpg|thumb|340px|''Head of a Walrus'', 1521. Pen drawing in Indian ink and watercolor on paper]]

'''''Head of a Walrus''''' (German: '''''Kopf eines Walrosses''''') is a 1521 pen [[drawing]] and [[watercolour]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. At the time the [[walrus]]' main European population was around Scandinavia, and they were exotic to inland Europeans. As such the work reflects Dürer fascination with what he perceived as unusual animals, with similarly intentioned works including depictions of lions and [[Dürer's Rhinoceros|rhinoceros]].  The drawing created as part of a larger series of 167 drawings of [[quadruped]]s.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; 

The drawing is generally considered as not successful;&lt;ref name="b90"&gt;Berger (1996), 90&lt;/ref&gt; and is viewed as curious attempted depiction that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor anatomically true to life. Art historians assume the artist drew it from memory having viewed a dead example during a 1520 visit to [[Zeeland]] to see a stranded [[whale]] which had decomposed before his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Stanska, Zuzanna. "[http://www.dailyartmagazine.com/images-durers-animals/ Images Of Dürer’s Animals That Are Better Than A Trip To The Zoo]". ''DailyArt Magazine'', 21  July 2016. Retrieved 22 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the depiction departure for nature, Durer's animal has been described as "amusing...it looks more like a hairless puppy with tusks. When Dürer drew from life his accuracy was unquestionable, but he had only briefly seen a walrus, and had only fleeting memory and an elaborate verbal description from which to reconstruct the image".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe; Laseau (1986), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawing is inscribed with the words "1521 / Das dosig thÿr van dem jch do das hawbt / contrefett hab ist gefangen worden / jn die niderlendischen see vnd / was XII ellen lang / brawendisch mit für fusse", which were for many years loosely translated to English as "1521, That stupid (or dozy) animal of which I have portrayed the head was caught in the Netherlands sea and was twelve brabant ells long with four feet", although the interpretation of "dosig thÿr" as ''stupid'' or ''dozy'' is no longer necessarily held, and it may have that the text instead should be inferred as "dasig" or "hiesig", as in "represented here".&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

The original is in the [[British Museum]], London.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;"[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=720549&amp;partId=1&amp;images=true The Head of a Walrus]".

The '''Heatherley School of Fine Art''' is an independent [[art school]] in London. 

The school was named after Thomas Heatherley who took over as the school's principal from [[James Mathews Leigh]] (when it was named "Leigh's").  Founded in 1845, the school is affectionately known as Heatherley's. It is one of the oldest independent art schools in London and is among the few art colleges in Britain that focus on portraiture, [[Figurative art|figurative painting]] and sculpture.

It opened a new school, on George Street (off [[Baker Street]]), London, in November 1927 after previously being located on Newman Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Dewar On Art |url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000483%2f19271104%2f135 |work=Kent &amp; Sussex Courier |date=4 November 1927 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Russell Flint]], [[Solomon Joseph Solomon]], [[Gregoire Boonzaier]], [[Michael Ayrton]] and [[Kate Greenaway]] are numbered amongst its former students as was the first Principal of the [[Slade School of Art]], [[Edward Poynter|Sir Edward Poynter]].

'''''House of Rock''''' is a satirical [[animation]] that aired on the UK's [[Channel 4]] from 2000 to 2002. It revolved around the afterlives of some of the world's most famous dead rock stars, including [[Freddie Mercury]], [[John Denver]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Marc Bolan]]. Bolan was replaced in the second series by [[John Lennon]]. Forced to share a house in [[limbo]], they try to cope with isolation, clashing personalities and relentless boredom.

The show aired as part of Channel 4's late-night 4 Music. Often, segments of the episode would appear as links between videos, reminiscent of [[Beavis and Butthead]]. On average, each episode from the first series was 5 minutes long, while each episode from the second series was 10 minutes long.

The characters occupy a huge rundown house in a bleak, depressing landscape with nothing around seemingly for miles. Much of the comedy comes from each character's frustrations with their surroundings, associates and inability to do anything further now they're dead.

==Characters==

===Freddie Mercury===
Extremely theatrical and flamboyant, Freddie is highly strung and quick to anger. He openly despises all of his housemates, especially the Notorious B.I.G. He keeps a cat called Galileo.

===John Denver===
The group's only optimist, John is sweet and naïve, convinced there is some hope of emerging from limbo. As such he is constantly abused and berated by other more cynical housemates. His love of peace has led him to severely suppress his anger. John can often be heard using phrases used in ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', such as "jinkies!"

===Kurt Cobain===
Paranoid and depressed, Kurt is so tired of life he owns a pad of pre-printed suicide notes that he can stick anywhere like [[Post-it notes]]. Nevertheless, he is quite friendly, especially with Biggie and John. Kurt's dream is to be series champion on the UK gameshow ''[[Fifteen to One]]''.

===The Notorious B.I.G.===
Known as "Biggie" within the house, Notorious is especially depressed with limbo, since he has had to leave all the trappings of his [[Hip hop culture|hip-hop]] lifestyle behind. Sometimes his sexual frustration is so great he has to take it out on the house's postman, a constantly shuddering [[Sid Vicious]]. He cannot stand Freddie Mercury, and would have shot him long ago if his gun was capable of doing anything.

===Marc Bolan===
The house's resident [[hippie]], elfin Marc is only capable of talking in [[wiktionary:Twee|twee]] rhyming couplets in the style of his lyrics. Frustrated with his hippie sensibilities and feyness, when Satan [[Davina McCall]] demands one of their number join her in hell ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' style, the group agree on Marc. They are then horrified to discover his replacement is the peace-and-love obsessed John Lennon.

===John Lennon===
John pompous and pretentious, with a droning Scouse voice. He comes with his own Yellow Submarine, which he wears around his waist at all times.

'''James Hunter''' (1755–1792) served as a lieutenant in the [[Royal Artillery]] in British India, serving under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]]. Hunter worked as a military artist, and his sketches portray aspects of military and everyday life. Hunter took part in [[Tippu Sultan]] campaigns and other military campaigns in South India. His paintings provide a picture of late 18th century life in South India.

Hunter has sketched different landscapes of South India, including [[Bangalore]], [[Mysore]], Hosur, [[Kancheepuram]], [[Madras]], [[Arcot]], [[Sriperumbudur|Sriperumbadur]], etc. These paintings were published as the third section of ''A Brief history of ancient and modern India embellished with coloured engravings'' published by Edward Orme (London) between 1802-05, as ''Picturesque Views in the Kingdom of Mysore'' published in 1804.&lt;ref name=Ebinesan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebinesan|first1=J|title=James Hunter's Bangalore|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/18249957@N00/sets/72157594460104089/|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BangaloreFirst"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paintings of Tipu’s death &amp; Hindu temple for auction at UK|url=http://www.bangalorefirst.in/?p=2613|accessdate=24 June 2016|agency=Bangalore First|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BL-Ouscottah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb of a 'Killadar' (governor of a fort) Ouscottah (Mysore)|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000141u00000000.html|website=British Library|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Hunter, with the Royal Artillery in India==
In 1791, a detachment of volunteers was raised from the [[Royal Artillery]] battalions for serving in British India. Two companies were created with a major, adjutant and quarter-master, along with the men. The commanding officer was Major David Scott. Lt. James Hunter, along with Captain T Ross and Lieutenants R Clarke, C Gold and W Nicolay were the sub-ordinate officers. Leaving [[Woolwich]] in early 1791, they arrived at [[Madras]] in October 1791. 

These two companies served under Lord Cornwallis in the Tippu Sultan campaigns, leading to the defeat and siege of Tippu's army at [[Seringapatam]] in 1792. Major Scott, was killed on 9 February 1792, during the campaign. After a peace treaty was signed with Tippu Sultan, Lt. James Hunter, with the assistance of Lt C Gold made sketches of life in India and objects and buildings who attracted their attention. These sketches was published by C Gold with the title ''Oriental Drawings'' and attracted much attention in England as they were considered as valuable addition to British understanding of Indian culture. Lt. Hunter died in May 18 1791 (p.78).&lt;ref name="JABrowne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=James Alexander|title=England's Artillerymen: An Historical Narrative of the Services of the Royal Artillery, from the Formation of the Regiment to the Amalgamation of the Royal and Indian Artilleries in 1862|date=1865|publisher=Hall, Smart and Allen|location=London|pages=330|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WNX6_MkijlEC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=lt.+james+hunter+royal+artillery+1792&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cCdG2l87gm&amp;sig=oolMlNpg_7CU8jd7yrWhrzNZI70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0mdyx2r_NAhXsy4MKHXH3B8wQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=lt.%20james%20hunter%20royal%20artillery%201792&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Hunter Memorial==
James Hunter is buried at the Old Cemetery at [[Vellore]], near Commissary Bazar, [[North Arcot]] District. The memorial monument raised by his brother Arthur Hunter, records his birth day as 15 November 1755 and death day as 19 May 1792. As recorded in 1946, a giant banyan tree had fallen on the memorial (pg.4).&lt;ref name="Cotton-2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=Julian James|editor1-last=Baliga|editor1-first=B S|title=List Of Inscriptions On Tombs Or Monuments Madras: Possessing Historical or Archaeological Interest - Volume II|date=1946|publisher=Government Press|location=Madras, British India|url=https://archive.org/details/ListOfInscriptionsOnTombsOrMonumentsMadrasVol2Cotton|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of Bangalore==
[[Bangalore]] was first recorded in paintings in the 17th Century by European artists, who traveled the South India extensively. One such artist was James Hunter, who sketched extensively on the views of [[Mysore]] and the wars with [[Tippu Sultan]]. After his death in 1792, Joseph C Stadler, J B Harraden and H Merke took up the work of 'aquatint etching' of the paintings on copper plates. Forty of Hunter's paintings were published in London in 1804, by Edward Orme, under the title ''Picturesque scenery in the Kingdom of Mysore''. In comparison to the work of Robert Home, Lt. R H Colebroke Capt. Allan, Hunter’s work are associated often with [[Tipu Sultan]] and his father [[Hyder Ali]] and depicts the military and civil life of Bangalore in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Dukan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Views of Bangalore - 1791 AD by James Hunter|url=http://dukan.co.in/sixviews.aspx?mid=4&amp;msid=19|website=Dukan|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kurkihar hoard''' represents a rare set of 226 bronzes, mostly Buddhist, dating to between the 9th and 12th centuries CE, which were found in  Kurkihar near [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] in the Indian state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm Guy, The "Påala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Volume 10 of Studies in South Asian Culture,  The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Susan L. Huntington  Brill Archive, 1984, p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Kurkihar is situated about 5&amp;nbsp;km. north-east of Wazirgunj, and 27 km east from [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The inscriptions found suggest that Kurkihar was once a well known international pilgrimage center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bhaskar.com/news/BIH-PAT-HMU-buddhist-archaeological-site-kurkihar-5620721-PHO.html जिद धरोहर बचाने की : गया के कुर्किहार के घर-घर में है धरोहर, विदेशों से था संबंध,  Bhaskar News,  Jun 13, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include a gilded [[Avalokiteshvara]] image from 12th century, referred to as being resplendent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkativeman.com/gilt-bronze-statue-bodhisattva-avalokiteshvara/  Resplendent Sculpture of Avalokiteshvara from Kurkihar (Bihar, India) from 12th Century, January 10, 2017, Ellen Kaufman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery where the bronzes were found was named Apanakain in an [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]] manuscript now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

Major Kittoe in 1847, he visited the place twice and on the second visit to the village, spent four days collecting "ten cart-loads of images; all Buddhist and the Tamrika period". A great portion of this collection is preserved in the Indian Museum Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhpromo.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=71  KURKIHAR, -The remnants of an artistic age, 10 December 2009 20:10]&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham visited Kurkihar in 1861-62 and again in 1879-80. He mentions that the site was about 600 feet square and about 25 feet high. He mentioned having seen here not only numerous Buddhist images, large and small, but a large number of votive stupas. He says there were in his time "row after row of Chaityas extending north to south for several hundred feet".

In 1930 a hoard of 226 bronzes and five other objects was found at Kurkihar, which were unearthed from the main mound. These included  Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Stupas, Bells and ritual objects. Today, these objects are displayed in special room in the Patna Museum.

Of the 87 images, 81 were Buddhist and 6 Brahmanical. They were all found in one spot, with the smaller images enclosed in earthen jars.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Sarasvati and K.C. Sarkar, Kurkihar, Gaya and Bodh-Gaya, Rajshahi, 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; They were found about 25 feet below the surface of the main mound,  when someone was digging for bricks.

==Major images ==

The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha was sold for US$ 2,806,390 on 3 Oct 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24028/lot/16/  THE SONNERY KURKIHAR BUDDHA]&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly contemporaneous with the Atisha period in Tibet (1st half of the 11th century), which initiated a two-century period when Indian bronzes were collected by Tibetans and served as the models of  their own early styles. The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha may have been one such image that travelled to Tibet during the [[History_of_Tibet#Tibetan_Renaissance_.2810th-12th_century.29|Tibetan Renaissance]] period.

In 2005, for an exhibition in Australia, two of the three statues representing India were from Kurkihar, they were valued at US $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livehindustan.com/news/Gaya/article1-Kurkihar-neglected-Buddhist-site-lies-in-increased-prized-sculptures-653651.html  उपेक्षित है कुर्किहार बौद्ध स्थल, बढ़ में छिपी है बेशकीमती मूर्तियां, Live Hindustan, 4 जनवरी, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
Cunningham has written: "I procured several short but interesting inscriptions at Kurkihar. The name of Sakala is mentioned in several of them, and also Kerala in Dakshinades. The age of these inscriptions, judging from the shapes of the letters, must be about A.D. 800 to 1000"&lt;ref&gt;[https://silentpagesindia.blogspot.in/2013/09/visit-to-kurkihar-in-august-2013.html   An ancient legendary site yet to be fully explored and understood, 28th September 2013, Vikas Vaibhav]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ninety three inscriptions have been found on the bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji-Sastri, "Ninety-three Inscriptions on the Kurkihar Bronzes,  Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, XXVI, 3 (1940), 236-251. &lt;/ref&gt; The Kurkihar inscriptions refer to Devapala (810–c. 850), Rajyapala (908–940), Mahipala (988–c. 1036) and Vigrahapala III (1054–1072), ranging from 9th century to 1074 AD.  The name of the monastery was apparently named Apanaka, which is mentioned in several inscriptions. The monastery was apparently very popular among the visitors from [[Kanchi]] in South India.

The names, places of origin and ranks of the donors for 9-12th century have been analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/download/100/120 The socieo-economic dimensions of dedicatory inscriptions, B.N. Prasad, JOBS.2074(7):116-152]&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution is 9th century:14, 10th: 21, 11th: 25, and 12th: 10.

==Manuscript==
A circa 1100-1125 manuscript of [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]  now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt; was copied in this monastery during the rule of [[Ramapala]].

==Significance==

Kurkihar was apparently a major pilgrimage center located midway between [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and [[Rajgriha]] and as well an artistic center of brass and stone sculpting. The inscriptions found  refer to donors not only from distant place in India like Sakala in Punjab, and Kerala, Conjeevaram or Kanchi in the south, but also from Bali Islands, Malaya as well as  other countries. The inscriptions  refer to a number of kings, mostly of the Pala dynasty.

==Comparison with Nalanda bronzes==
[[File:043 Buddha Teaching, Nalanda (9218609395).jpg|thumb|Buddha Teaching, [[Nalanda]] ]]

Kurkihar bronzes have been compared with the bronzes from nearby Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=nalanda+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZG8OgVa2md&amp;sig=v10TTanrXBuxy8Cs4mxUGYNck34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix87zom6bXAhXH4IMKHULFDUoQ6AEISTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=kurkihar&amp;f=false The Bronzes of Nalanda and Hindu-javanese Art, A.J. Bernet Kampers, Brill Archive, 1933, p. 19-64]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that Nalanda sculptors may have settled in Kurkihar&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xLA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=nalanda+kurkihar+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qmgax54DUI&amp;sig=de0NKi94XGa4OX_BGvrFAh_yzgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3rfWWsabXAhVi_4MKHZLEB1EQ6AEIRTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=nalanda%20kurkihar%20bronzes&amp;f=false The "Påala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture,Volume 10 of The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Susan L. Huntington, Brill Archive, 1984  p. 5-153]&lt;/ref&gt; Kurkihar bronzes data from 10th to 12th cent while Nalanda bronzes cover the period from 7th to 9th cent. nalanda bronzes are reddish whereas Kurkihar bronzes are more yellow.

==Museums==

Most of the Kurkihar bronzes are in the [[Patna Museum]]. The Hindu temple situated in the north-eastern portion of the village was visited by Cunningham in 1861 where a number of images, both Buddhist and Hindu images,  dated to the 10th - 11th Century AD, have been preserved here.

==Patna Museum theft==

On Sept 26, 2006, 18 bronze images from Kurkihar were stolen from the Patna Museum. The thieves entered through a window by cutting the cutting bars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/18-statues-figurines-of-pala-period-stolen-from-patna-museum/418634   18 statues, figurines of Pala period stolen from Patna museum, Outlook, Sept 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The images were later recovered from a gang  including a Vinod Yadav in Nalanda district, and Shahid Warsi of Kolkata. A [[Manjushri]] image was not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6038510.stm Priceless Indian statue recovered, BBC,  10 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many car chairs are adorned in leather or synthetic material designed for comfort or relief from the noted stress of being seated.

* [[Dentist chair]], a deeply reclining chair to allow the dentist easy access to the patient's mouth. The reclining position adjusts as well as the overall height of the chair.

The seat and back are made of canvas or a similar strong fabric which bears the user's full weight and can be folded; the frame is made of wood, or sometimes metal or plastic. The seat and scissors members work together to support and distribute the sitter's weight so that the seat is comfortably taut. The back is usually low and the chair usually has armrests. The stereotypical image of a movie director on location includes one of these chairs, hence the name. [[Victor Papanek]] describes this chair as an excellent design in his book ''Design for the Real World'' as it is simple and ideally suited to its function. The design goes back to coffer-makers' chairs of the 15th century and eventually to the Roman [[curule chair]].

* [[Ironing chair]], a lightly built folding chair usually with a metal frame and small padded seat and either a minimal padded back or a simple tubular loop back. The chair is usually used as a 'perch', a support for carrying out an activity - such as ironing - by people with disabilities or back problems, but they are also popular with anyone requiring a light supporting chair for extended periods, such as observing through a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chairs.faidahbir.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors''' is the oldest surviving women's art group in Australia.

==History==

The Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors (MSWPS) began in 1902 as a monthly gathering of eight former students of [[Frederick McCubbin]] from the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School|National Gallery School]] which members called the ''Students' Art Club''. It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, [[Henrietta Maria Gulliver]] and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906).&lt;ref name=peers/&gt; In 1905 they added the indigenous word  "Woomballano" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to ''The Women's Art Club'' in 1913 then to the ''Melbourne Society of Women Painters'' in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.&lt;ref name=peers&gt;{{Citation |author= Juliette Peers| title=More than just gumtrees: a personal, social and artistic history of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors |date=1993 | publisher=Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in association with Dawn Revival Press | isbn=978-0-646-16033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of its early members were [[plein air]] painters and identified with the [[Heidelberg School]], which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the [[decorative arts]] at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the [[Max Meldrum|Meldrum]] tonal school and [[modernism]], being invited to join. The Society was less overtly [[feminist]] than its counterpart ''[[The Sydney Society of Women Painters]]'' (later named ''[[Women’s Industrial Art Society]]'') which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Gaze, Delia | author2=Mihajlovic, Maja | author3=Shrimpton, Leanda | title=Dictionary of women artists | publication-date=1997 | publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn | isbn=978-1-884964-21-3 | page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Second World War]] the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors’ opened volunteer headquarters at [[Grosvenor Chambers]] (9 [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;{{Citation | author1=Taylor, Alex | author2=State Library of Victoria (Melbourne) | title=Perils of the studio : inside the artistic affairs of bohemian Melbourne | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Australian Scholarly Publishing | isbn=978-1-74097-149-2 | page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSWPS has met at heritage-listed [[Ola Cohn|Ola Cohn House]] 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964.

In [[visual arts]], [[Minimal music|music]], and other mediums, '''minimalism''' is an [[art movement]] that began in post–[[World War II]] Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minimalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

[[Minimalist music|Minimalism in music]] often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Julius Eastman]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. &lt;!--The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", "literalist art"&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "ABC Art"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan, as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 – June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the art movement called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of Kazimir Malevich, [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein had painted [[Monochrome painting|monochromes]] as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950—but his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] ''[[Yves: Peintures]]'' in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Weitemeier, ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: International Klein Blue'', Original-Ausgabe (Cologne: Taschen, 1994), 15. {{ISBN|3-8228-8950-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Paint Uncovered|chapter=Restoring the Immaterial: Study and Treatment of Yves Klein's ''Blue Monochrome (IKB42)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161–172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 [[Artforum]] essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1–3", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] – "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early "black paintings" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists—including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]—had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing—namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann’s reaction was—one of the questions he asked Jackson was, "Do you work from nature?" There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson’s answer was, "I am nature." And Hofmann’s reply was, "Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself." To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With regard to home design, more attractive "minimalistic" designs are not truly minimalistic because they are larger, and use more expensive building materials and finishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There are observers who describe the emergence of minimalism as a response to the brashness and chaos of urban life. In Japan, for example, minimalist architecture began to gain traction in the 1980s when its cities experienced rapid expansion and booming population. The design was considered an antidote to the "overpowering presence of traffic, advertising, jumbled building scales, and imposing roadways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fractal Dimension of Architecture|last=Ostwald|first=Michael|last2=Vaughan|first2=Josephine|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2016|isbn=9783319324241|location=Newcastle|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic environment was not only driven by urbanization, industrialization, and technology but also the Japanese experience of constantly having to demolish structures on account of the destruction wrought by World War II and the earthquakes, including the calamities it entails such as fire. The minimalist design philosophy did not arrive in Japan by way of another country as it was already part of the Japanese culture rooted on the Zen philosophy. There are those who specifically attribute the design movement to Japan's spirituality and view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of Minimalism|last=Cerver|first=Francisco|publisher=Arco|year=1997|isbn=9780823061495|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886–1969) adopted the motto "Less is more" to describe his aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philip Johnson]], op. cit.  A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer Dieter Rams' motto, "Less but better."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tactic was one of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity—he enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895–1983) adopted the engineer's goal of "Doing more with less", but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name="Rossell"&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details, and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name="Pawson"&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‘essences’ are light, form, detail of material, space, place, and human condition.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. They consider the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to  details, people, space, nature, and materials.,&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; believing this reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and aids the search for the essence of those invisible qualities—such as natural light, sky, earth, and air. In addition, they "open a dialogue" with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Rossell"/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements strive to convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"/&gt; In the late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement became popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‘truth to materials’ with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"/&gt;

[[Image:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;

The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities and essence of materials and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in [[Ryoanji]] temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese "MA" |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando’s works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995–96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein’s ideas of fashion. John Pawson’s interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to "choose sides" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term "minimalism" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main article|Minimal music}}

The term "minimal music" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1533">'''Miscellanea Historica Hibernica''', also known as MS G1, is a [[manuscript]] [[miscellany]], a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] [[vellum]] commonplace book. 

Compiled by [[Pilip Ballach Ó Duibhgeannáin]] during the years 1579 - 1584, it is described on the front endpaper as ''Miscellanea Historica Hibernica'' in a later hand. Ó Duibhgeannáin was a resident of Cloonybrien, [[County Roscommon]]. 

The ''Miscellanea'' contains an Irish rendering of an extract from a [[Latin]] tract found in [[Roger Bacon]]'s 13th century version of ''Secretum Secretorum'' on [[physiognomy]].

Irish priest and historian [[Paul Walsh (priest)|Paul Walsh]] suggested that Ó Duibhgeannáin was a son of Fer Caogad mac Ferghal Ó Duibhgeannáin, who died at Cloonybried in 1581.

'''motion''' is one of North America's leading innovative and uniquely intimate conference for creatives{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Influential creative pros in the motion picture and broadcast industries take the stage to share unique concepts and innovative ideas: 18-minute '''[[TED (conference)|TED]]''' talk style presentations designed to revitalize the creative muse and feed your creative brain.

'''motion''' was founded in 2006, as a one-off one-day regional event taking place in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] part of the United States. In 2007, the conference became an annual multi-day worldwide event, and is attended by creatives including [[Motion Graphic Design|motion designers]], [[Film producer producers|producers]], [[visual effects]] artists, writers, [[animator]]s, [[Film title design|motion picture title designers]], broadcast designers, [[creative director]]s, [[graphic designer]]s, and [[illustrator]]s.

June 2015, '''motion''' will be held at the [[Palace of the Governors|New Mexico History Museum Auditorium]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in conjunction with [[CURRENTS New Media]] festival.

==Background==

===Mission Statement===
&lt;blockquote&gt;To help creatives achieve their dreams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''motion''' staff of 2 people is headquartered in [[Albuquerque]].

===History===
'''motion''' was conceived by motion and graphic designers Elaine Montoya and Becky Padilla, who observed that many working professionals in the [[Film|motion picture]] and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] industries experience creative burnout largely due to the demands and long hours common in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will 60, 70, or 100 hour work weeks be common with a union contract?|url= http://vfx.iatse.com/faq.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition, Film and Video Editors and Camera Operators|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/film-and-video-editors-and-camera-operators.htm#tab-3|date = 8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''motion''' serves as an intimate "creative retreat" where professionals gather as a means to revitalize creativity.

'''motion''' was conceived by motion graphic designers Elaine Montoya and Becky Padilla, who observed that while there were numerous opportunities for working professionals in the [[Film|motion picture]] and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] industries to further their technical skills, there were no venues where experienced creative professionals could come together as a community to address common issues and be inspired.

In the early year, (2006-2009), '''motion''' was held at various hotels in [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico. From 2010-2013, '''motion''' was held at the historic [[KiMo Theatre]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], commencing on the first Friday of the [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta]]. In 2014, industry professionals cited difficulty in attending the conference because October is historically a busy time in the industry. Because of this, the dates for '''motion''' 2014 was changed to August.

Starting in 2015, '''motion''' will be held at the [[Palace of the Governors|New Mexico History Museum Auditorium]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] from June 12–15 in conjunction with CURRENTS International New Media Festival. CURRENTS consists of video and interactive installations, animation, art apps, full dome and multimedia performances. '''motion''' producers cited the opportunity to provide attendees with unique creative stimuli as the primary reason for this collaboration. Over 5000 visitors attended CURRENTS festival events in 2014.

Initially, the speakers came from the fields of motion picture and broadcast, but by 2012, the roster of presenters broadened to include creatives outside of the motion picture and broadcast industries including writers, musicians, artists, and many others.

==motion==
'''motion''' is an annual conference for creatives. Influential creative pros in the motion picture and broadcast industries take the stage to share unique concepts and innovative ideas: 18-minute '''[[TED Talk|TED]]''' talk style presentations designed to revitalize the creative muse and feed your creative brain.

In 2015, '''motion''' will be held at the [[Palace of the Governors|New Mexico History Museum Auditorium]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] from June 12–15 in conjunction with CURRENTS International New Media Festival.

Some of the highlights of the conference include '''FACEOFF: The After Effects Challenge''', where 3 motion design pros compete on stage in front of a live audience to create a 5-10 second motion graphic in just 60 minutes. Industry icons Trish and Chris Meyer along with motion emcee Elaine Montoya commentate the event. During '''FACEOFF''' industry related companies host booths, and provide training workshops.

'''motion''' speakers are some of the most creative thinkers and innovators today. A concept borrowed from [[TED Talk|TED]], each speaker is on stage for 18 minutes sharing their unique perspective on subjects they’re passionate about. Innovative ideas that revitalize the creative muse. Talks that ''feed the creative brain''. Past speakers include: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284580/ Karin Fong], Director at [http://www.imaginaryforces.com/ Imaginary Forces], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1364187/ Andrew Orloff] VFX Supervisor and Owner of [http://www.zoicstudios.com/ Zoic Studios], HUD Designer [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1268048/ Mark Coleran], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3075843/ Patrick Hanenberger], Production Designer at [http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/ Dreamworks Animation], and [[Dan Haskett]] a veteran animator who designed the character Belle for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]’s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', as well as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and Tod as an adult for ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.

'''''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue''''' is a poster by [[France|French]] artist [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. It is a colour [[lithograph]] from 1891, probably printed in about 3,000 copies, advertising the famous dancers [[La Goulue]] and [[Valentin le désossé|"No-Bones" Valentin]], and the new [[Paris]] dance hall [[Moulin Rouge]].&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most examples were pasted as advertising posters and lost, surviving examples are in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and many other institutions.

==Description==
''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue'' is a bold, four-color lithograph depicting the famous [[cancan]] dancer La Goulue and her flexible partner Valentine le désossé made to advertise the popular French club, Moulin Rouge. Their audience is reduced to silhouettes in order to focus attention on the performers and evoke the Japanese art then in vogue. The triple repetition of the club's name draws the focus down to the central figure of the poster, La Goulue herself.&lt;ref name="NGA"/&gt; The stark white of her petticoats, depicted with just a few lines on the white paper, epitomizes Toulouse-Lautrec's boldly simplistic style, a sharp break from the text-heavy posters of the day.&lt;ref name="IMA"/&gt;

==Historical information==
The Moulin Rouge had opened two years earlier, in 1889, and instantly established itself as a [[Montmartre]] landmark. It was renowned for the elasticity of its young dancers, both physically and morally; police officers made periodic checks to ensure that they were all wearing underwear. However, the poster by [[Jules Chéret]] advertising the club's delights, was relatively subdued, so the director [[Charles Zidler]] hired the young (only 27 years old) Toulouse-Lautrec to create a more vibrant poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toulouse-Lautrec PL. 122 Moulin Rouge - La Goulue|publisher=Yaneff International Gallery|url=http://www.yaneff.com/html/plates/pl122.html|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue'' was Toulouse-Lautrec's first attempt at lithography, such was his grasp of the medium's possibilities that it was an immediate sensation. 3000 copies spread around Paris captivated the public with their eye-catching design, bold colors, and innovative, Japanese-inspired use of silhouettes. Cannily focusing on the dancer La Goulue, whose energetic kicks and insatiable appetites had made her famous, gave the poster an additional boost in popularity. However, it was Toulouse-Lautrec's own artistic skill that made him a star overnight.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matheny|first=Lynn Kellmanson|title=Cafés, Cabarets, and Dance Halls|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|year=2005|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2005/toulouse/cafes.shtm|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muslimgauze''' was the main musical project of '''Bryn Jones''' (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British [[ethnic electronica]] and [[experimental music]]ian who was influenced by conflicts and history in the [[Muslim world]], often with an emphasis on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never made mainstream success due to his work being issued mostly in limited editions on small record labels and being deeply experimental in style. His music has been described by one critic as "among the most startling and unique in the [[noise music|noise]] underground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/muslimgauze-mn0000620392/biography|title=Muslimgauze - Biography - AllMusic|author=John Bush|work=AllMusic|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early musical career===
Jones first released music in 1982 as {{Sic|hide=y|E.g Oblique Graph}} on Kinematograph, his own imprint, and the independent co-op label Recloose, run by Simon Crab. {{Sic|hide=y|E.g Oblique Graph}} came from the do-it-yourself ([[DIY]]) ethos of the time and was musically composed of electronic/experimental drone with occasional synth-melodic hooks and use of radio broadcast samples.

Releases at the time were occasionally on cassette, more often vinyl EPs and LPs; the longest running of Jones' label monikers, Limited Editions, started with ''Hunting Out with an Aerial Eye'' (1984) followed by ''Buddhist on Fire'', put out by Recloose the same year. Since then, Jones roughly released an album a year, given scarce financial resources until 1988, when he began making inroads with then-emerging labels [[Staalplaat]], [[Soleilmoon]], and [[Extreme Records]].

By the late 1980s, Jones ran out of funding to self-release, and other labels that did put out Muslimgauze releases such as Recloose and Permis De Construire (which put out ''[[Coup d'Etat (Muslimgauze album)|Coup d'Etat]]'') did not pay promised royalties. Recloose head Simon Crab cited lack of sales and damaged records from fire bombing as his reason.

{{quote|The neighbouring Thomas a Becket pub run by East End gangsters—common-or-garden low-level vicious thugs (years before the species was romanticized by Lock Stock and Mona Lisa)—unable to control our unlicensed trade in alcohol and other illicits, firebombed the building one night and attacked the crew on a regular basis (Many of the new pressings of Muslimgauze's ''Buddhist on Fire'' stored in the Recloose offices were destroyed during this attack).|''Stalker'' blog post&lt;ref name="Stalker"&gt;{{cite web |title="Live Series 2" &amp; the London Ambulance Station |url=http://crab.wordpress.com/2008/11/28/live-series-2-the-london-ambulance-station/ |author = Gehr |first = Richard |date =28 November 2008 |work=Stalker |publisher=Simon Crab}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The deal with [[Recloose]] was that we paid 50 percent of the profits to the artist and 50 percent went to the label, which was a pretty good deal, especially since we didn't sell that much. We put a lot of energy into marketing, and most of the artists signed to the label sold off the back of [[Bourbonese Qualk]] anyway. He assumed we sold loads of albums but we didn't even cover the costs.|Simon Crab&lt;ref name="ei"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Khider |first = Ibrahim |authorlink =  |date=Spring–Summer 2006 |title = Equations of Eternity |journal = [[e/i]] |volume = |issue = |pages = 54–60 |url =  |type = print |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At this time, distributors Soleilmoon, Staalplaat, and Extreme Records transitioned to becoming labels with the advent of the compact disc format, which became less expensive to produce and ship than vinyl over time and gradually became a physical staple of the Muslimgauze catalogue.

===Later musical career===

It was with the release of ''[[United States of Islam]]'' (1991) a formalised agreement was reached with Extreme Records, which helped fund professional studio recordings, designed attractive packaging, and used a more extensive distribution network. Though pleased at first, Jones was frustrated with Extreme's one-release-a-year policy and in 1993 signed with then-sibling labels Soleilmoon and Staalplaat, which offered a more frequent release schedule. 1993 saw the release of ''Vote Hezbollah'', ''Veiled Sisters'' and a re-release of ''Iran'' on Soleilmoon and ''[[Hamas Arc]]'', ''Satyajit Eye'' and ''Betrayal'' on Staalplaat.&lt;ref name="ei" /&gt; His 1998 record ''[[Mullah Said]]'' on the label has been critically acclaimed.

Jones additionally released material on nearly any small label that approached him. A drawback with releasing on so many labels was gratuitous editing by producers and, through design or circumstance, no royalties. Extreme cited betrayal by distribution networks that were unscrupulous or filed for bankruptcy and could not pay—though they also claimed to have eventually remunerated Jones. Lack of due royalties was a source of ongoing stress throughout Jones's career.

He once stated that he never had time to listen to other people's music, although in a 1992 interview with ''Impulse Magazine'', he mentioned that he enjoyed traditional music of Japan, the Middle East, and [[India]], as well as the works of artists such as [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], and [[Faust (band)|Faust]].&lt;ref name="Impulse" /&gt;

===Death===
On 30 December 1998, Jones was rushed to [[Emergency department|A&amp;E]] in Manchester with a rare fungal infection in his bloodstream, for which he had to be heavily sedated. His body eventually shut down, and he died on 14 January 1999.&lt;ref name= "NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = Bryan Jones, 38, Musician Known as Muslimgauze | work = The New York Times | date= 28 January 1999 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/28/arts/bryn-jones-38-musician-known-as-muslimgauze.html | accessdate = 16 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Reprinted at http://elvispelvis.com/Brynjones.htm#obit --&gt;

==Legacy==
Since Bryn Jones's death in 1999 at the age of 37, his music under Muslimgauze has continued to be released. He often inundated labels and collaborators with music, and consequently the latter had to be selective of what was eventually put out. Labels, including Soleilmoon and Staalplaat, continue to publish unreleased albums, as well as releases of demos, his own reworked tracks, and abandoned full-length tapes. Jones' posthumous discography is known for including many studio variations of nearly all his music.&lt;ref name="PerfSound" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialObit"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kinney |first = Rick |year = 2004 |title = Industrial Nation interview |journal = Industrial Nation |issue = 20 |url = http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/industrial-nation2(article).html |type = print |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227084830/http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/industrial-nation2(article).html |archivedate = 27 February 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unreleased"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powne|first=Charles|title=Unreleased Muslimgauze Albums|url=http://arabbox.free.fr/unreleased.html|date=1999|website=Arabbox|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Vinyl On Demand]] released ''Chasing the Shadow of Bryn Jones 1983–1988'', a 10&amp;nbsp;LP [[box set]] reissueing early albums originally released by Product Kinematopgraph, Recloose Organisation, and Jones' own Limited Editions. Each LP includes bonus tracks taken from period [[compilation album]]s. The release was also accompanied by [[biography]] written by Ibrahim Khider titled ''Muslimgauze: Chasing the Shadow of Bryn Jones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslimgauze 10-LP boxset on the way from Vinyl-On-Demand|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/01/17/muslimgauze-10-lp-boxset-on-the-way-from-vinyl-on-demand/|date=17 January 2014|website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|FACT]]|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical styles==
Muslimgauze's music is often difficult to describe due to sheer volume, content diversity and often singular stylings; Jones never produced any hit albums or songs. However, it's possible to describe common features of his music as he tended to use many of the same strategies, modified from album to album to give each release a distinct feel or concept.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; The music often is heavily electronic and strongly rhythmic (sometimes including live studio percussion), though tempos can vary from very fast to slowly driving and almost ambient, making frequent use of gradually-changing structures or melodic motifs. Critic Ned Raggett of reviewed a number of Muslimgauze albums for Allmusic.com, noting the diverse styles of Jones's recordings: ''United States of Islam'' (1991) featured layered percussion and "a muted [[techno]] pulse",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/united-states-of-islam-mw0000618670&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hamas Arc]]'' (1993) touched on a menacing "ambience that is not so far removed from the likes of [industrial metal acts] [[Godflesh]] or [[Scorn (band)|Scorn]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/hamas-arc-mw0000559890&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gun Aramaic]]'' (1996) blended atmospheric sounds and vocal samples that "almost turns the album into a soundtrack for a non-existent film."&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web | first = Ned| last = Raggett | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=gun-aramaic-r261522/review|pure_url=yes}} | title = Gun Aramaic review | publisher = AllMusic | accessdate = 2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event inspired Jones to research the conflict's origins, which grew into a lifelong artistic focal point, and he became a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause,&lt;ref name="IndustrialNation"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Rena |date = Summer 1994 |title = Industrial Nation interview |journal = Industrial Nation |volume =  |issue = 9 |pages =  |url = http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/industrial-nation(article).html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080215115729/http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/industrial-nation(article).html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2008-02-15 |type = print |quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and often dedicated recordings to the Palestinian Liberation Organization or a free [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gehr
Village Voice (28 October 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Jones's research further grew to encompass other conflict-ridden, predominantly Muslim countries including [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Chechnya]], Iran, and Iraq. He concluded that Western interests for natural resources and strategic-political gain were root causes for many of these conflicts and should Western meddling halt, said regions would stabilise.&lt;ref name="NetworkNews" /&gt;

Jones frequently netted criticism for never having visited the [[Middle East]]. He said in a 1994 interview, "I don't think you can visit an occupied land. It's the principle. Not until it's free again."&lt;ref name="VVoice"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gehr |first = Richard |date = 28 October 1994 |title = Beyond the Veil |journal = [[Village Voice]] |volume =  |issue =  |pages =  |url = http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/veil(article).html |type = print |quote =  |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227083109/http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/veil(article).html |archivedate = 27 February 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

References in dedications, album, and track titles suggest Jones had researched the conflict regions in the Middle East, as well as [[Chechnya]], Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and [[Indonesia]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gehr, Village Voice (28 October 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Musical references also extended to other creeds and ethnicities including Hindus, Tibetan Buddhists, and Sri-Lankans.&lt;ref name="PerfSound"&gt;{{cite web |title=Muslimgauze |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/muslimgauze.html |last = Khider |first = Ibrahim |date=March 2005 |work= |publisher=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked what he would do if conflicts in the Muslim world were peaceably resolved, Jones replied his music would champion other conflict regions such as China's occupation of [[Tibet]].

==Discography==
{{main|Bryn Jones discography}}

He released over 90 original albums on 32 different record labels, creating nearly 2,000 original compositions. Many of his pieces were inspired by political facts or events. Many of his releases have been re-pressed as, after 1994, most of his albums were released in limited editions of 200–1,000.

==Live performances==
During the early phase of his career, Jones was known to have performed only one live show in 1986 at the V2 in s-Hertogenbosch, the [[Netherlands]]. At the behest of Bourbonese Qualk, of the Recloose label, Jones performed a half-hour set. The show consisted of Jones singing to a backing track while Simon Crab then members of [[Bourbonese Qualk]] added instrumental accompaniment. By all accounts the show went reasonably, but Jones was traumatised by the experience enough to swear off live performance until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ei" /&gt;

Jones resumed live performance in 1995 at the behest of record store owner and DJ Simon Scott. Part of Jones's apprehension with live performance was in trying to figure out how to present the music. He concluded the best way was refrain from vocals with lyrics and instead play live percussion atop a backing track. He also did DJ sets that consisted of exclusively his own material. Contrary to his 1986 experience, Jones did enjoy doing live shows and frequently did them in his last years in diverse places such as the UK, throughout mainland Europe, and even Japan.&lt;ref name="AmbiEntrance"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rama |first=Link |date=7 March 1998 |title=Muslimgauze: Bryn Jones Interview |journal=AmbiEntrance |volume=  |issue=20 |pages=  |url=http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/ambientrance%28article%29.html |quote=  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831131806/http://www.muslimgauze.org/articles/ambientrance%28article%29.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="almassalives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslimgauze live dates|url=http://arabbox.free.fr/almassalives.htmlus|website=Arabbox|accessdate=15 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">'''Parodos'''  (also '''parode''' and '''parodus'''; {{lang-grc|πάροδος}}, "entrance," plural ''parodoi''), in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theater of ancient Greece]], is either a side-entrance, or the first song sung by the chorus after its entrance from the side wings.

==Side-entrance to the theater==
The parodos is an entrance affording access either to the stage (for actors) or to the [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|orchestra]] (for the chorus) of the ancient Greek theater. The parodoi are distinguished from the entrances to the stage from the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]'', or stage building. The two parodoi are located on either side of the stage, between it and the ''[[Theatre of ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|theatron]]'', or audience seating area. The term [[eisodos]] is also used.

==Entrance song of the chorus==
A "parodos" is also the ode sung by the chorus as it enters the orchestra. Usually the first choral song of the drama, the parodos typically follows the play's [[prologue]]. 

==In trench warfare==
{{main|Trench warfare}}
In [[Trench warfare#Trench construction|trench construction]] the parados is the banked earth on the rear lip of the trench which protects a soldier's back from shells falling behind the trench.

The '''representation of women in Athenian tragedy''' was performed exclusively by men and it is likely (although the evidence is not conclusive) that it was performed solely for men as well.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[The arts|art-forms]] constitutes a [[paradox]]. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female [[Character (arts)|characters]]: [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]''. Female [[Greek chorus|tragic choruses]] also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.&lt;ref name="Easterling"&gt;Easterling, P. E. (Ed.). (1997). ''Cambridge companion to Greek tragedy.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural stereotype== 
Macaria, in the ''[[Heracleidae]]'' states that "for a woman, silence and self control are best."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; The philosopher [[Xenophon]] thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion.&lt;ref name="Bushnell"&gt;Bushnell, R. W. (Ed.). (2005). ''A companion to tragedy.'' Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D14&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into "the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; [[Sheila Murnaghan]] argues that "it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility, on long term loan by her father.&lt;ref name="Blondell"&gt;Blondell, R., et al. (Ed.). (1999). ''Women on the edge: four plays by Euripides.'' New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; 
The playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist [[Alcestis]], represents the "perfect wife" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet as Blondell points out this "female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic" as her own marriage kills her.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

The most important relationships within this play are between the men. [[Heracles]] goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. [[Admetos]] goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. "Alcestis drops out," Easterling argues, "to facilitate the interaction between the men."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt;

In contrast, however, Euripides [[Medea]] breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. "In a sense," Blondell argues, "every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband."&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

==Theatrical themes==

===The problem of male absence===
In the surviving plays, women become [[Tragedy|tragic]] figures by men’s absence or mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

[[Sophocles]]' [[Antigone]] takes action after her uncle [[Creon]] refuses to bury her brother [[Polynices]]. In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] takes power in [[Argos]] because her husband [[Agamemnon]] has been away fighting at [[Troy]] for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband [[Jason]] plans a new more advantageous marriage.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The public versus the private===
There is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was [[Setting (narrative)|set]] outside the private sphere of the home.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; Indeed, [[Euripides]] was notorious for "taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy" and thereby reducing its remoteness.&lt;ref name="McLeish"&gt;McLeish, K., et al. (Trans.). (2005). ''Greek tragedy.'' London: Nick Hern.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son [[Orestes]] forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. "This three play sequence," Bushnell argues, "which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.'&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The female warrior===
A woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. [[Euripides]]' [[Medea]] is the prime example. Her name in Greek means "cunning" and is also the word for the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy).&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

Most of the time, a woman is full of fear&lt;br&gt;
Too weak to defend herself or to bear the sight of steel &lt;br&gt;
But if she happens to be wronged in love,&lt;br&gt;
Hers is the bloodthirstiest heart of all.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

Ruby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as [[Patroclus]] famously does to [[Homer]]’s [[Achilles]] in the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]''.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet Medea, similarly to [[Aeschylus]]’ [[Clytemnestra]], another "woman with a heart of manly counsel"&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; were not admired  but portrayed as "[[Cruella de Vil]]" type characters.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

So the declaration "that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour" does not apply to women.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

==Public reaction==
In [[Plato]]’s [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], [[Socrates]] thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried "about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt; Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal [[Polis|city-state]].&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

The [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] however thought it important to place on "display those feature[s] of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice."&lt;ref name="Bushnell"/&gt;

[[File:Roosterhawaii.jpg|thumb|Wild rooster on the Hawaiian island of Kauai]]
A '''rooster''', also known as a '''cockerel''' or '''cock''', is an adult male [[Galliformes|gallinaceous]] bird, usually an adult male [[chicken]] (''Gallus gallus domesticus'').

Mature male chickens less than one year old are called cockerels. The term "rooster" originates in the United States,&lt;ref name="Rawson"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/why-do-we-say-17 Hugh Rawson] "Why Do We Say...? Rooster", ''American Heritage'', Aug./Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is widely used throughout North America, as well as Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The older terms "cock" or "cockerel", the latter denoting a young cock, are used in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poultry.ie/2009/08/03/dorking-the-five-toed-chicken/ poultry.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501180347/http://poultry.ie/2009/08/03/dorking-the-five-toed-chicken/ |date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at day, which is done by both sexes. The rooster is [[polygamy|polygamous]], but cannot guard several nests of eggs at once. He guards the general area where his hens are [[bird nest|nest]]ing, and attacks other roosters that enter his territory. During the daytime, a rooster often sits on a high perch, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1|abbr=in|order=flip}} off the ground, to serve as a lookout for his group (hence the term "rooster"). He sounds a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby and will frequently crow to assert his territory.

==Crowing==
[[File:Hanenkraaiwedstrijd.jpg|thumb|A young [[Bergische Kräher|Berg crower]] at a crowing contest]]
[[File:KrährufBergischerKräher.ogg|thumb|The long crowing of a [[Bergische Kräher|Berg crower]]]]
[[File:Rooster crowing small.ogv|thumb|Normal length crowing (with audio)]]
[[File:Cocks Fighting.jpg|thumb|Two cocks fighting]]
[[File:Fighting cock Philippines.jpg|thumb|right|A rooster from the [[Philippines]] crowing. Note the characteristic neck bending that always takes place during crowing.]]
Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Read|first=Gina|title=Sexing Chickens|url=http://successwithpoultry.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/sexing-chickens.html|work=Keeping Chickens Newsletter|publisher=keepingchickensnewsletter.com|accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rooster is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn ("cock-a-doodle-doo"). However, while many roosters crow shortly after waking up, this idea is not exactly true. A rooster can and will crow at any time of the day. Some roosters are especially vociferous, crowing almost constantly, while others only crow a few times a day. These differences are dependent both upon the rooster's breed and individual personality. A rooster can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory.

Roosters have several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. Roosters occasionally make a patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks.

===Rooster crowing contests===
Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blsde_20110627_002 Cock crowing contest recognised as National Heritage in Belgium] Stefaan De Groote, ''Het Nieuwsblad'', 27. June 2011 (in Dutch). Accessed October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the United States, [[Indonesia]] and Japan. The oldest contests are held with [[Long-crowing chicken|longcrowers]]. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.

==Capons==
{{Main|Capon}}
A capon is a castrated rooster. In the caponization procedure, the bird's [[testis|testes]] are completely removed; a surgical procedure is required for this as the rooster's sexual organs are internal. As a result of this procedure, certain male physical characteristics will experience stunted development:
*The comb and wattles cease growing after castration, giving a capon's head a dwarfed appearance.
*The hackle, tail and saddle [[feather]]s grow unusually long.

Caponization also affects the disposition of the bird. Removal of the bird's testes eliminates the male sex [[hormone]]s, lessening the male sex instincts and changing their behaviour: the birds become more docile, less active, and tend not to fight.

This procedure produces a unique type of poultry meat which is favoured by a specialized market. The meat of normal uncastrated roosters has a tendency to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the uncastrated males. Overall, it is often thought that capon meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than regular chicken.

==Cockfighting==
{{Main|Cockfight}}
[[File:Cockfighter.jpg|thumb|A fighting cock for sale]]
A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two [[gamecock]]s or cocks, with the first use of the word gamecock (denoting use of the cock in game, sport, pastime or entertainment) appearing in 1646.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamecock gamecock - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary] – first use of word – 1646&lt;/ref&gt; after the term "cock of the game" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the secular sport of [[cockfight]]ing in ''The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting'' in 1607. Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially [[bred]] and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and [[wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called [[Dubbing (poultry)|dubbing]]. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning. Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of [[animal cruelty]] by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |title=Should cockfighting be outlawed in Oklahoma? |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=17 August 2009 |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619150618/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the surviving or last-bird-standing being declared the winner. There are religious significance and aspects of the rooster and the [[cockfight]] which are exampled by the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious and spiritual cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in the [[Balinese Hinduism]] spiritual appeasement exercise of Tabuh Rah, a form of [[animal sacrifice]], where [[ritual]] fights usually take place outside the [[temple]] and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[Indonesia Handbook, 3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, &amp; Jane Bickersteth], (Footprint – Travel Guides) 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly within the religious schema of Christianity and the cockfight within a religious, spiritual and sacred context, there are numerous representations of the rooster or the cock and the cockfight as a religious vessel found in the [[Catacombs]] from the earliest period&lt;ref name="Rev. John McClintock page 6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyclopaedia of biblical, theological and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 12|author=Rev. John McClintock|author2=James Strong|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1891|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as similar illustrations of cocks in fighting stance&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Symbols and Emblems of Early and Mediaeval Christian Art |author=Louisa Twining|page=188|year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the [[Vivian Bible]].

==The cockerel "waltz"==
[[File:Replica Statue of a Cock.JPG|thumb|Statue of a Rooster Cock at a park in South India]]
The cockerel "waltz", when the cockerel struts in a half circle with one wing extended down, is an aggressive approach signifying to females his dominance, and usually, the female will submit by running or moving away from the cockerel in acknowledgement. On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the cockerel for dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. Note also that the cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back.

Some more aggressive cockerels will drop and extend both wings and puff out all their body feathers to give the hens or other cocks the impression of a larger size, and charge through the hen yard.

==Religion and spiritual belief systems==
[[File:Un coq.JPG|thumb|Rooster]]
Since antiquity the rooster has been, and still is, a sacred animal in some cultures&lt;ref name="AdlerLawler"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Jerry Adler |author2=Andrew Lawler |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist= |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deeply embedded within various religious belief systems and [[religious worship]]. The term "Persian bird" for the cock would appear to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact "because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peters |first=John P. |date=1913 |title=The Cock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGUPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=33 |page=381 |jstor=592841}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even long before that time, in [[Iran]], during the Kianian Period, from about 2000&amp;nbsp;BC to about 700&amp;nbsp;BC, "the cock was the most sacred"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Zoroastrian Civilization – From the Earliest Times to the Downfall of the last Zoroastrian Empire 651 A.D.|author=Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animism, shamanism and tribal religions===
In [[Southeast Asia]], understandings and interpretations of indigenous beliefs of the veneration of spirits and deities remain strong and for many who are practicing Christians there is still the veneration of the traditional spirits ([[anito]]) as in northern Philippines.

===Norse mythology===
In [[Norse mythology]], the crowing of three particular roosters occur at the beginning of the foretold events of [[Ragnarök]]. In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', references to Ragnarök begin from stanza 40 until 58, with the rest of the poem describing the aftermath. In the poem, a ''[[völva]]''—a Nore seeress—recites information to the wisdom-seeking god [[Odin]]. In stanza 41, the völva says:
{|

&lt;small&gt;Old Norse:&lt;/small&gt;
:Fylliz fiǫrvi
:feigra manna,
:rýðr ragna siǫt

:Svǫrt verða sólskin

The völva then describes three roosters crowing: In stanza 42, the [[jötunn]] [[herder|herdsman]] [[Eggthér]] sits on a [[tumulus|mound]] and cheerfully plays his [[harp]] while the crimson rooster [[Fjalar (disambiguation)|Fjalar]] ([[Old Norse]] "hider, deceiver"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD-43"&gt;Orchard, Andy (1997).

===Samaritanism===
{{main|Samaritans}}
The Samaritans or 'Cutheans' are an ethnic group with a long history, once widely distributed and powerful. From Assyria they extended to India, China, Arabia Petraea and Abyssinia. They were also introduced by the Assyrian Empire into Samaria, in a policy of mass deportations. They had their Samaritan Temple on [[Mount Gerizim]], opposite the Temple in Jerusalem, and they worshipped the Mesopotamian deity [[Nergal]]: his emblem was a ''cock'' (rooster).&lt;ref&gt;([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]], 17:30). "According to the rabbis, his emblem was a cock".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/2_kings/17.htm Clarke's Commentary on the Bible - 2 Kings 17:30]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zohar]] (iii. 22b, 23a, 49b), the book of [[Jewish]] [[mysticism]] and collection of writings on the [[Torah]] written by first century tannaic sage [[Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai]] (Rashbi), tells of a celestial manifestation, which causes the crowing of the roosters; known also in the [[Talmud]], is "blessed be He who has given the cock intelligence", (Ber. 60b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=BARUCH, APOCALYPSE OF (Greek) |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2563-baruch-apocalypse-of-greek|first= |last= |volume= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as well as Job 38:36 in the [[Douay-Rheims]] Bible. Not only "In the rabbinic literature, the cockcrow is used as general marking of time",&lt;ref&gt; The Chronology of the Crucifixion – A Comparison of the Gospel Accounts – Tim Hegg TorahResource – 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but also some of the Sages interpreted the "cockcrow" to mean the voice of the Temple officer who summoned all priests, [[Levites]], and [[Israelites]] to their duties and used as such because the Hebrew gever was used also to mean a "rooster" in addition to the meaning of "man, strong man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chronology of the Crucifixion – A comparison of the Gospel Accounts|author=Tim Hegg|publisher=TorahResource|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] likewise provides the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks"&lt;ref&gt; A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron – 1985&lt;/ref&gt; – (Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b), which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins"([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" within the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31. Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of "a cock girded about the loins" within [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31([[Douay–Rheims Bible]]) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",&lt;ref&gt;PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18 – Michael V. Fox – Yale University Press 2009 – 704 pages&lt;/ref&gt; identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema of purpose and use, within Judeo-Christian traditions. The Hebrew term zarzir, which literally means "girt"; "that which is girt in the loins" (BDB 267 s.v.) is recognized in the Targum as well as the Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, LXX and Vulgate with all referencing the fighting rooster or fighting cock as the religious vessel. The ancient Hebrew versions identified the Hebrew "a girt one of the loins" of Proverbs 30:31 as a rooster, "which most of the old translations and Rabbis understood to be a fighting cock",&lt;ref&gt; Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament HALOT 1:281 s.v. zarzir&lt;/ref&gt; with also the Arabic sarsar or sirsir being an onomatopoeticon or onomatopoeia for rooster (alektor) as the Hebrew zarzir of Proverbs 30:31.

In the Jewish religious practice of [[Kapparos]], a rooster as a religious vessel is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the [[Day of Atonement]]. The meat is the distributed among the poor for their pre-fast meal. The purpose of the ritual is the expiation of sins of the man as the animal symbolically receives all the man's sins, which is based on the reconciliation of Isaiah 1:18. The religious practice is mentioned for the first time by [[Natronai ben Hilai]], Gaon of the Academy of Sura in [[Babylonia]], in 853 C.E., who describes it as a custom of the Babylonian Jews and further explained by Jewish scholars in the ninth century by that since the [[Hebrew]] word geber (Gever)&lt;ref&gt; Complete Jewish Bible by David H. Stern -1998&lt;/ref&gt; means both "man" and "rooster" the rooster may act or serve as a palpable substitute as a religious vessel in place of the man with the practice also having been as a custom of the Persian Jews.

The [[cornerstone]] is the first stone set in the construction of a masonry foundation and over time it became a [[ceremony|ceremonial]] stone with the laying of the stone being generally important metaphorically in [[sacred architecture]]. Frazer (2006: p.&amp;nbsp;106) in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' tells us that, "In modern Greece, when the foundation of a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone".

===Islam===
The understanding of the divine spiritual endowment of the rooster within [[Islam]], may be evidenced in the words of [[Muhammad]] of that [[Abrahamic religion]] in one of the six canonical hadith collections of [[Sunni Islam]], stating that of "when you hear the crowing of cocks, ask for Allah's Blessings for they have seen an angel".&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 54, Number 522&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shintoism===
Many roosters are found around [[Shinto shrines]], with the rooster being associated with the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ise Shrine (Ise Jingu), Ise – Sacred-destinations an ecumenical guide "[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/japan/ise-shrine ]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
In [[Taoism]], Hanshi and the spring [[Hanshi]] festival were when fires were not used and then relit. Since fire, like the cock a yang symbol and symbol of the sun, was temporarily extinguished and then relit. In a Tao religious aspect, to have a rooster fight another rooster, was the same in substance as a fire-renewal custom, where the rooster and the cockfight then takes its place as an indispensable spring ritual, and "Taoism, which assessed it positively in this form, can be thought to have guaranteed its continued existence".&lt;ref&gt; A Brush with the Spur: Robert Joe Cutter on the Chinese Cockfight, (review-article of The Brush and the Spur: Chinese Culture and the Cockfight), in Journal of the American Oriental Society, 113.3 (1993), pp. 444-49"[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/afs/pdf/a872.pdf]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanshi festival was eventually moved to coincide with the [[Qingming Festival]] or the [[Pure Brightness Festival]] which still includes the rooster and cockfight.&lt;ref&gt; Qingming Riverside Landscape Garden – Cultural-China.com, Shanghai, People's Republic of China "{{cite web |url=http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/Scenery88bye362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812045704/http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/Scenery88bye362.html |archivedate=12 August 2015 |df=dmy-all}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rachmaninoff 1906.jpg|thumb|Sergei Rachmaninoff in 1906]]
'''Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27''' is a [[symphony]] by the Russian composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], written in 1906–07. The premiere was conducted by the composer himself in [[Saint Petersburg]] on 8&amp;nbsp;February 1908.  Its duration is approximately 60 minutes when performed uncut; cut performances can be as short as 35 minutes. The score is dedicated to [[Sergei Taneyev]], a Russian composer, teacher, theorist, author, and pupil of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. Alongside his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]], this symphony remains one of the composer's best known compositions.

==History==

At the time his Symphony No. 2 was composed, Rachmaninoff had had two successful seasons as the [[conducting|conductor]] of the Imperial Opera at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in [[Moscow]]. He considered himself first and foremost a [[composer]] and felt that the performance schedule was detracting from his time to compose. 

[[File:Ivanovka front.jpg|thumb|left|Ivanovka]]
He then moved his wife and infant daughter to [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], to spend more time composing and to also escape the political tumult that would put Russia on the path to revolution. The family remained in Dresden for three years, spending summers at Rachmaninoff's in-law's estate of [[Ivanovka estate|Ivanovka]]. It was during this time that Rachmaninoff wrote not only his Second Symphony, but also the tone poem [[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|''Isle of the Dead'']].

Rachmaninoff was not altogether convinced that he was a gifted symphonist. At its 1897 premiere, his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 1]] (conducted by [[Alexander Glazunov]]) was considered an utter disaster; criticism of it was so harsh that it sent the young composer into a bout of [[clinical depression|depression]]. Even after the success of his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] (which won the [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka Award]] and 500 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] in 1904),&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Rachmaninoff still lacked confidence in his writing. He was very unhappy with the first draft of his Second Symphony but after months of revision he finished the work and conducted the premiere in 1908 to great applause.  The work earned him another Glinka Award ten months later. The triumph restored Rachmaninoff's sense of self-worth as a symphonist.

Because of its formidable length, Symphony No. 2 has been the subject of many revisions, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, which reduced the piece from nearly an hour to as little as 35 minutes. Before 1970 the piece was usually performed in one of its revised, shorter, versions. Since then orchestras have used the complete version almost exclusively, although sometimes with the omission of a repeat in the first movement. The 2016 [[André Previn|Previn]] / [[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]] CD is one of the abridged versions still available (9026-60791-2).

==Music==

===Scoring===
The symphony is scored for full [[orchestra]] with 3 [[flute]]s (the 3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 3 [[oboe]]s (the 3rd doubling on [[cor anglais]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s in A and B{{music|flat}}, [[bass clarinet]] in A and B{{music|flat}}, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[glockenspiel]], and [[stringed instruments|strings]].

===Movements===
The symphony is in four movements:
#Largo&amp;nbsp;— Allegro moderato ([[E minor]])
#Allegro molto ([[A minor]])
#Adagio ([[A major]])
#Allegro vivace ([[E major]])

====First movement====
The first movement begins with a slow introduction, in which the 'motto' theme of the symphony is introduced and developed. This leads to an impassioned climax, after which a [[cor anglais]] solo leads the movement into the allegro in [[sonata form]]. Assuming the symphony is performed uncut, this also includes a full repeat of the exposition. In contrast to the exposition, the development is stormy at times and moves through multiple key centres. Only the first subject and central motto theme are used in the development. After a long dominant pedal, the music slowly transitions to the recapitulation in E major, in which only the second subject is recapitulated, but is heavily expanded on compared to the exposition. This device of omitting the first subject from the recapitulation was also used by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Tchaikovsky)|second]], [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|fourth]] and [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|sixth]] symphonies. 
A coda in E minor concludes the movement ''fortissimo''.

|The second movement is a quick [[scherzo]] played ''Allegro molto''.
|}
This movement really only ''resembles'' a [[scherzo]] insofar as it relates to the early- to mid-Romantic tradition of symphonic movements, and its use of a typical scherzo form ([[rondo|ABACABA]]). The movement, in A minor, opens with a lively [[ostinato]] in the upper strings. As a fixture in large-scale works by Rachmaninoff, the [[Dies Irae]] [[plainchant]] is referenced, here in the opening bars by the horns. The B section is a lyrical ''[[cantabile]]'' melody in C major. The central trio section notably begins with a sudden, ''tutti'', ''fortissimo'' chord, and is an example of Rachmaninoff's mastery of counterpoint and fugal writing, thanks to his studies with Taneyev, to whom this symphony is dedicated. At the conclusion of the movement, the Dies Irae is again stated, this time by a brass choir. The movement ends ''pianississimo'' (''ppp'').

====Third movement====
This movement is in a broad three-part form, and is often remembered for its opening theme, which is played by the first violins and restated both as a melody and as an accompanying figure later on in the movement. This opening theme, however, is really an introduction to the main melody of the movement, which is presented by a lengthy [[clarinet]] solo, and is a typical Rachmaninoff creation, circling around single notes and accompanied by rich harmony. The second part of the movement is based on the initial motto theme of the symphony, and in many ways is a direct complement to the introduction of the first movement, leading to an impassioned climax in C major. After a transition back to the opening theme, the central melody of the movement is restated, this time played by the first violins, while fragments of the opening theme are heard in the accompaniment. The movement concludes in a tranquil fashion, dying away slowly in the strings.

|The beginning of the ''Allegro vivace'' finale.
|}

====Fourth movement====
The final movement is set in sonata form. The lively, fanfare-like first theme is played by the entire orchestra, leading into a march-like interlude played by woodwind. After the return of the first theme, the first subject is concluded, and transitions directly into a massive, broad melody played by strings. After dying down to ''pianissimo'', the third movement is briefly recalled. Following this, the development section begins, which is in two sections, the first of which introduces new melodic ideas, and the latter of which revolves around a descending scale. The recapitulation initially only presents the first subject, before moving into a dominant pedal, building up to the triumphant restatement of the broad melody, in which fragments of the first theme, motto theme, and descending scale can be heard in the accompaniment. An emphatic coda brings the symphony to a close, with a fortissimo restatement of the brass chorale that appeared at the end of the second movement. The final bars present another fixture of Rachmaninoff's large-scale works, the characteristic four-note rhythm ending (in this case presented in a triplet rhythm), also heard in his [[Cello Sonata (Rachmaninoff)|Cello Sonata]], [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|second]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|third]] piano concertos, and in an altered form in his [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Rachmaninoff)|fourth]] piano concerto and [[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]].

==Derivative works==

A section of the symphony's second movement is used several times in the 2014 film ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'', directed by [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], and is even used in the trailers promoting it. It is featured as part of a score composed by Mexican jazz drummer [[Antonio Sánchez (drummer)|Antonio Sánchez]]. 

Parts of the third movement were used for [[pop music|pop singer]] [[Eric Carmen]]'s 1976 song, "[[Never Gonna Fall in Love Again]]", which borrowed the introduction and main melody of the third movement as the song's chorus and bridge, respectively. As Rachmaninoff's music was still in copyright at the time (it has since expired in most countries), Carmen was made to pay royalties to the Rachmaninoff estate for the use of the composer's music, both for the aforementioned song and [[All by Myself|"All By Myself]]", which borrowed from his second piano concerto in its verse. The melody was also used by [[jazz|jazz pianist]] [[Danilo Pérez]] as the main theme of his tune "If I Ever Forget You" on his 2008 album ''Across the Crystal Sea''.

In April 2008 [[Brilliant Classics]] released Alexander Warenberg's arrangement of the symphony for piano and orchestra, titling it "Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 5". Warenberg arranged Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2 as a [[concertante]] work for piano and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=190899|title=Arkivmusic.com|work=Rachmaninoff/Warenberg: Piano Concerto "No. 5|accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains about 40% of the source material from the symphony&lt;ref name="wakm"&gt;Warenberg (arkivmusic.com){{vague|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some original scoring by Warenberg, modification of the original score and a change to many of the harmonies "to improve the sound and balance".&lt;ref name="wakm" /&gt; Warenberg's arrangement calls for a three movement concerto with a new second movement and a revised finale "to create a tighter and more effective emotional climax to the concerto’s finale."&lt;ref name="wakm" /&gt;

'''Teatr Tworzenia''', or '''The Theater of Creation''', Polish avant-garde theater, founded by [[Jarosław Pijarowski]]. According to the author's definition it is: "Uninstitutionalized form of realization of creative ideas, consisting on intuitive-improvisational thematic activities; Have on the goal of integration and promotion of creative thought (word, music, theater, paintings) in audio-visual forms.&lt;ref name="information about realization"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pawlewicz|first1=Jakub|last2=Pijarowski|first2=Jarosław|title=OFF – Życie bez dotacji|date=2015|publisher=Arcanus &amp; ICB Polska|location=Bydgoszcz|isbn=978-83-88079-33-7|page=11|ref=information about realization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Enraged Musician''''' is a 1741 [[etching]] and [[engraving]] by English artist [[William Hogarth]] which depicts a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the cacophony outside his window. It was issued as companion piece to the third state of his print of ''[[The Distrest Poet]]''.

==Background==
In November 1740, Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: ''The Provok'd Musician'', ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'', and a third image on the subject of "Painting" . The third image was never completed, and the two other prints were issued together in November 1741. The engraving appears to be based on an oil sketch held in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], though there are some differences between the monochrome sketch and the engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=6634&amp;searchid=10433&amp;tabview=text|title=The Enraged Musician|publisher=Tate|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picture==

The image is ostensibly a purely comic scene. While the violinist attempts to rehearse, the noisiest inhabitants of London pass by his window. On the far left a squawking parrot perches above a pregnant ballad-seller singing "The Ladies' Fall" while holding her bawling baby. A young girl with a rattle (otherwise [[ratchet (instrument)]]) looks with amazement at a boy urinating below the musician's window (this is an often repeated image in Hogarth's work: similar scenes can be seen in ''[[The March to Finchley]]'' and in his illustrations for ''[[Hudibras]]'' and may be a reference to [[John Gay]]'s "[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Paulson p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The boy has a cord tied round his waist attached to a trailing slate which would clatter along the ground as he ran. In the centre of the picture a young milk-seller calling her wares provides the real focus of the picture; though set back more from the viewer than some of the subjects, she appears larger than the children and the crouching figure of the cutler. She balances a large pail of milk on her head and is the only subject that looks out at the viewer. This, combined with the large expanse of white apron, draws the viewer's eye towards her. [[Ronald Paulson]], the modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that she is singing and that her beauty and grace—she delicately lifts her skirt to avoid dragging it through the boy's urine—mark her out as the only natural musician in the scene; while the other inhabitants of the street produce discordant notes, the music of the violinist would be no better, because he has restricted himself by his studies and by removing himself from nature. He covers his ears to block out the cacophony of the street noise, but at the same time he denies himself the sweet music of the milkmaid's voice.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson p.115&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laroon the merry milk maid.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Savage (engraver)|John Savage]]'s etching of [[Marcellus Laroon]]'s (c.1688) ''The Merry Milk Maid''. Images of the ''Cryes'' genre may have been a target of Hogarth's satire; Laroon's ''The Cryes of the City of London'' was the most popular series of this type during Hogarth's lifetime.]]
The milkmaid is flanked on either side by street musicians: to her right a man plays a [[oboe|hautboy]], metaphorically thumbing his nose at the violinist; and to her left a small boy beats a drum. Behind the milkmaid, a paviour beats the ground with a heavy rammer. In the lower right-hand corner a dog barks at the racket created by a knife-grinder sharpening a cleaver. Behind these characters, a host of street vendors noisily announce their services: a dustman with a basket on his back rings a handbell, a sow-gelder blows a horn, and a [[fishmonger]] cups his hand to his mouth as he shouts. In the distance there is a hint of yet more noise. A church—traditionally identified as [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] yet closer in form to [[St Giles-in-the-Fields]]&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.200&lt;/ref&gt;—flies a flag, suggesting perhaps an important event during which bells would be rung. The building to the right is the works of pewterer John Long, from which would issue a constant ring of hammers, and on its roof two hissing cats with arched backs prepare to fight. Appearing from the chimney is a sweep who may be calling to an unseen colleague that his work is done. In the lower left corner some loose bricks—suggestive of building works out of view—have been piled up (no doubt noisily) into a little house. The long-nosed violinist framed in the open window clamps his hands to ears in frustration.&lt;ref name="Hallett"&gt;Hallett p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

While the image entertains purely by the number of references to noisy activities crammed into the scene, the play-bill for Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', prominently displayed on the wall next to the musician's window, hints at developments in British music at the time. ''The Beggar's Opera'' had enjoyed extraordinary success and had caused, or at least coincided with, a shift in the taste of audiences away from Italian opera and towards "British" music and homegrown culture. Hogarth was an enthusiastic supporter of the change in public tastes. He had mocked the vogue for continental fashions in many of his works (''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' both have scenes dedicated to the foolishness of the ''[[Levée]]'', and, in 1724, even before ''The Beggar's Opera'', in the earliest of his self-published satirical prints ''[[The Bad Taste of the Town]]'' Hogarth mocked the fashion for Italian opera and Italian opera singers). The play-bill here is anachronistic as it advertises the play with the original 1728 cast. The musician's identity has never been satisfactorily established. He is identified as an Italian both by Jean André Rouquet, whose French notes on the prints were approved by Hogarth, and by [[John Trusler]] who claimed Hogarth's widow's approval for his ''Hogarth Moralized''.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.201&lt;/ref&gt; He has been variously identified as a number of foreign musicians of the time, including "Corvetto, well known by the name of Nosee"&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth p.209&lt;/ref&gt; (probably [[Giacobbe Cervetto]], often caricaturized for his large nose), and [[Pietro Castrucci]], the leader of [[Handel]]'s orchestra. Handel had noted the shift in public taste himself, and from the 1730s he composed more English oratorio and theatre works, including the setting the works of [[John Milton|Milton]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]] and [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]] to music.&lt;ref name="Hallett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; Hogarth, as well as comically juxtaposing high and low culture, could be suggesting that a foreign tradition is being silenced by a burgeoning sense of Britishness. This may have been an afterthought though, as the playbill was not present in the earliest impressions, and the hautboy player and paver are usually respectively identified as Jewish and Irish, while the drummer boy is dressed in the same fashion as the young [[Huguenot]] leaving the church in ''Noon'', the second scene of Hogarth's ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''. The musician has also been identified as John Festin (mistakenly rendered as Foster in some accounts), a teacher of the flute and hautboy, by Hogarth's friend and biographer John Ireland and later by the commentator John Trusler. The story Festin told Hogarth obviously provided the inspiration for at least part of the scene:

{{quote|I once waited upon my lord Spencer, but his lordship being out of town, from him I went to Mr. V——n. It was so early that he was not arisen. I went into his chamber, and, opening a shutter, sat down in the window-seat. Before the rails was a fellow playing upon the hautboy. A man with a barrow full of onions offered the piper an onion if he would play him a tune. That ended, he offered a second onion for a second tune; the same for a third, and was going on: but this was too much; I could not bear it; it angered my very soul—'Zounds!' said I, 'stop here! This fellow is ridiculing my profession; he is playing on the hautboy for onions!'&lt;ref&gt;Trusler p.64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The hautboy player has similarly defied identification. Charles Frederick Weideman, a leading London flautist, who had played the oboe earlier in his career, has been suggested as the flautist seen playing in plate 4 of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', and in ''The Enraged Musician: Hogarth's Musical Imagery'', Jeremy Barlow claims that he and the hautboy player are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.204&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of many street traders may also satirise [[Marcellus Laroon]]'s much-copied 17th-century prints of ''The Cryes of the City of London'' and more recent images by Hogarth's rival, [[Giacomo Amiconi]].

==Variations==
[[Image:Enragedmusician trial.jpg|thumb|right|The early trial was not as crowded or, by extension, as noisy, as the issued print. The character of the drummer boy was most changed between versions, but other subjects also underwent alterations, and more features were added.]]
An early trial impression was missing the church steeple, cats, the man blowing the horn and the play-bill. In this version the dustman was missing his nose (a sign that he was syphilitic), a doll was placed in the model brick house in the foreground, and the drummer boy sported a Grenadier's cap. The drummer was handsome and had turned to look towards the little girl. By the time the print was issued this suggestion of a domestic theme with the boy, girl, and house with "child" had been removed. The boy had his cap removed and his handsome face turned away from the girl and replaced by features which [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] described as "idiotic".&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; The doll was removed and the girl given a rattle to add to the image of pure noise.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson. p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Later copies featured a black horse in place of the white horse ridden by the horn blower and showed cross-hatching on the sleeves of the ballad-seller and the play-bill. Later impressions also made the dog and grinder darker, while lightening the cap of the sow-gelder.&lt;ref name="Hogarth2"&gt;Hogarth p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The King's Sick Son''''' or '''''Antiochus and Stratonice''''' is a c.1700 painting by the Italian painter [[Antonio Bellucci]], now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]. Also painted by [[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease|David]] and [[The Illness of Antiochus|Ingres]], the subject is [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]] falling mortally ill after secretly falling in love with his father's new wife [[Stratonice of Syria]].

[[Goethe]] saw the painting as a young man and described it several times in ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]]'' (1821).

'''''The Tales of Hoffmann''''' is a 1951 British Technicolor film adaptation of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'', written, produced and directed by the team of [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] working under the umbrella of their production company, [[Powell and Pressburger|The Archers]].

The [[opera film]] stars [[Robert Rounseville]], [[Moira Shearer]], [[Robert Helpmann]] and [[Léonide Massine]], and features [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]], [[Ludmilla Tchérina]] and [[Ann Ayars]]. Only Rounseville and Ayars sang their own roles.

It uses a soundtrack recorded for the film conducted by Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]; principal singers apart from Rounseville and Ayars were [[Dorothy Bond]], [[Margherita Grandi]], [[Monica Sinclair]] and Bruce Dargavel; the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] plays. The film's production team includes cinematographer [[Christopher Challis]] and production and costume designer [[Hein Heckroth]], who was nominated for two [[24th Academy Awards|1952 Academy Award]]s for his work.

==Plot==
{{See also|The Tales of Hoffmann#Plot}}
*In the prologue, [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]] is in the audience at a performance by Stella, a [[prima ballerina]], of "The Ballet of the Enchanted Dragonfly". Stella sends Hoffmann a note asking him to meet her after the performance, but the note is intercepted by his rival, Councillor Lindorf. Not having received her note,  Hoffmann goes to the tavern in the interval, where he tells the story of a clown, Kleinzach, and three stories of his past loves — Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia, and gets drunk.
*In the first story, Olympia is an [[automaton]] created by scientist Spalanzani  and magic spectacle maker Coppelius. Hoffmann falls for the doll, ignorant of her artifice and is mocked when he finally discovers she is 'automatic'.
*In the second story, Hoffmann in [[Venice]] falls for Giulietta, a [[courtesan]], but she seduces him to steal his reflection for the magician Dapertutto.
*In the third story, Antonia is a [[soprano]] suffering from an incurable illness and must not sing, but  the evil Dr Miracle makes her sing and she dies, breaking the hearts of Hoffmann and her father, Crespel.
*Finally, in the epilogue, Hoffmann explains that all three women are all aspects of his love, Stella, who then appears in the tavern and, seeing Hoffmann drunk and incapable, is led away by Councillor Lindorf.

==Adaptation==
Though the original French libretto is presented in English translation, the film is relatively faithful to the traditional adaptations of Offenbach's last opera, and incorporates his unfinished score with the thread of the plot. However, certain important changes were made in the process of adapting the story to film: 
*In the prologue of the film, all of Lindorf's music is excluded, making him a silent character. 
*Stella's profession is changed from an opera singer appearing in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to a ballet dancer. 
*"The Tale of Antonia" is shortened, ending with the powerful trio for Antonia, the Ghost of her mother, and Dr. Miracle rather than Antonia's death scene. 
*The role of Nicklaus is abridged, though Nicklaus (as played by Pamela Brown) still appears.

==Production==
In the later years of their partnership, Powell became interested in what he termed "a composed film", a marriage of image to operatic music. The finale of ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and the ballet sequence of ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' were earlier steps toward his goal.

''The Tales of Hoffmann'' is an achievement of this ideal, as the entire opera was pre-recorded to create the soundtrack, and the movie was edited to the rhythms of the music. The production is completely without dialogue and, with the exception of Robert Rounseville and Ann Ayars, none of the actors did their own singing. Some of the singers had established careers in Britain at the time. Grahame Clifford, for example, had been a leading comedian with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] for several years, and Monica Sinclair was fast becoming an audience favourite at [[Covent Garden]]; she would later become one of the company's most popular artists of the next two decades. The acting (especially by Helpmann) is highly stylised and similar to that of the silent film era.

Each tale is marked by its own individual primary colour, denoting its theme. "The Tale of Olympia", set in Paris, has yellow contours highlighting the farcical nature and tone of the first act. "The Tale of Giulietta" is a hellish depiction of Venice, where dark colours, especially red, are used. The final tale, set in Greece, uses different shades of blue, alluding to its sad nature. The set design is deliberately made to look artificial with the costumes similarly stylised. The opening scene of the "Tale of Giulietta" (where Giulietta performs the "[[Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour|Barcarolle]]", the most famous theme of the opera) is staged on a gondola which moves through deliberately artificial Venetian canals, although it does not seem to actually move on the water.

''The Tales of Hoffmann'' was in production from 1–16 July 1950 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Shepperton]], Surrey, in the UK

==Critical reception==
Following its world premiere in New York City, [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[D]espite its opulence, coupled with a brilliant rendering of the score by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]'s bristling baton and some masterly singing of the [[libretto]] (in English) by a host of vocal cords, this film version of the opera is, ''in toto'', a vastly wearying show. And that is because it sates the senses without striking any real dramatic fire ... The inevitable question about this picture is how close does it come to matching the beauty and excitement of the same producers {{sic}} ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''? Although the two films are basically different, a comparison is fair to this extent: ''The Red Shoes'' had warmth and vitality, ''Tales of Hoffmann'' is splendid and cold.&lt;ref name="nyt51"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Tales of Hoffmann'' Arrives; Lavish British Picture, With Huge Cast of Entertainers, Makes Bow at Bijou|date=5 April 1951|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE1DC1231E23BBC4D53DFB266838A649EDE|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|authorlink=Bosley Crowther|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reportedly, [[Cecil B. DeMille]] sent a letter to Powell and Pressburger, saying, "For the first time in my life, I was treated to Grand Opera where the beauty, power and scope of the music was equally matched by the visual presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/51_Hoffmann/Hoff02.html|title= Fan Letter | first= Cecil B.|last= DeMille| authorlink= Cecil B. DeMille| publisher= powell-pressburger.org| accessdate= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll, [[George A. Romero]] called it his "favourite film of all time; the movie that made me want to make movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=George+A.&amp;surname=Romero | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021026160507/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=George+A.&amp;surname=Romero | archivedate= 26 October 2002 | title= George A. Romero: Top Ten | publisher= [[British Film Institute]]| accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years earlier, Romero had introduced the film as part of the "Dialogues: Talking with Pictures" programme at the [[1999 Toronto International Film Festival#Dialogues: Talking with Pictures|1999 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://preview.reelviews.net/tiff99/tiff1.html |title= 1999 Toronto International Film Festival Daily Update #1: "And They're Off..." | first= James |last=Berardinelli | authorlink= James Berardinelli| date=
9 September 1999 |publisher=ReelViews.net | accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romero later taped an interview for the [[Criterion Collection]] edition of the film, discussing his love of the film and its influence on his career. Additionally, [[Martin Scorsese]], an ardent fan of Powell and Pressburger, provides an audio commentary track on the Criterion edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.criterion.com/films/748-the-tales-of-hoffmann|title= The Tales of Hoffman | first= Criterion|last= Collection| authorlink= Criterion Collection| publisher= criterion.com| accessdate= 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book on the British cinema, [[André Bazin]] is quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cinema thus creates here a new artistic monster: the best legs adorned by the best voice. Not only is opera liberated from its material constraints but also from its human limitations. Lastly, dance itself is renewed by the photography and the editing, which allows a kind of choreography of the second degree where the rhythm of the dance is served by that of the cinema.&lt;ref name=Bazin&gt;Bazin is quoted (and translated) in {{cite book |title=Cross-channel Perspectives: the French Reception of British Cinema |last=Kimmer |first=Leila |page=54 |publisher= Peter Lang |year=2009 |isbn=978-3-03911-360-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVOpdFnn9loC&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accolades==
At the [[24th Academy Awards]], ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' received two nominations, both for [[Hein Heckroth]], for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design, Color]]; the awards in both cases went to the crew of ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]''.

Powell and Pressburger were nominated for the Grand Prize of the [[1951 Cannes Film Festival]], and won the Exceptional Prize.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4085/year/1951.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' |accessdate=16 January 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also won the [[Silver Bear]] award for "Best Musical" at the [[1st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1951"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1951/03_preistr_ger_1951/03_Preistraeger_1951.html |title=1st Berlin International Film Festival: Prize Winners |accessdate=21 December 2009 |work= berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allmovie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:73712~T4 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was recorded at Shepperton Studios between May and September 1950, conducted by Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]. Decca obtained permission from London Films to release the soundtrack on LP. In response, Beecham sued: he had not approved the release, because the soundtrack did not truly represent his interpretation of the opera, due to the changes made for the film. On 20 March 1951 he failed to obtain a High Court injunction to prevent the release, but received assurances that it would be clearly labelled as taken from the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/discography/decca.html|title=Decca Classical discography, 1929-2009|website=Charm.rhul.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 re-release==
In March 2015, the [[4K resolution|4K restoration]] of the film, produced by [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[The Film Foundation]], the [[British Film Institute]], and [[Studiocanal]], was released in the U.S. by [[Rialto Pictures]]. The restored version runs 136 minutes, including a final [[title sequence|credits sequence]] of all the performers and singers, not seen in any previous releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rialtopictures.com/catalogue/the-tales-of-hoffmann |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226182304/http://www.rialtopictures.com/catalogue/the-tales-of-hoffmann |archivedate=26 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Men Contemplating the Moon''''' ({{lang-de|'''Zwei Männer in Betrachtung des Mondes'''}}) and '''''Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon''''' are a series of similar paintings by [[Caspar David Friedrich]], the setting being among his best-known works.&lt;ref name=heilbronn&gt;{{cite web|title=Heilbronn Timeline of Art History|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.51|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich painted at least three versions, with one variation featuring a man and a woman. The 1819–20 version in the [[Galerie Neue Meister]] is thought to be the original; the c. 1824 variant with a woman is in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]]; and the c. 1830 version is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. 

These [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] [[landscape painting]]s feature two figures in a dark forest silhouetted by a pastel sky. The works' dark foregrounds and lighter backgrounds create a sharp contrast. The sky suggests that the time is around dusk, with the waxing crescent moon close to setting. A dead, uprooted tree's dark roots and branches contrast with the sky. The jagged branches and stark contrasts seem to create a threatening environment for the figures, and are reminiscent of the imposing Gothic style seen originally in the medieval era, but revived in the Romantic era. The same can be said of the dark, shadowy trees and rocks surrounding the couple. The figures themselves are dressed in dark colors and stiff, somewhat formal garments, which also serve to signify their higher class. The works emphasize spirituality in nature and the presence of the sublime, which are major themes of Friedrich. 

Playwright [[Samuel Beckett]], standing before ''Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon'', said "This was the source of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', you know."&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Cristin, "[http://www.helnwein.com/press/selected_articles/article_3595-Old-romantics-tug-at-the-heart Old Romantics Tug at the Heart]".

==Image description and composition==
The paintings depicts a foreground scene of two people on a mountain path, which leads up from the centre bottom of the picture to the left. The man on the right is wearing a grey-green cape and the black beret of the ''[[altdeutsche Tracht]]'' and has a stick in his right hand. The man on the left is somewhat higher on the path and is leaning on his companion's shoulder; he is slimmer and is wearing a grey-green frock-coat, from which a white collar protrudes, and the black cap of an early ''[[Burschenschaft]]'', its ribbon tied under his chin. They are both looking at the sickle of the waxing moon and the [[Venus|evening star]]. The moon's night side is lit by [[Planetshine#Earthshine|earthshine]]. The scene is framed by an uprooted and moss-grown oak on their right, whose branches reach out to those of a spruce on their left; a boulder prevents the oak from falling, and there is another boulder on the left. In the background the landscape falls away; the tops of pine trees suggest a forest. In the immediate foreground are a tree stump and a large dry branch lying on the ground. The painting is almost monochromatic in shades of brown and grey, depicting nightfall. 

The Dresden version is generally held to be the original, because it most perfectly exemplifies the [[golden section]] in the ratios between the central vertical axis, the perpendicular axis between it and the star, and the other axis running through the older man's eye.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Busch, ''Caspar David Friedrich. Ästhetik und Religion'' Munich: Beck, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;179 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German art historian [[Werner Busch]] sees the geometric layout as signalling the transcendent message of the two figures' experience of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; As in many paintings by Friedrich, there is no middle ground; the foreground earthly scene is contrasted with the lighted sky and the abyss at the two men's feet made perceptible through this contrast, which exemplifies the antithetical relationship of rational, palpable earthly space and irrational and sublime infinity explored by the [[Romanticism|Romantic painters]]. The composition places these in a harmonious relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Geismeier, ''Caspar David Friedrich'', 5th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 1990, {{ISBN|9783363003406}} {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a defining image of German Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two men depicted may be Friedrich himself, on the right, and his pupil August Heinrich (1794–1822) on the left;&lt;ref name=heilbronn/&gt; Friedrich's friend Wilhelm Wegener gave this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Verzeichnis356&gt;Börsch-Supan and Jähnig, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl agreed that the younger man was Heinrich but identified the older as Christian Wilhelm Bommer, the brother of Friedrich's wife Caroline;&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; however, in 1819, Heinrich was 25 but Bommer only 18.&lt;ref name=Verzeichnis356/&gt; In the variant with a man and a woman, Caroline Friedrich would then be the woman. Two art historians of the early twentieth century also proposed locations. Max Semrau located Friedrich and his friend Benjamin Friedrich Gotthelf Kummer on a cliff on the island of [[Rügen]];&lt;ref&gt;Max Semrau, ''Caspar David Friedrich, der Greifswalder Maler. Bilder aus Greifswalds Vergangenheit'', Greifswald, 1917, p.&amp;nbsp;19 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Sauerlandt, the same two men in the [[Harz Mountains]].

===''Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon''===

In this painting, the man and woman face away from the viewer, centered vertically, and located left of center horizontally. The woman's arm is resting on the man's shoulder.  The serene and contemplative pose of the couple contrasts with the contortions of the half uprooted oak tree, which is itself in opposition with the verticality of the lush pine tree on the left. This irregular and asymmetrical pictorial construction—one linked with the post-Baroque aesthetic of the previous century—was fairly rare in Friedrich's work, often characterized by regular geometric arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Sala, Charles. Terrail. ''Caspar David Friedrich: The Spirit of Romantic Painting''. Bayard Press S.A. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==

According to [[Johan Christian Dahl]], the first owner of the (presumed) earliest version, Friedrich painted an unknown number of copies, and others also copied the picture.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;[[Johan Christian Dahl]], letter to the Saxon Royal Gallery, ''Acta der Königl. Gemäldegallerie betr. 1840–1844'', VII, No. 35, pp.&amp;nbsp;66–67 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several versions are extant today, but their dating and authorship has not been positively determined; discussion of the question was revived in 1991.&lt;ref name=Monrad&gt;Kasper Monrad, "Friedrich and Two Danish Moonwatchers", in ''Caspar David Friedrich: Moonwatchers'', ed. Sabine Rewald, Exhibition catalogue, New York: [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] / New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University, 2001, {{ISBN|9780300092981}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Dahl's copy (now in Dresden) there is a version in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, dated 1825–1830. In addition to the closer adherence to the golden section, the Dresden version is truer to Friedrich's preparatory sketches from nature. 

Paintings of the variant image of a man and woman observing the moon (''Mann und Frau den Mond betrachtend''), dated between 1818 and 1835, are located in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin and in a private collection in Switzerland. The art historian Kaspar Monrad suggests that this may be the first version of the theme, and thus would predate early 1818, when the Danish writer Peder Hjort reported obtaining such a painting from Friedrich.&lt;ref name=Monrad/&gt; In addition to substituting the figure of a woman for the man on the left, the Berlin version differs from ''Two Men Contemplating the Moon'' in many details: the stump is broken rather than sawed, as it is in the Dresden version, the dead branch has been omitted, the tops of the trees on the right are higher, and decisively, the walking stick has been omitted, although [[X-ray]] examination reveals two lines indicating where the artist had planned to include it.&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Verwiebe, ''Caspar David Friedrich: Der Watzmann'', Exhibition catalogue, [[Berlin State Museums]], Cologne: DuMont, 2004, {{ISBN|9783832174842}}, p.&amp;nbsp;111 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting in the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden was included in 1830 in [[Johan Christian Dahl]]'s collection under the title ''Mondscheinlandschaft. Zwei männliche Figuren betrachten den aufgehenden Halbmond'' (Moonlit Landscape: Two Male Figures Observing the Rising Half-Moon); he sold it to the Royal Art Gallery in Dresden in 1840 for 80&amp;nbsp;[[Thaler|taler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Börsch-Supan and Karl Wilhelm Jähnig, ''Caspar David Friedrich. Gemälde, Druckgraphik und bildmäßige Zeichnungen'', Munich: Prestel, 1973, {{ISBN|3-7913-0053-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;356 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl had obtained the painting from Friedrich in exchange for a work of his own. The painting in Berlin of a man and a woman was at the Salomon art dealership in Dresden in 1922. In 1932 it was shown at the Paul Cassirer gallery in Berlin on loan from the collection of Lulu Böhler in [[Lucerne]], and it was bought that year by the Alte Nationalgalerie from the Fritz Nathan Gallery of Lucerne.&lt;ref&gt;Börsch-Supan and Jähnig, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
With its softly melancholy mood, the painting epitomises the Romantic view of nature. The two meditative figures, seen almost entirely from the rear, serve as representatives of the observer, who is left to contemplate what they are seeing and supply a meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Busch, "Zum Verständnis und Interpretation romantischer Kunst", in: Werner Busch ''et al''., ''Romantik'', Arte Fakten, Annweiler: Plöger, 1987, {{ISBN|9783924574130}}, p.&amp;nbsp;48 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Romantic mysticism of the tension between the palpable world and the unending cosmos, three additional contrasting interpretations have been presented, in terms of religion, politics  and biography. 

===Religion===
The German art historian [[Helmut Börsch-Supan]] interprets the evergreen spruce and the dead oak as symbols of the Christian worldview and defeated paganism, respectively, the path as the path of life and the waxing moon as Christ. The oak has traditionally represented history and transience, the evergreen fir-tree, the constantly renewing power of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The uprooted tree may represent death, yet its contrast with the clear, bright sky represents hope, eternal life, and closeness to the sublime, or Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Catherine, Helmut R. Leppien, and Kasper Monrad. ''Baltic Light: Early Open-Air Painting in Denmark and North Germany''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Börsch-Supan, Helmut. “Caspar David Friedrich's Landscapes with Self-Portraits.” ''The Burlington Magazine'' 114, no. 834 (September 1972): 620–630.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
The ''altdeutsche Tracht'' worn by both men was banned under the [[Carlsbad decrees]] of 1819, coinciding with the creation of the work. Friedrich himself pointed to the importance of this political aspect in interpreting the work; [[Karl Förster]] recounts in his memoirs that on a visit to the artist's studio in Dresden on 9 April 1820, Friedrich showed him the painting and "said, ironically as if in explanation, 'They are fomenting demagogic intrigues'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Förster]], ''Biographische und literarische Skizzen aus dem Leben und der Zeit Karl Förster's'', Dresden 1846, p.&amp;nbsp;157: "'Die machen demagogische Umtriebe', sagte Friedrich ironisch, wie zur Erklärung."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Friedrich's paintings feature people in this political costume, suggesting he intended a political message against their suppression; however, the sketches and most of the paintings predate the ban.

'''''Woodstock Mural''''' is a [[mural]] designed by artist Mike Lawrence, painted on the west side of the [[New Seasons Market]] store in the [[Woodstock, Portland, Oregon|Woodstock]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. The painting has three sections, each representing a theme: commerce, education, and the outdoors. It depicts figures adorned with symbolism related to characters in [[Greek mythology]], including [[Hermes]], [[Athena]], and [[Demeter]], along with local businesses and local landmarks such as the neighborhood [[farmers' market]], [[Grand Central Bakery]], Portland Fish Market, [[Woodstock Park (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock Park]], and the [[Woodstock Library]].

The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans for a mural on the exterior wall of [[Lutz Tavern]]. Following an outreach effort to identify an artist, Lawrence and WNA met for a brainstorming session, during which they agreed on theme's for the proposed public artwork. Even after some funding was secured, efforts stalled. The association later proposed a mural for the nearby Red Fox Vintage building.

The original mural was completed on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced the construction of a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered to reproduce the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce the mural, which was completed in October 2015.

According to the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]] (RACC), each section includes a central figure adorned with symbolism associated with [[Greek mythology]], representing one of three themes: commerce, education, and the outdoors.&lt;ref name=RACC&gt;{{cite web|title=New mural for the Woodstock Neighborhood|url=http://www.racc.org/public-art/new-mural-woodstock-neighborhood|publisher=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|accessdate=November 7, 2015|date=December 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022813/http://www.racc.org/public-art/new-mural-woodstock-neighborhood|archive-date=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Portland Tribune]]'' described the mural as "rich in latent symbolism with more mysterious content", referring to the mythological symbolism in particular.&lt;ref name=Finally&gt;{{cite news|last=MacKinnon|first=Merry|title=Woodstock finally gets its neighborhood mural on the boulevard|url=http://portlandtribune.com/sb/75-features/204786-woodstock-finally-gets-its-neighborhood-mural-on-the-boulevard|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|date=December 22, 2013|oclc=46708462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting measured {{Convert|54|ft|m}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; In 2015, the mural was reproduced on another wall following construction of an adjacent new building housing a [[New Seasons Market]]; the new building hid the original mural. The "imposing" reproduction, as described by ''The Bee'', a community newspaper, measures {{Convert|52|ft|m}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Bee&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Elizabeth Ussher|title=Mural, covered by New Seasons Market, reappears as promised|url=http://www.readthebee.com/businesswantads.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commerce, represented on the left side, is depicted by a shopkeeper wearing a hat with the wings of [[Hermes]], the Greek god of commerce (or, according to some sources, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the Roman god of commerce).&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The business owner is bearded and wears a [[crocus]] flower in his apron. He has a tattoo of the [[caduceus]], the staff carried by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] and Hermes in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; In his store is a shelf with other symbolic items that represent local businesses.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

The center section is devoted to education and depicts [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, in the form of a girl in the [[Woodstock Library]].&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; She is adorned with an owl on her shoulder and an [[olive branch]] necklace. She holds a tiger lily in her hand. [[Woodstock School (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock School]]'s Mandarin Immersion Program is honored with an arc of [[Chinese characters]] above the girl's head, written on a chalkboard. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] text translates to "A nice place to live"&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; or "It's a great place to live", which is Woodstock's motto.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; According to ''The Bee'', the central section also represents other neighborhood schools and the neighborhood's close proximity to [[Reed College]].&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

The mural's right section depicts [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of the harvest, in the form of an Asian female urban farmer at the neighborhood [[farmers' market]]. She wears [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]] in her headdress, giving the appearance of a crown, and has a tattoo of a [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] of wheat. Next to her is a [[cornucopia]], which symbolizes abundance and nourishment. She holds a lotus staff, described as a "flaming torch".&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The figure also represents "the love of gardening". [[Douglas fir]] trees and [[Woodstock Park (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock Park]], specifically its off-leash dog area, are also depicted in the painting's right section.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lutz Tavern (2014) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The mural was originally planned for the exterior wall of [[Lutz Tavern]].]]

The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans to paint a community mural on the east exterior of [[Lutz Tavern]].&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Following an outreach effort to locate an artist, WNA and Lawrence held a brainstorming session. Kenny Heggem, who served as the project manager of the mural committee,&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outreach &amp; Communications|url=http://woodstockpdx.org/committees/communications/|publisher=Woodstock Neighborhood Association|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; recalled, "We talked about our fantastic park and its leash-free dog area, Woodstock Elementary's Mandarin Immersion Program, and our awesome library."&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; The session resulted in the group's choosing the mural's three themes.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

In August 2012, RACC confirmed funding of $6,000 for the {{Convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} painting. The mural's design was divided into three parts to accommodate the exterior wall's three sections. RACC published an image of Lawrence's proposed mural and said the goal of the project was to "highlight the best of the neighborhood and instill a sense of community pride".&lt;ref name=Six&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland will add six new public art murals to its collection this summer|url=https://racc.org/2012/08/10/portland-will-add-six-new-public-art-murals-to-its-collection-this-summer/|publisher=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|accessdate=November 7, 2015|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also said the project was still raising funds and hoped to start in the spring of 2013.&lt;ref name=Six/&gt; Efforts stalled, but WNA later proposed a mural with a different design for the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building, located at the intersection of Southeast 46th Avenue and Southeast Woodstock Boulevard.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt;

According to the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'', the project was a collaboration between local businesses, institutions, and neighborhood residents. Beaver State Scaffolding and [[Sherwin-Williams]] both contributed resources to the project.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; RACC awarded partial grant funding through its Public Art Murals Program, which is funded by the City of Portland and "provides funding for community murals that reflect diversity in style and media and encourages artists from diverse backgrounds and range of experience to apply".&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Six/&gt; WNA volunteers also assisted, led by Heggem and Becky Luening, head of the neighborhood association.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder&gt;{{cite news|last=Binder|first=Melissa|title=New Seasons in Woodstock: Neighborhood mural will be replicated, traffic guided by audible, visual signals (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/03/new_seasons_in_woodstock_updat.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=[[The Oregonian]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art &amp; Design served as the project's production manager.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Painting the mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Woodstock Mural (covered), 2015.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The original mural covered by new construction]]

Not long after the mural's completion, New Seasons Market announced plans to build a new store immediately adjacent to the mural.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt; In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, "We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about the mural. To the best of my knowledge, New Seasons will make it right."&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Merry|title=Finally official: New Seasons IS coming to Woodstock|url=http://pamplinmedia.com/sb/75-features/209044-66200-finally-official-new-seasons-is-coming-to-woodstock|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting the mural on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping the original mural in place and making it visible from the grocery store's interior.&lt;ref name=Official/&gt;

New Seasons met with WNA and offered to reproduce the painting, either on the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Binder|first1=Melissa|title=New Seasons Woodstock|url=http://photos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2014/03/new_seasons_woodstock.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Oregonian|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt; New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a "mega mural" painter. He said of the process: &lt;blockquote&gt;I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [to create the underlying design] that works like an arc welder.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During construction of the new building and the mural's transfer, New Seasons displayed a banner which read, "The mural will return".&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=David F.|title=Woodstock's New Seasons to open October 21|url=http://portlandtribune.com/sb/75-features/275290-150504-woodstocks-new-seasons-to-open-october-21|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee|date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen and his assistant, Christo Wunderlich, transferred the design using a machine, then painted the art by hand. The duo also added bread and a fish to the mural to represent the local businesses [[Grand Central Bakery]] and Portland Fish Market, respectively.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; The new store opened in October 2015.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

'''''Young Person's Guide to History''''' is a two-part television special produced by [[Funny Garbage]], the creators of ''[[Saul of the Mole Men]]'', and features most of the same actors and creative team. It was originally titled ''Thomas Jefferson American Phantasm''.

In the United States, the first part aired on October 27, 2008 and the second part aired on November 3, 2008 on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]]. On November 4, 2008 ''Young Person's Guide to History'' first aired in its entirety, in honor of [[United States elections, 2008|election night]]. It was originally produced in three parts but was edited down to two.

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}
''Young Person's Guide to History'' is a warped and absurd retelling of historical events that led to the creation of [[United States|America]] such as the writing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the choosing of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal of America]] using fantastical and [[anachronism|anachronistic]] modern elements ([[Thomas Jefferson]] tattoos the Constitution onto his chest and then tears it off).

''Young Person's Guide to History'' is an offshoot/spinoff of the ''Saul of the Mole Men'' episode "Poor Clancy's Almanack", a wordplay on ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]''.
Another reference is made when the song "Mustache Ride" is played in Jefferson's car during part one.

Directed by Peter Girardi and [[Dave Willis]], both parts of ''Young Person's Guide to History'' were rated [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA]] in the United States.
