Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">In [[computer science]], specifically in [[algorithm]]s related to [[pathfinding]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''admissible''' if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Search algorithms ==
An admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost of reaching the 
goal state in an [[informed search algorithm]]. In order for a heuristic
to be admissible to the search problem, the estimated cost must always 
be lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state. 
The search algorithm uses the admissible heuristic to find an estimated 
optimal path to the goal state from the current node. 
For example, in [[A* search]] the evaluation function (where 
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the current node) is:

&lt;math&gt;f(n) = g(n) + h(n)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; = the evaluation function.
:&lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; = the cost from the start node to the current node
:&lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; = estimated cost from current node to goal.

&lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is calculated using the heuristic 
function. With a non-admissible heuristic, the A* algorithm could 
overlook the optimal solution to a search problem due to an 
overestimation in &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formulation==

: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a node
: &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a heuristic
: &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is cost indicated by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to reach a goal from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal cost to reach a goal from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is admissible if, &lt;math&gt;\forall n&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;h(n) \leq h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt;

==Construction==
An admissible heuristic can be derived from a [[Relaxation (approximation)|relaxed]]
version of the problem, or by information from pattern databases that store exact solutions to subproblems of the problem, or by using [[Inductive transfer|inductive learning]] methods.

==Examples==
Two different examples of admissible heuristics apply to the [[fifteen puzzle]] problem:
* [[Hamming distance]]
* [[Manhattan distance]]

The [[Hamming distance]] is the total number of misplaced tiles. It is clear that this heuristic is admissible since the total number of moves to order the tiles correctly is at least the number of misplaced tiles (each tile not in place must be moved at least once). The cost (number of moves) to the goal (an ordered puzzle) is at least the [[Hamming distance]] of the puzzle.

The Manhattan distance of a puzzle is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;h(n)=\sum_\text{all tiles} \mathit{distance}(\text{tile, correct position})&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the puzzle below in which the player wishes to move each tile such that the numbers are ordered. The Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic in this case because every tile will have to be moved at least the number of spots in between itself and its correct position.&lt;ref name="Korf,2000"&gt;{{Citation | first=Richard E. | last=Korf | contribution-url=https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2000/AAAI00-212.pdf | doi=10.1007/3-540-44914-0_3 | contribution=Recent progress in the design and analysis of admissible heuristic functions | series=SARA 2000.

The subscripts show the Manhattan distance for each tile. The total Manhattan distance for the shown puzzle is:
:&lt;math&gt;h(n)=3+1+0+1+2+3+3+4+3+2+4+4+4+1+1=36&lt;/math&gt;

==Optimality Guarantee==
If an admissible heuristic is adapted in an algorithm (for example in [[A* search algorithm]]), then this algorithm would eventually find an optimal solution to the goal. A well-known and easy-to-understand example is [[breadth-first search]]. In the case of BFS, the heuristic evaluation function &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; equals to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for each node &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which is obviously less than the actual cost (thus '''underestimated'''). This heuristic would cause the BFS algorithm to search literally all the possible paths and eventually find the optimal solution (i.e., the shortest path to the goal).

As an example&lt;ref&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23970588/why-do-admissable-heuristics-guarantee-optimality&lt;/ref&gt; of why admissibility can guarantee optimality, let's say we have costs as follows:(the cost above/below a node is the heuristic, the cost at an edge is the actual cost)

  0     10   0   100   0
 START ----  O  ----- GOAL
  |                   |
 0|                   |100
  |                   | 
  O ------- O  ------ O
 100   1    100   1   100

So clearly we'd start off visiting the top middle node, since the expected total cost, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;10 + 0 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. Then the goal would be a candidate, with &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;10+100+0=110&lt;/math&gt;. Then we'd clearly pick the bottom nodes one after the other, followed by the updated goal, since they all have &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; lower than the &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; of the current goal, i.e. their &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;100, 101, 102, 102&lt;/math&gt;. So even though the goal was a candidate, we couldn't pick it because there were still better paths out there. This way, an admissible heuristic can ensure optimality.

However, note that although an admissible heuristic can guarantee final optimality, it's not necessarily efficient.

==Notes==
While all [[consistent heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.

For tree search problems, if an admissible heuristic is used, the [[A* search algorithm]] will never return a suboptimal goal node.

'''Biblical minimalism''', also known as the '''Copenhagen School''' because two of its most prominent figures taught at [[Copenhagen University]], was a movement or trend in [[biblical scholarship]] that began in the 1990s with two main claims: 
# that the Bible cannot be considered reliable evidence for what had happened in ancient Israel; and  
# that "Israel" itself is a problematic subject for historical study.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;pg=PA33#v=snippet&amp;q=two%20main%20claims&amp;f=false 33]}}

Minimalism was not a unified movement, but rather a label that came to be applied to several scholars at different universities who held similar views, chiefly [[Niels Peter Lemche]] and [[Thomas L. Thompson]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Philip R. Davies]], and [[Keith Whitelam]]. Minimalism gave rise to intense debate during the 1990s—the term "minimalists" was in fact a derogatory one given by its opponents, who were consequently dubbed "maximalists", but in fact neither side accepted either label. 

The so-called Maximalists, or [[Biblical archaeology school#William F. Albright and the Biblical Archaeology school|neo-Albrightians]], were composed of two quite distinct groups, the first represented by the archaeologist [[William G. Dever|William Dever]] and the influential publication ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', the second by biblical scholar [[Iain Provan]] and Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]].{{sfn|Banks|2006|p=185}} Although these debates were in some cases heated, most scholars occupied the middle ground evaluating the arguments of both schools critically. 

Since the 1990s, while some of the minimalist arguments have been challenged or rejected, others have been refined and adopted into the mainstream of biblical scholarship.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011}}

==Background: academic study of the Bible in the 20th century==
By the opening of the 20th century the stories of the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], [[Noah's ark]], and the [[Tower of Babel]]—in short, chapters 1 to 11 of the [[Book of Genesis]]—had become subject to greater scrutiny by scholars, and the starting point for biblical history was regarded as the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and the other [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew patriarchs]]. Then in the 1970s, largely through the publication of two books, [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' it became widely accepted that the remaining chapters of Genesis were equally non-historical. At the same time, archaeology and comparative sociology convinced most scholars in the field that there was equally little historical basis to the biblical stories of [[the Exodus]] and the Israelite conquest of Canaan.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=18-20}}

By the 1980s, the Bible's stories of the Patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt and Conquest of Canaan were no longer considered historical, but biblical histories continued to use the Bible as a primary source and to take the form of narrative records of political events arranged in chronological order, with the major role played by (largely Judean) kings and other high-status individuals. At the same time, new tools and approaches were being brought to bear on scholars' knowledge of the past of ancient Canaan, notably new archaeological methods and approaches (for example, this was the age of surface surveys, used to map population changes which are invisible in the biblical narrative), and the social sciences (an important work in this vein was Robert Coote and Keith Whitlam's ''The Emergence of Early Israel in Historical Perspective'', which used sociological data to argue, in contradiction to the biblical picture, that it was kingship that formed Israel, and not the other way round). 

Then in the 1990s a school of thought emerged from the background of the 1970s and 1980s which held that the entire enterprise of studying ancient Israel and its history was seriously flawed by an over-reliance on the biblical text, which was too problematic (meaning untrustworthy) to be used even selectively as a source for Israel's past, and that Israel itself was in any case itself a problematic subject. This movement came to be known as biblical minimalism.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=27-33}}

==Biblical minimalism==
The scholars that have come to be called "minimalists" are not a unified group, and in fact deny that they form a group or "school": Philip Davies points out that while he argues that the bulk of the Bible can be dated to the Persian period (the 5th century BCE), Niels Peter Lemche prefers the Hellenistic period (3rd to 2nd centuries BCE), while Whitelam has not given any opinion at all. Similarly, while Lemche holds that the [[Tel Dan stele]] (an inscription from the mid-9th century BCE which seems to mention the name of [[David]]) is probably a forgery, Davies and Whitelam do not. In short, the minimalists do not agree on much more than that the Bible is a doubtful source of information about ancient Israel.{{sfn|Davies|n.d.|}}

===Bible as a historical source document===
The first of the minimalists' two central claims is based on the premise that history-writing is never objective, but involves the selection of data and the construction of a narrative using preconceived ideas of the meaning of the past&amp;mdash;the fact that history is thus never neutral or objective raises questions about the accuracy of any historical account.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=33}} The minimalists cautioned that the literary form of the biblical history books is so apparent and the authors' intentions so obvious that scholars should be extremely cautious in taking them at face value. Even if the Bible does preserve some accurate information, researchers lack the means to sift that information from the inventions with which it may have been mixed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=34-35}} 

The minimalists did not claim that the Bible is useless as a historical source; rather, they suggest that its proper use is in understanding the period in which it was written, a period which some of them place in the Persian period (5th–4th centuries BCE) and others in the Hellenistic period (3rd–2nd centuries).{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=35}}

===Historicity of the nation of Israel===
The second claim is that "Israel" itself is a difficult idea to define in terms of historiography. There is, firstly, the idealised Israel which the Bible authors created&amp;mdash;"biblical Israel". In the words of Niels Peter Lemche: 
{{quote|''The Israelite nation as explained by the biblical writers has little in the way of a historical background. It is a highly ideological construct created by ancient scholars of Jewish tradition in order to legitimize their own religious community and its religio-political claims on land and religious exclusivity.''| {{Harvnb|Lemche|1998|pp=165–66}} }}
Modern scholars have taken aspects of biblical Israel and married them with data from archaeological and non-biblical sources to create their own version of a past Israel&amp;mdash;"Ancient Israel". Neither bears much relationship to the kingdom destroyed by Assyria in about 722 BCE&amp;mdash;"historical Israel". The real subjects for history-writing in the modern period are either this historical Israel or else the biblical Israel, the first a historical reality and the second an intellectual creation of the biblical authors. Linked with this was the observation that modern biblical scholars had concentrated their attentions exclusively on [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and their religious history, while ignoring the fact that these had been only a fairly insignificant part of a wider whole.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36}}

==Important works==
*''In Search of Ancient Israel'' (Philip R. Davies, 1992){{sfn|Davies|1995|p=}}
Davies' book "popularised the scholarly conversation and crystallised the import of the emerging scholarly positions" regarding the history of Israel between the 10th and 6th centuries—in other words, it summarised current research and thinking rather than proposing anything original. It was, nevertheless, a watershed work in that it drew together the new interpretations that were emerging from archaeology: the study of texts, sociology and anthropology. Davies argued that scholars needed to distinguish between the three meanings of the word Israel: the historical ancient kingdom of that name (historical Israel); the idealised Israel of the biblical authors writing in the Persian era and seeking to unify the post-exilic Jerusalem community by creating a common past (biblical Israel); and the Israel that had been created by modern scholars over the past century or so by blending together the first two (which he termed ancient Israel, in recognition of the widespread use of this phrase in scholarly histories). "Ancient Israel", he argued, was especially problematic: biblical scholars ran the risk of placing far too much confidence in their reconstructions through relying too heavily on "biblical Israel", the Bible's highly ideological version of a society that had already ceased to exist when the bulk of the biblical books reached their final form.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36, 291-292}}

*''The Invention of Ancient Israel'' (Keith Whitelam, 1996){{sfn|Whitelam|1996|p=}}
Subtitled "The Silencing of Palestinian History", Whitelam criticised his peers for their concentration on Israel and Judah to the exclusion of the many other peoples and kingdoms that had existed in Iron Age Palestine. Palestinian history for the period from 13th century BCE to the 2nd century CE had been ignored, and scholars had concentrated instead on political, social, and above all religious developments in the small entity of Israel. This, he argued, supported the contemporary claim to the land of Palestine by the descendants of Israel, while keeping biblical studies in the realm of religion rather than history.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=37}}

*''The Israelites in History and Tradition'' (Niels Peter Lemche, 1998){{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=}}

*''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' ([[Thomas L. Thompson]], 1999){{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=}}
The subtitle of the US edition of ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' was "Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel", a phrase almost guaranteed to cause controversy in America. The European title, ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past]]'', was perhaps more descriptive of its actual theme: the need to treat the Bible as literature rather than as history—"The Bible's language is not a historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction." This was Thompson's attempt to set the minimalist position before a wider public; it became the cause of a rejoinder by William Dever, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', which in turn led to a bitter public dispute between the two.

==Reception and influence==
The ideas of the minimalists generated considerable controversy during the 1990s and the early part of the 21st century. Some conservative scholars reacted defensively, attempting to show that the details of the Bible were in fact consistent with having been written by contemporaries (against the minimalist claim that they were largely the work of the Persian or Hellenistic periods). A notable work in this camp was Kenneth Kitchen's ''[[On the Reliability of the Old Testament]]''. Taking a different approach, ''[[A Biblical History of Israel]]'', by [[Iain Provan]], [[V. Philips Long]], and [[Tremper Longman III]], argued that criterion of distrust set by the minimalists (the Bible should be regarded as unreliable unless directly confirmed by external sources) was unreasonable, and that it should be regarded as reliable unless directly falsified. Avi Hurvitz compared biblical Hebrew with the Hebrew from ancient inscriptions and found it consistent with the period before the Persian period, thus questioning the key minimalist contention that the biblical books were written several centuries after the events they describe.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=38}} [[Takamitsu Muraoka]] also argues against the hypothesis that the entire Hebrew Bible was composed in the Persian period, associated with some minimalists like Davies, countering that there are specifically late Biblical Hebrew features, like some rare plene spellings, that are contained in books dated to the Persian era by minimalists as well, but unusual or absent elsewhere.{{sfn|Muraoka|2006|p=9, n. 2}}

In the scholarly mainstream a growing number see significant contradictions between the Bible's version of history and reality. Some who continue to take the Bible for their framework see it as having less reliability as the level of detail increases. In consequence, the study of Israel's past has now moved beyond the minimalist/maximalist debate. Historians of ancient Israel have adapted their methodologies by relying less on the Bible and more on sociological models and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39, 291}} Scholars such as [[Lester L. Grabbe]] (''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'', 2007), [[Victor H. Matthews]] (''Studying the Ancient Israelites: A Guide to Sources and Methods'', 2007), and Hans Barstad (''History and the Hebrew Bible'', 2008) simply put the evidence before the reader and explain the issues, rather than attempt to write histories; others such as K.L. Knoll (''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity'', 2001) attempt to include Israel in a broader treatment of Syria-Palestine/Canaan. This is not to say that the ideas of the minimalists are completely adopted in modern study of ancient Israel: Mario Liverani, for example (''Israel's History and the History of Israel'', 2005), accepts that the biblical sources are from the Persian period, but believes that the minimalists have not truly understood that context nor recognised the importance of the ancient sources used by the authors. Thus positions that do not fit either a minimalist or a maximalist position are now being expressed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39}}

[[File:altstetten.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Manesse]]: [[Konrad von Altstetten]].]]
The '''Bibliotheca Palatina''' ("[[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] library") of [[Heidelberg]] was the most important library of the [[German Renaissance]], numbering approximately 5,000 printed books and 3,524 manuscripts. The Bibliotheca was a prominent prize captured during the Thirty Years' War, taken as booty by [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]], and given to the Pope in a symbolic and political gesture.&lt;ref name=Bepler/&gt;&lt;ref name=HouseDivided/&gt; While some of the books and manuscripts are now held by the [[University of Heidelberg]], the bulk of the original collection is now an integral part of the [[Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] at the Vatican.

==Foundation==
In the 1430s, Elector [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]] founded the ''Stiftsbibliothek'' in the [[Heiliggeistkirche]], which had good light for reading. This library formed the core of the Palatine Collection established by Elector [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine|Ottheinrich]] in the 1550s, together with the [[University Library Heidelberg]]. Essential manuscripts from the original Bibliotheca Palatina include the Carolingian "[[Lorsch Evangelary]]", the ''Falkenbuch'' (''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', cpl 1071, commissioned by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]), and the [[Codex Manesse]] (cpg 848)

Further important manuscripts were acquired from the collection of [[Ulrich Fugger]] (d. 1584), notably the illustrated [[Sachsenspiegel]] (cpg 164). [[Joseph Scaliger]] considered this '''Fugger Library''' superior to that owned by the Pope; the manuscripts alone were valued at 80,000 crowns, a very considerable sum in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;The ''Classical Journal'' for March and June 1816, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thirty Years War==
The Palatinate suffered heavily in the [[Thirty Years War]], and in 1622 Heidelberg was sacked by the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], whose general [[Count von Tilly]] was in the employ of [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]]. As book plundering was a source of both Catholic and Protestant cultural triumph during the Thirty Year's War, the occupiers jostled for control of the library.&lt;ref name=HouseDivided/&gt;

Maximilian originally wanted to add the ''Bibiliotheca Palatina'' to his own library in Munich. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] also sought it, sending counter-instructions to Tilly to keep it for his own collection in Vienna.&lt;ref name=HouseDivided/&gt; Although many books were [[book burning|torn]] or "dispersed among private hands"&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; during the sack, Pope [[Gregory XV]] convinced Maximilian  to present the remaining manuscripts to the Vatican  as "a sign of his loyalty and esteem"&lt;ref&gt;''Luther: Lectures on Romans'', ed. by Wilhelm Pauck. Westminster John Knox
Press, 1961. {{ISBN|0-664-24151-4}}. Page xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; and to support his claim to the Palatinate's electoral title.&lt;ref name=HouseDivided&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Andrew L.|title=A House Divided: Wittelsbach Confessional Court Cultures in the Holy Roman Empire, C. 1550-1650|date=2010|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004183566|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations to secure transport the collection to Rome were supervised by the Greek scholar [[Leo Allatius]], sent to Heidelberg by the Vatican.

The Bibliotecha was a prominent prize captured during the Thirty Years' War. The victors were concerned not just with carrying away the collection and thus stripping the Calvinist party of one of its most important intellectual symbols; they also had wanted to eliminate all documentation of the library's provenance. The capture of the Palatine library was a carefully orchestrated symbolic act of looting in the Thirty Years' War, and triggered further acts of similar confiscations throughout the course of the hostilities.&lt;ref name=Bepler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bepler|first1=J|title=Vicissitudo Temporum: Some Sidelights on Book Collecting in the Thirty Years War|journal=Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=32|number=4|jstor=3648986|doi=10.2307/3648986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, as of 1623, the entire remaining library had been incorporated into the [[Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]], with each volume preserving, as a memorial, a leaf with the [[Wittelsbach]] arms.

By the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797), the Pope ceded 37 manuscripts to the [[French Republic]], which had them deposited in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]].  After the [[Vienna Congress|Congress of Vienna]] in 1814&amp;ndash;1815 decreed "the general restoration [or return] of works of art, of which the French had robbed other countries,"&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; the contested manuscripts were conveyed from Paris to Heidelberg, rather than to Rome.{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=Which contested MSs? Said most were in Vatican.}}  In 1816, [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Prince Hardenberg]] and [[Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg]] persuaded [[Pope Pius VII]] to make a gift of 852 manuscripts, mostly in German, to the [[University of Heidelberg]].

For the University Jubilee, some other books were temporarily brought back from the Vatican and were displayed at the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Heiliggeistkirche]] in  1986.

'''Bugchasing''', also known in slang as '''charging''', is the practice of pursuing [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] individuals in order to contract HIV. Individuals engaged in this activity are referred to as bugchasers. It is a form of [[self-harm]]. Bugchasers seek [[sexual partner]]s who are HIV-positive for the purpose of having [[Bareback (sex)|unprotected sex]] and becoming HIV-positive; '''giftgivers''' are HIV-positive individuals who comply with the bugchasers' efforts to become infected with HIV.

Bugchasers indicate various reasons for this activity. Some bugchasers engage in the activity for the excitement and intimacy inherent in pursuing such a dangerous activity, but do not implicitly desire to contract HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A.

Others have suggested that some people who feel lonely desire the nurturing community and social services that support people with [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt; It has also been used as a form of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frances, Richard J. |author2=Wikstrom, Thomas |author3=Alcena, Valiere | title=Contracting AIDS as a means of committing suicide| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1985|volume=142|issue=5|page=656| doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.656b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flavin, Daniel K. |author2=Franklin, John E. |author3=Frances, Richard J. | title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent homosexual men| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1440–1442| doi=10.1176/ajp.143.11.1440 | pmid=3777237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

By design, bug chasing involves [[unprotected sex]], but members of the [[Bareback (sex)|bareback]] subculture are not necessarily bugchasers. The difference is intent:

{{quote|text=In reviewing the scarce unpublished and published materials on bugchasing, as well as general healthcare speculations, a common theme appears — the lumping of bug chasers with barebackers.... Although these two groups share some of the same practices, namely unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), there are distinctions that differentiate bug chasing...even though all bug chasers are indeed barebackers, not all barebackers are bugchasers.&lt;ref name="pmid17612955"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Moskowitz DA, Roloff ME |title=The existence of a bug chasing subculture |journal=Cult Health Sex |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=347–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17612955 |doi=10.1080/13691050600976296 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/13691050600976296}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In simple terms, bugchasers engage in unprotected intercourse, and seek out partners with HIV, because they desire infection. Barebackers engage in unprotected intercourse because they prefer the sensation of it but generally prefer to avoid contracting STIs. While actual activity is the same for both groups the two do not share the same psychology. Barebackers conceptually have the same motivation as heterosexual couples that use non-barrier methods of birth control (more enjoyable sex), and, in contrast with bugchasers, do not deliberately seek HIV-infected partners.

As many "bugchasers" appear to be seeking the community and sympathy that HIV+ individuals experience, comparisons have been drawn with [[Munchausen syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Dr Mark|title=Contract Killing: A brief look at ‘bug chasing’|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201410/contract-killing|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Over the past decade, researchers have endeavored to document, explain, and look for a solution to bugchasing. Dr. DeAnn Gauthier and Dr. Craig Forsyth put forth the first academic article in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.Gauthier|first=Deann|last2=J.Forsyth|first2=Craig|date=1999-01-01|title=bareback sex, bug chasers, and the gift of death|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016396299266605|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=20|issue=1|pages=85–100|doi=10.1080/016396299266605|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; They explored the emerging trend of gay men who eschew [[condom]]s and the development of a barebacking subculture. They also noted through their qualitative research that some barebackers were in search of HIV.

Dr. Richard Tewksbury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewksbury|first=Richard|date=2003-09-01|title=bareback sex and the quest for HIV: assessing the relationship in internet personal advertisements of men who have sex with men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713840245|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=467–482|doi=10.1080/713840245|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first researchers to acknowledge bug chasing online and that bug chasers were using the [[Internet]] to assist their [[Seroconversion|seroconversive]] efforts. In his more recent research, he gave a strong analysis of what bug chasers and gift givers resemble in their behaviors, attitudes, and demographics.

Drs. Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bug Chasing and Gift Giving: The Potential for HIV Transmission Among Barebackers on the Internet|last1=Grov|first1=Christian|last2=Parsons|first2=Jeffrey T.|date=2006|doi=10.1521/aeap.2006.18.6.490|journal=AIDS Education and Prevention|volume=18|issue=6|pp=490–503|pmid=17166076}}&lt;/ref&gt; research using the internet profiles of 1,228 bug chasers and gift givers identified six subsets of bug chasers and gift givers.

# "The Committed Bug Chaser" included men who indicated they were HIV-negative and seeking HIV-positive partners. Of the committed bug chasers who indicated a desired sexual position, the majority were bottoms (62.2 percent [[anal sex|anal receptive]]). Only 7.5 percent of the sample were classified as committed bug chasers.
# "The Opportunistic Bug Chaser" included men who were HIV-negative and indicated that their partner’s HIV status did not matter. Most of these men were either versatile (43.6 percent; meaning [[anal receptive]] and [[anal insertive]]) or bottoms (46.3 percent). In total, 12.1 percent of their sample included opportunistic bug chasers.
# "The Committed Gift Giver" included men who were HIV-positive who also indicated they were seeking HIV-negative partners. Notably, only five men from the entire sample of 1,228 fell into this category.
# "The Opportunistic Gift Giver" included men who indicated they were HIV-positive and that their partner’s status did not matter to them. Most of these men (61.8 percent) were versatile. Opportunistic Gift Givers accounted for 26 percent of the sample.
# "The Serosorter" Although all men Drs Grov and Parsons sampled indicated they were a gift giver or a bug chaser in their [[User profile|Internet profile]], behavioural intentions did not consistently match with bug chaser/gift giver identity. Some HIV-positive men (8.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-positive men. Meanwhile, some HIV-negative men (12.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-negative men. Although having indicated they were a bug chaser or a gift giver, these men were [[serosorting]] for partners of similar HIV status.
# "The Ambiguous Bug Chaser or Gift Giver" included men who indicated they did not know their HIV status and thus it was difficult to determine if they were seeking to bug chase or gift give. This category was 16.3 percent of the sample.

In total, Drs Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons concluded that bug chasing and gift giving might occur among a select few individuals. Further, their research found that there was substantial variation in intentions to spread HIV (with some not intent on spreading HIV) among those who indicated they were gift givers or bug chasers.

Dr. David Moskowitz, Dr. Catriona MacLeod and Dr. Michael Roloff attempted to quantitatively explain why bug chasers chase HIV. They claimed that individuals who look for HIV are more likely [[sex addict]]s. These individuals have exhausted the sexual high they previously derived by performing other sexual risk taking behaviors, and now turn to bug chasing to achieve the risk-oriented high.

Dr. Bruce D. LeBlanc (2007) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Exploratory Study of  Bug Chasers|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20321517|journal=Sociological imagination|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1077-5048}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an exploratory study involving survey responses from self identified bug chasers, one of the first published studies involving direct responses from this identified group. His findings challenge "common sense" and research findings regarding bug chasers. Examining psychological and social motivations for seeking HIV the most frequent response was that individuals could not identify a psychological (internal thought process) or social (interactions with others) factor for seeking HIV. Regarding motivations for seeking infection the most frequent response was seeing becoming infected as a thrill, hot, or erotic, as well as seeing the semen through a similar lens.  Few respondents identified "getting it over with" as a motivating factor.

Some limited identification of becoming part of the "community" or "brotherhood" was identified.  Other variables studied included methods for finding partners, sexual behaviors undertaken while seeking infection, average number of sexual partners, length of time for which they will seek infection and life event changes if they were successful in becoming infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical response==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Bugchasing has, more recently, been taken more seriously by medical health promotion bodies, such as the [[Centers for Disease Control]], which hosted a workshop on the topic, hosted by Dr. Michael Graydon of [[Carleton University]], [[Ottawa]], at the 2004 National [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] Prevention Conference.

==In mainstream media==
The bugchasing/giftgiving phenomenon gained press coverage and notoriety after ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine printed an article in 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled "Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+".&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304003441/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|archivedate=2008-03-04|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|title=In Search of Death|author=Gregory A. Freeman|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 December 2009|date=23 January 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying that as many as 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Roeper&gt;{{Cite news| title = What makes bug chasers, gift givers do such a thing? | first = Richard | last = Roeper | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2003-04-22 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya&gt;{{Cite news| title = A new generation rethinks AIDS risk | page = 1D |department=Island Life | newspaper = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 2003-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but ''Rolling Stone'' stands behind the story.&lt;ref name = Roeper/&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = n TRANSMISSION |journal= AIDS Policy and Law |volume= 18 |issue= 4 | date = 2003-03-03 | publisher = LRP Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mnookin&gt;{{Cite news| title = Using 'Bug Chasers' | page = 10 | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | publisher = Newsweek | date = 2003-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's [[Fenway Health|Fenway Community Health]], was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bugged&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bugged Out Over AIDS Story | page = 10 | publisher = New York Post | date = 2003-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the statements "entirely a fabrication," but ''Rolling Stone'' also stood behind them.&lt;ref name = Bugged/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated? | newspaper = Newsweek | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | date = 2003-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weinstein, then editor of the ''New York Blade'', an established gay newspaper, called the article "less than truthful" and attributed it to a ''Rolling Stone'' editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing "lad mag" who wished to make a sensation for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = Steve | title = Chasing the bug chasers [editorial] | journal = Washington Blade | date = May 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the article, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] put out an action alert, calling its members to "PROTEST ROLLING STONE'S IRRESPONSIBLE 'BUG CHASING'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Savage Love |department=Hot Spot | page = 171 | authorlink = Dan Savage | first = Dan | last = Savage | newspaper = The Village Voice | date = 2003-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics criticized the use of the disputed figures by conservative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Men Who Want AIDS | first = Matthew | last = Laza | pages = 21–24 | newspaper = The Spectator | date = 2003-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, The Traditional Values Coalition used the article to urge the [[Centers for Disease Control]] to cut down on its AIDS funding.&lt;ref name = Mnookin/&gt;

Writer/[[film director|director]] Daniel Bort made a [[2003 in film|2003]] short film  on the subject called ''Bugchaser'', which premièred at the 16th Annual [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and was shot mainly in [[New York City|New York]] [[sex club]]s. In an interview with the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', he explained: ''"The matter-of-fact declarations of a string of articulate, apparently nonsensical people...affected me tremendously. I had to find out the reasons why such individuals will seek suicide in this almost symbolic way."'' At the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the film was shown with an accompanying [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Gift (2003 film)|The Gift]]'' by Louise Hogarth.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

HIV-positive male Ricky Dyer, who investigated the apparent bug chasing phenomenon for a 2006 [[BBC]] programme, ''I love being HIV+'', said that an air of complacency about the realities of living with the virus may be one reason why infection rates have been rising.&lt;ref name="HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4895012.stm|title=HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? |accessdate=2008-07-06|publisher=BBC News|author=Richard Pendry   | date=2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC also described bugchasing as more internet fantasy than reality, saying that, "Dyer finds that the overwhelming majority of the talk is pure fantasy." The article also quotes Will Nutland, head of health promotion at Terrence Higgins Trust, as saying, "The concepts of 'gift giving' and 'bug chasers' are definitely based more in fantasy than reality" as well as Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, who said, "There is very little evidence of people trying to get infected with HIV."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' a former student of Professor Ben Bruckner asked Ben to infect him with HIV, wanting to experience "the gift". Ben refuses and writes a short story about the incident.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the NBC series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', Season 7, Episode 13, Dr. Malucci treats a gay man who wants to contract HIV from his positive partner. Malucci asked the HIV-negative patient if he is "bug chasing".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On his 2003 EP HRG, Vol. 1, singer/songwriter [[Marc with a C]] has a song on the subject entitled "Chasing the Bug".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">The '''Center of Molecular Immunology''' ('''Centro de Inmunología Molecular''') or '''CIM''', is a [[cancer]] research institution located on the west side of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. {{Coord|23.0755|-82.4708}} Opened on December 5, 1994, it focuses on the research and production of new [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the treatment of cancer and other nontransmissible diseases.

==Facilities==
The design and construction of the Center of Molecular Immunology  was modeled on current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] guidelines recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] and adopted by Cuba, particularly those also adopted by the member countries of the European Union, then known as the European Community.

Research labs, production areas and administrative offices share the 15,000 square meters of the two floor facility.

Approximately 800 employees work at the CIM, most of them scientists and engineers. These personnel are administratively organized in three main areas: Research and Development, Production, and Quality Assurance.

==Research==
Basic research projects are focused on [[cancer immunotherapy]], especially the development of molecular vaccines. These include [[antibody]] engineering, cellular engineering, [[bioinformatics]] and regulation of the [[immune response]].

CIM conducts clinical trials in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy of varying origin, as well as other immune system diseases, in highly specialized hospitals.

In August 2011 it was announced that the Center of Molecular Immunology released [[CimaVax-EGF]], the first therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]] for [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-09/cuba-releases-worlds-first-lung-cancer-vaccine|title=Cuba Announces Release of the World's First Lung Cancer Vaccine|publisher=PopSci|date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, a new therapeutic cancer vaccine was approved by Cuban regulatory agency. CIMAbid (racotumomab or 1E10)obtained conditional approval for the treatment of lung cancer. This vaccine is an antiidiotypic vaccine targeting N-glicolil GM3, a tumor specific antigen. The project leader was Dr Ana María Vazquez. These vaccine has been associated with statistically significant extension of survival of lung cancer patients  with excellent safety profile and continues to be investigated in confirmatory clinical trials. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Products==

Today CIM produces biopharmaceutical products, such as anti-CD3 [[monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of patients with organ [[transplant rejection]], human recombinant [[erythropoietin]] for the treatment of [[anemia]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] for the treatment of [[neutropenia]], and a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor for cancer treatment, as well as other monoclonal antibodies for [[tumor]] imaging.

==Commercialization==

Since 1992 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] has been devoted to the commercialization of [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the [[Cuba]]n market and abroad, especially [[monoclonal antibodies]] and other recombinant proteins for the diagnosis and treatment of [[cancer]] and other diseases related to the [[immune system]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] is the exclusive representative for the commercialization of the products and services of the Center of Molecular Immunology.

It was announced in July 2008 that CIM had also received approval from the Cuban regulatory authorities for a lung cancer vaccine, targeting EGFR.  The vaccine has been in development since 1992 and the project led by Gisela Gonzalez.

The '''Centre for Cross-Cultural Research on Women''' ('''CCCRW''') was established to advance research on women internationally. Prior to the centre being officially created seminars were started in 1972 by academic women (mainly anthropologists) presenting research on women and in particular the universal inferior status of women. This was at the time when the feminist movement was active and the seminars attracted large audiences in what was still male dominated Oxford. It was felt that anthropologists were not looking at research questions such as the place and role of women in society as well as the feminist issues raised from those questions. The centre gave opportunity and space for women researchers to present their findings in public. These seminars have continued weekly every term since 1972 as detailed below. From presenting early papers at the Centre many of the participants have gone onto senior posts in academia and beyond. The founding Director of CCCRW was [[Shirley Ardener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Women|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/cross-cultural-perspectives-on-women/|website=www.bloomsbury.com|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 the CCCRW was formally established at Queen Elizabeth House, the University of Oxford’s International Development Centre. QEH had been the venue for most of the seminars from 1972. Members felt that a public event should mark the beginning of the newly formed Centre and in 1984 the first Commemorative Lecture in celebration of pioneering women anthropologists was given. This was in honour of [[Phyllis Kaberry]] with two other women anthropologists, [[Barbara Ward]] and [[Audrey Richards]], also being commemorated. Details of the lectures from 1984 are given below.

Visiting Fellows formed an important part of the Centre’s programme since its inception. Fellows had their own research plans and follow individualised research or study programmes, with appointed facilitators according to their research needs. They attended seminars, lectures and workshops, and these provide useful opportunities for cross-cultural exchange of research ideas. Fellows were fully integrated into the social activities of the Centre and QEH more generally. They visited the Centre for up to one academic year or for as little as a month, depending on available funding and research time. Issues researched broadly concern with gender, culture and development. The Centre has had over 100 Visiting Fellows. 

Also included in its activities are workshops and conferences, which resulted in many publications (there was a monograph series first with [[Berg Publishers|Berg]] then [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/browse/bysubject/gender-studies Berghahn Books]). The topics discussed in seminars since its beginning is very varied  with relevance to everyday life in many countries and cultures.

In 2002 the name was changed to the [[International Gender Studies Centre]]. [http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/igs The IGS website summarises much of this history] but never mentions the former name.

In July 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2017-02/NEWSLETTER--OCT-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, IGS/CCCRW ended its long association with Queen Elizabeth House and moved to [[Lady Margaret Hall]] (LMH).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4244">'''The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study''' (CHARLS) is a [[longitudinal survey]] being conducted by the [[China Center for Economic Research]] at [[Peking University]] with Professor Yaohui Zhao of Peking University serving as [[Principal Investigator]] and Professors [https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/econ/econ_faculty_display.cfm?Person_ID=1003738 John Strauss] of the [[University of Southern California]] and Albert Park of [[HKUST Institute for Emerging Market Studies]] serving as co-Principal Investigators.

== Goals ==

The survey will collect a [[representative sample]] of Chinese 45 and older every two years to enable [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary studies]] on issues related to [[population ageing]]. China is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world and accounts for a large fraction of the growth in the world’s old. By 2050, China’s elderly (65 and older) population share is expected to reach 30%.&lt;ref name="RAND_WR774"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Outcomes and Socio-Economic Status Among the Elderly in China - Evidence from the CHARLS Pilot|url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/working_papers/2010/RAND_WR774.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

The pilot survey is funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]], the [[World Bank]], and [[Natural Science Foundation of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Institute of Aging - CHARLS Related Funding Grants|url=https://taggs.hhs.gov/RecipInfo.cfm?SELEIN=LCYqIy8%2FLEZNQkxPXFFaOEsK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==

The questionnaire contains information on household [[demographics]], transfers among family members, health status, health care, employment, income, consumption and [[assets]], as well as information on health facilities of the community and government policies in local areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHARLS Pilot Questionnaire|url=http://charls.ccer.edu.cn/charls/content.asp?id=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CHARLS is designed on the models of health and retirement studies originated from the [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS) in the U.S., but has the advantage of including information on the community the respondent resides and local policies. Due to large internal variations of government policies, the data will enable analyses of policy impacts in the process of population ageing. Other countries participating in this international network of ageing studies include [[England]], fifteen countries in continental [[Europe]], [[Israel]], [[India]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]].

=== Initial Results ===

The pilot survey was conducted in two provinces ([[Zhejiang]] and [[Gansu]]) in 2008 and collected data on roughly 1,600 households.&lt;ref name="RAND_WR774" /&gt; The pilot data of 2008 has been released to the research community since April 30, 2009. The national baseline survey is being planned for 2011. CHARLS data will be available for download by researchers at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Institute of Ageing Longitudinal Database Search|url=http://www.nia.nih.gov/ResearchInformation/ScientificResources/LongitudinalStudiesAllCurrent.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese architecture''' demonstrates an [[architectural style]] that developed over millennia in [[China]], before spreading out to influence architecture all throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]]. Since the solidification of the style in the early [[Imperial China|imperial period]], the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Starting with the [[Tang Dynasty]], Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]], and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Northeast and [[Southeast Asia]]. Chinese architecture is typified by various features; such as, bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, the incorporation of ideas related to [[feng shui]] such as directional hierarchies, a horizontal emphasis, and the allusion to various cosmological, mythological, or other symbolism. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces. In part because of an emphasis on the use of wood, a relatively perishable material, and due to a de-emphasis on major monumental structures built of less-organic but more durable materials, much of the historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published planning diagrams and specifications. Some of the architecture of China shows the influence of other types or styles from outside of China, such as the influences on [[mosque]] structures originating in the [[Middle East]]. Chinese architecture has also influenced neighboring areas, including Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia. Although displaying certain unifying aspects, rather than being completely homogeneous, Chinese architecture has many types of variation based on status or affiliation, such as dependence on whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or used for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in the varying styles associated with different geographic regions and in ethnic architectural design. 

{{quote|The architecture of China is as old as Chinese civilization. From every source of information—literary, graphic, exemplary—there is strong evidence testifying to the fact that the Chinese have always enjoyed an indigenous system of construction that has retained its principal characteristics from prehistoric times to the present day. Over the vast area from Chinese Turkistan to Japan, from Manchuria to the northern half of French Indochina, the same system of construction is prevalent; and this was the area of Chinese cultural influence. That this system of construction could perpetuate itself for more than four thousand years over such a vast territory and still remain a living architecture, retaining its principal characteristics in spite of repeated foreign invasions—military, intellectual, and spiritual—is a phenomenon comparable only to the continuity of the civilization of which it is an integral part.|[[Liang Sicheng]]|1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Liang Sicheng]], year 12, ''A pictorial history of Chinese architecture : a study of the development of its structural system and the evolution of its types'', ed. by Wilma Fairbank, Cambridge (Mass.): [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the 20th Century, Western-trained Chinese architects have attempted to combine traditional Chinese designs into [[modern architecture]] (usually government), with great success. Moreover, the pressure for urban development throughout contemporary [[China]] required higher speed of construction and higher [[floor area ratio]], which means that in the great cities the demand for traditional Chinese buildings, which are normally less than 3 levels, has declined in favor of modern architecture. However, the traditional skills of Chinese architecture, including [[carpentry|major and minor carpentry]], [[masonry]], and [[stonemasonry]], are still applied to the construction of [[vernacular architecture]] in the vast rural area in China.

==History==
===Neolithic &amp; early Antiquity===
Chinese civilizational cultures developed in the plains along the numerous rivers that emptied into the [[Bohai Bay|Bohai]] and [[Honzhow Bay|Hongzhow]] bays. The mosr prominent of these rivers, the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and the [[Yangtze]], hosted a complex fabric of villages. The climate was warmer and more humid that today, allowing for millet to be grown in the north and rice in the south. There was, however, no single "origin" of the Chinese civilization.

==Features==

The rectangular compound shown above has two sections of courtyards. The buildings on the axle line include central entrance, four-pointed pavilion, mountain-shaped front hall, artificial mountain and ponds, eight-pointed pavilion and mountain-shaped retiring quarters. The two sides of the central axle are arranged with corridor rooms symmetrically.]]

===Architectural bilateral symmetry===

A very important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[articulation (architecture)|articulation]] and bilateral symmetry, which signifies balance. Bilateral symmetry and the articulation of buildings are found everywhere in Chinese architecture, from palace complexes to humble farmhouses. When possible, plans for renovation and extension of a house will often try to maintain this symmetry provided that there is enough capital to do so.&lt;ref name=KnappEA&gt;{{Citation| first = Ronald G. |last= Knapp |year=2006 |title=Chinese Houses: The Architectural Heritage of a Nation |publisher=Tuttle Publishing | isbn=978-0-8048-3537-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary elements are positioned either side of main structures as two wings to maintain overall bilateral symmetry. The buildings are typically planned to contain an even number of columns in a structure to produce an odd number of bays (間). With the inclusion of a main door to a building in the center bay, symmetry is maintained.

In contrast to the buildings,  the Chinese gardens tend to be asymmetrical. The principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ming Furniture in the Light of Chinese Architecture |first=Sarah |last=Handler |publisher=Ten Speed Press |date=January 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the classic Chinese garden is based on the ideology of "Nature and Man in One", as opposed to the home itself, which is a symbol of the human sphere co-existing with, but separate from nature. So, the arrangement is as flexible as possible to let people feel they are surrounded by and in harmony with nature. The two essential elements of the garden are hill stones and water. The hill stones mean the pursuit of immortality and water represents emptiness and existence. The mountain belongs to yang (static beauty) and the water belongs to yin (dynamic wonder). They depend on each other and complete the whole nature. &lt;ref&gt; Cui, Huaizu, and Qingqing Hu (2015), ''Creation and Appreciation of “Nature and Man in One” and Chinese Classic Beauty of Garden – Taking the Suzhou classic garden as an example'', (https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2015/04/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001.html). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Enclosure===

In much of traditional Chinese architecture, buildings or building complexes take up an entire property but enclose open spaces within themselves. These enclosed spaces come in two forms, the:&lt;ref name="KnappEA"/&gt;
*''Courtyard (院)'': The use of open courtyards is a common feature in many types of Chinese architectures. This is best exemplified in the [[Siheyuan]], which has consisted of an empty space surrounded by buildings connected with one another either directly or through verandas.
*''"Sky well" (天井)'': Although large open courtyards are less commonly found in southern Chinese architecture, the concept of an "open space" surrounded by buildings, which is seen in northern courtyard complexes, can be seen in the southern building structure known as the "sky well". This structure is essentially a relatively enclosed courtyard formed from the intersections of closely spaced buildings and offer small opening to the sky through the roof space from the floor up.

These enclosures serve in temperature regulation and in venting the building complexes. Northern courtyards are typically open and facing the south to allow the maximum exposure of the building windows and walls to the sun while keeping the cold northern winds out. Southern sky wells are relatively small and serves to collect rain water from the roof tops. They perform the same duties as the [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]] [[impluvium]] while restricting the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Sky wells also serve as vents for rising hot air, which draws cool air from the lower stories of the house and allows for exchange of cool air with the outside.

===Hierarchy===
[[File:Tomb of Northern Qi Dynasty in Jiuyuangang, Xinzhou, Mural, Building.jpg|thumb|A tomb mural of [[Xinzhou]], dated to the [[Northern Qi]] (550-577 AD) period, showing a hall with a [[Roof tiles|tiled roof]], [[dougong]] brackets, and doors with giant [[door knockers]] (perhaps made of bronze)]]
The projected hierarchy and importance and uses of buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are based on the strict placement of buildings in a property/complex. Buildings with doors facing the front of the property are considered more important than those facing the sides. Buildings facing away from the front of the property are the least important.

South-facing buildings in the rear and more private location of the property with higher exposure to sunlight are held in higher esteem and reserved for elder members of the family or ancestral plaques. Buildings facing east and west are generally for junior members or branches of the family, while buildings near the front are typically for servants and hired help.&lt;ref name=zggjz&gt;{{citation |title=中国古建筑 |publisher=齊魯音像出版社出版发行 |last=浙江长城纪实文化传播公司 |year=2004 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/zhongguo-gu-jian-zhu/oclc/057661389 |isbn=978-7-88408-237-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Front-facing buildings in the back of properties are used particularly for rooms of celebratory rites and for the placement of ancestral halls and plaques. In multiple courtyard complexes, central courtyards and their buildings are considered more important than peripheral ones, the latter typically being used as storage or servants’ rooms or kitchens.&lt;ref name=KnappEA/&gt;

=== Horizontal emphasis ===
Classical Chinese buildings, especially those of the wealthy, are built with an emphasis on breadth and less on height, featuring an enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not well emphasized. Buildings that were too high and large were considered unsightly, and therefore generally avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Li |first = Yih-yuan |title = Ancestors |publisher = DE GRUYTER MOUTON |ISBN = 9783110805314 |doi = 10.1515/9783110805314.329 |chapter = Chinese Geomancy and Ancestor Worship: A Further Discussion |year = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings, using sheer scale to inspire awe in visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date = 2017-01-31 |work = Traditional Chinese Architecture |publisher = Princeton University Press |ISBN = 9781400885138 |doi = 10.1515/9781400885138-018 |chapter = Twelve. Typical Design Features of Ming Palaces and Altars in Beijing |title = Traditional Chinese Architecture }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preference contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. This often meant that [[Pagoda|pagodas]] towered above all other buildings in the skyline of a Chinese city.&lt;ref name="Kohrman"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kohrman |first = Matthew |date = March 1998 |title = Technology and Gender: Fabrics of Power in Late Imperial China:Technology and Gender: Fabrics of Power in Late Imperial China |journal = American Anthropologist |volume = 100 |issue = 1 |page = 236 |doi = 10.1525/aa.1998.100.1.236.1 |ISSN = 0002-7294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halls and palaces in the [[Forbidden City]] (which were in fact partially designed with some western influence),  have rather low ceilings when compared to equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their external appearances suggest the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have found their way into modern Western architecture, for example through the work of [[Jørn Utzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Richard |last = Weston |title = Utzon |publisher = Edition Blondal |year = 2002 |ISBN = 978-87-88978-98-8 |page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmological concepts ===
[[File:Siheyuan model.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Model of a Chinese [[Siheyuan]] in Beijing, which shows off the symmetry, enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized.]]

Chinese architecture from early times used concepts from [[Wu Xing|Chinese cosmology]] such as ''[[feng shui]]'' ([[geomancy]]) and [[Taoism]] to organize construction and layout from common residences to imperial and religious structures.&lt;ref name="KnappEA" /&gt; This includes the use of:
* Screen walls to face the main entrance of the house, which stems from the belief that evil things travel in straight lines.
* Talismans and imagery of good fortune:
** [[Door god]]s displayed on doorways to ward off evil and encourage the flow of good fortune
** Three anthropomorphic figures representing [[Fu Lu Shou]] (福祿壽 fú-lù-shòu) stars are prominently displayed, sometimes with the proclamation "the three stars are present" (三星宅 sān-xīng-zhài)
** Animals and fruits that symbolize good fortune and prosperity, such as [[bat]]s and [[pomegranates]], respectively. The association is often done through [[rebus]]es.
* Orienting the structure with its back to elevated landscape and ensuring that there is water in the front. Considerations are also made such that the generally windowless back of the structure faces the north, where the wind is coldest in the winter.
* Ponds, pools, wells, and other water sources are usually built into the structure.
* Aligning a building along a north/south axis, with the building facing south and the two sides facing east and west respectively.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt;

The use of certain colors, numbers and the cardinal directions in traditional Chinese architecture reflected the belief in a type of [[immanence]], where the nature of a thing could be wholly contained in its own form. Although the Western tradition gradually developed a body of architectural literature, little was written on the subject in China, and the earliest text, the [[Kaogongji]], was never disputed. However, ideas about cosmic harmony and the order of the city were usually interpreted at their most basic level, so a reproduction of the "ideal" city never existed. [[Beijing]] as reconstructed throughout the 15th and 16th century remains one of the best examples of traditional Chinese [[town planning]].

==Architectural types==
There are various types of Chinese architecture. Some of these relate to the associated use of the structures, such as whether they were built for royals, commoners, or the religious.

=== Commoners ===
Due to primarily wooden construction and poor maintenance, far fewer examples of commoner's homes survive to this day compared to those of nobles. According to Matthew Korman, the average commoner's home did not change much, even centuries after the establishment of the universal style, such as early 20th century homes, were very similar to late and mid imperial homes in layout and construction.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt;

These homes, be they those of bureaucrats, merchants or farmers, tended to follow a set pattern: the center of the building would be a shrine for the deities and the ancestors, which would also be used during festivities. On its two sides were bedrooms for the elders; the two wings of the building (known as "guardian dragons" by the Chinese) were for the junior members of the family, as well as the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen, although sometimes the living room could be very close to the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Beijing Courtyard House |last=Cassault |first=Andre |publisher=Open House International |year=1987 |ISBN = |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sometimes the extended families became so large that one or even two extra pairs of "wings" had to be built. This resulted in a U-shaped building, with a courtyard suitable for farm work.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt; Merchants and bureaucrats, however, preferred to close off the front with an imposing front gate. All buildings were legally regulated, and the law held that the number of stories, the length of the building and the colours used depended on the owner's class.

Some commoners living in areas plagued by bandits built communal fortresses called [[Tulou]] for protection. Often favoured by the Hakka in Fujian and Jiangxi, the design of Tulou also shows the Chinese ancient philosophy of harmony between people and environment. People used local materials to build the walls with rammed earth. There is no window to the outside on the lower two floors for defense, but it’s open on the inside with a common courtyard and lets people get together easily.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Shao-Sen; Li, Su-Yu; and Shi-Jie Liao (2012). ''The Genes of Tulou: A Study on the Preservation and Sustainable Development of Tulou'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/12/3377/htm). Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial===
There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the [[Emperor of China]]. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles, yellow having been the Imperial color; yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s ("''dougong''"), a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surfaces of the walls, tend to be red in color. Black is also a famous color often used in pagodas. It was believed that the gods are inspired by the black color to descend to the earth.

The Chinese 5-clawed dragon, adopted by the first Ming emperor for his personal use, was used as decoration on the beams, pillars, and on the doors on Imperial architecture. Curiously, the dragon was never used on roofs of imperial buildings.

Only the buildings used by the imperial family were allowed to have nine ''jian'' (間, space between two columns); only the gates used by the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] could have five arches, with the centre one, of course, being reserved for the Emperor himself. The ancient Chinese favored the color [[red]]. The buildings faced south because the north had a cold wind.

[[Beijing]] became the [[capital of China]] after the [[Mongol]] invasion of the 13th century, completing the easterly migration of the Chinese capital begun since the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] dynasty. The [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] uprising in 1368 reasserted Chinese authority and fixed Beijing as the seat of imperial power for the next five centuries. The Emperor and the Empress lived in palaces on the central axis of the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Crown Prince]] at the eastern side, and the concubines at the back (therefore the numerous imperial concubines were often referred to as "The Back Palace Three Thousand"). However, during the mid-[[Qing Dynasty]], the Emperor's residence was moved to the western side of the complex. It is misleading to speak of an axis in the Western sense of a visual [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] ordering facades, rather the Chinese axis is a line of privilege, usually built upon, regulating access—there are no vistas, but a series of gates and pavilions.

[[Numerology]] heavily influenced Imperial Architecture, hence the use of nine in much of construction (nine being the greatest single digit number) and the reason why the Forbidden City in Beijing is said to have 9,999.9 rooms—just short of the mythical 10,000 rooms in heaven. The importance of the East (the direction of the rising sun) in orienting and siting Imperial buildings is a form of solar worship found in many ancient cultures, where there is the notion of Ruler being affiliated with the Sun.

The tombs and mausoleums of imperial family members, such as the 8th century [[Tang Dynasty]] tombs at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], can also be counted as part of the imperial tradition in architecture. These above-ground earthen mounds and pyramids had subterranean shaft-and-vault structures that were lined with brick walls since at least the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC).&lt;ref name="guo 2004 12"&gt;Guo, Qinghua.

Generally speaking, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] architecture follows the imperial style. A large Buddhist monastery normally has a front hall, housing the statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]], followed by a great hall, housing the statues of the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]]. Accommodations for the monks and the nuns are located at the two sides. Some of the greatest examples of this come from the 18th century [[Puning Temple (Hebei)|Puning Temple]] and [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple]]. Buddhist monasteries sometimes also have [[pagoda]]s, which may house the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha]]; older pagodas tend to be four-sided, while later pagodas usually have eight sides.

[[Daoism|Daoist]] architecture, on the other hand, usually follows the commoners' style. The main entrance is, however, usually at the side, out of [[superstition]] about [[demon]]s which might try to enter the premise (see [[feng shui]].) In contrast to the Buddhists, in a [[Daoism|Daoist]] temple the main deity is located in the main hall at the front, the lesser deities in the back hall and at the sides. This is because Chinese people believe that even after the body has died, the soul is still alive. From the Han grave design, it shows the forces of cosmic yin and yang, the two forces from the heaven and earth that creates eternity. &lt;ref&gt; Suhadolnik, Nataša Vampelj (2011).

The tallest pre-modern building in China was built for both religious and martial purposes. The [[Liaodi Pagoda]] of 1055 AD stands at a height of {{convert|84|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and although it served as the crowning pagoda of the Kaiyuan monastery in old Dingzhou, [[Hebei]], it was also used as a military [[watchtower]] for [[Song Dynasty]] soldiers to observe potential [[Liao Dynasty]] enemy movements.

The architecture of the [[List of mosques in China|mosques]] and ''[[Gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'' tomb shrines of [[Islam in China|China's Muslims]] often combines traditional Chinese styles with Middle Eastern influences.

==Urban planning==
{{Main|Ancient Chinese urban planning}}
Chinese urban planning is based on [[fengshui]] geomancy and the [[well-field]] system of land division, both used since the Neolithic age. The basic [[well-field]] diagram is overlaid with the luoshu, a [[magic square]] divided into 9 sub-squares, and linked with Chinese numerology.&lt;ref&gt;Schinz, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  In Southern Song Dynasty (1131AD), the design of Hongcun city in Anhui was based around "harmony between man and nature", facing south and surrounded by mountains and water. According to the theory of the traditional Chinese fengshui geomancy, it is a carefully planned ancient village and show the Human-Nature Intergraded Ecological Planning concept. &lt;ref&gt; Zheng, Shanwen; Han, Baolong; Wang, Dang; and Zhiyun Ouyang (2018). ''Ecological Wisdom and Inspiration Underlying the Planning and Construction of Ancient Human Settlements: Case Study of Hongcun UNESCO World Heritage Site in China'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/5/1345). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;

Since wars happened in northern China very often, people moved to southern China. The building method of a courtyard house was adapted to southern China. The village of Tungyuan in Fujian Province is a good example of a planned settlement that shows the Chinese feng shui elements - psychological self-defense and building structure – in the form of material self-defense. &lt;ref&gt; Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015). ''Architectural Features and Preservation of Ancient Residential Complexes of the Changs in Xiangan, Xiamen'', page 455 (https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W7/453/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-453-2015.pdf).

==Construction==

===Materials and history===
[[File:Earthenware architecture models, Eastern Han Dynasty, 3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Models of watchtowers and other buildings made during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (AD 25–220); while these models were made of ceramics, the real versions were made of easily perishable wood and have not survived.]]
Wood was originally utilised as a primary building material because it was very common. Also, Chinese people trust that life is connecting with nature and humans should interact with animated things, therefore wood was favored as opposed to stone, which was associated with the homes of the dead.&lt;ref&gt; Li, Lin; Tang, Lei; Zhu, Haihong; Zhang, Hang; Yang, Fan; and Wenmin Qin (2017). ''Semantic 3D Modeling Based on CityGML for Ancient Chinese-Style Architectural Roofs of Digital Heritage'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/5/132/htm). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike other building construction materials, old wooden structures often do not survive because they are more vulnerable to weathering and fires and are naturally subjected to rotting over time. Although now-nonexistent wooden residential towers, watchtowers, and pagodas predated it by centuries, the [[Songyue Pagoda]] built in 523 is the oldest extant [[Chinese pagoda|pagoda in China]]; its use of [[brick]] instead of wood had much to do with its endurance throughout the centuries. From the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) onwards, brick and stone architecture gradually became more common and replaced wooden edifices. The earliest examples of this transition can be seen in building projects such as the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] completed in 605 or the [[Xumi Pagoda]] built in 636, yet stone and brick architecture is known to have been used in subterranean tomb architecture of earlier dynasties.

The earliest walls and platforms in China were of [[rammed earth]] construction, and over time brick and stone became more frequently used. This can be seen in ancient sections of the [[Great Wall of China]], while the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a renovation of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).

*''Foundations'': Most buildings are typically erected on raised platforms (臺基) as their foundations. Vertical structural beams may rest on raised stone pedestals (柱础) which occasionally rest on [[Deep foundation|piles]]. In lower class construction, the platforms are constructed of rammed [[earth]] platforms that are unpaved or paved with brick or ceramics. In the simplest cases vertical structural beams are driven into the ground directly. Upper class constructions typically have high raised stone paved rammed earth or stone foundations with ornately carved heavy stone pedestals for supporting large vertical structural beams.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; The vertical beams rest and remain on their pedestals solely by friction and the pressure exerted by the building structure.&lt;ref name=yu&gt;{{citation |first=Maohong |last=YU |first2=Yoshiya |last2=ODA |first3=Dongping |last3=FANG |first4=Junhai |last4=ZHAO |title=Advances in structural mechanics of Chinese ancient architectures |journal=Front.

*''Structural beams'': Use of large structural timbers for primary support of the roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position.
*''Structural connections'': Timber frames are typically constructed with joinery and dowelling alone, seldom with the use of glue or nails. These types of semi-rigid structural joints allow the timber structure to resist bending and torsion while under high compression.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Structural stability is further ensured through the use of heavy beams and roofs, which weighs the structure down.&lt;ref name=yu /&gt; The lack of glue or nails in joinery, the use of non-rigid support such as [[dougong]], and the used of wood as structural members allow the buildings to slide, flex, and hinge while absorbing shock, vibration, and groundshift from [[earthquake]]s without significant damage to its structure.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Dougong has a special function. The rich people applied valuable materials to decorate the Dougong for displaying their wealth. The common people used artwork to express their appreciation to the house. &lt;ref&gt; Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015). ''Architectural Features and Preservation of Ancient Residential Complexes of the Changs in Xiangan, Xiamen'', page 458 (https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W7/453/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-453-2015.pdf). Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;
*''Walls'': The common use of curtain walls or door panels to delineate rooms or enclose a building, with the general de-emphasis of [[load-bearing wall]]s in most higher class construction. However, with the reduction in availability of trees in the later dynasties for building structures, the use of load-bearing walls in non-governmental or religious construction increased, with brick and stone being commonly used.
*''Roofs'': Flat roofs are uncommon while [[gable]]d roofs are almost omnipresent in traditional Chinese architecture. Roofs are either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, roof supporting beams are supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect them to the primary structural beams.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Three main types of roofs are found:
*#''Straight inclined'': Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical type of roofing and are most prevalent in commoner architectures.
*#''Multi-inclined'': Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions, from the dwellings of wealthy commoners to palaces.
*#''Sweeping'': Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof. This type of roof construction is usually reserved for temples and palaces although it may also be found in the homes of the wealthy. In the former cases, the ridges of the roof are usually highly decorated with ceramic figurines.
*''Roof apex'': The roof apex of a large hall is usually topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for both decorative purposes as well as to weigh down the layers of roofing tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions of China, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form matouqiang (horse-head walls), which serve as a fire deterrent from drifting embers.
*''Roof top decorations'': Symbolism can be found from colors of the eaves, roofing materials and roof top decorations. Gold/yellow is an auspicious (good) color, imperial roofs are gold or yellow. They are usually used by the emperor. Green roofs symbolize bamboo shafts, which, in turn, represent youth and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/10/content_46273.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628081026/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/10/content_46273.htm |archivedate=28 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mostly only ruins of [[brick]] and [[rammed earth]] walls and towers from ancient China (i.e. before the 6th century AD) have survived, information on ancient Chinese architecture (especially wooden architecture) can be discerned from more or less realistic clay [[Scale model|models of buildings]] created by the ancient Chinese as funerary items. This is similar to the paper [[joss paper|joss]] houses burned in some modern Chinese funerals. The following models were made during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 220):

During the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]] and the [[Six Dynasties]], miniature models of buildings or entire architectural ensembles were often made to decorate the tops of the so-called "soul vases" (''[[hunping]]''), found in many tombs of that period.&lt;ref name=dien&gt;{{citation

== Influence from outside of China ==
Despite largely being self-developing, there have been periods where Chinese architecture received significant influence from abroad, particularly during conquest dynasties such as the Yuan and Qing, who tended to be more outward-looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James-Chakraborty |first=Kathleen |date=2014-01-01 |pages=1–15|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |ISBN = 9780816673964 |doi = 10.5749/minnesota/9780816673964.003.0001 |chapter=Ming and Qing China |title = Architecture since 1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations and ruins of the Yuan capitol of [[Khanbaliq]] directly under the Forbidden City in Beijing were analysed by scholars to be both distinct from previous styles and ancestral to many later features of Ming and Qing architecture. Additionally the import of many Muslim officials, architects and scholars from the Islamic world during the Yuan led to an influx of Islamic design elements, especially in mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hou |first=Renzhi |year=2014 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |ISBN =9783642553202 |doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-55321-9_7 |chapter = Khanbaliq (1267–1368) of the Yüan Dynasty (1260–1368) |title = An Historical Geography of Peiping |series = China Academic Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zhenghai Mosque in Ningbo city, Zhejiang province is a type of Islamic Architecture which appeared in China during the Song dynasty (990AD). When the Arabic traders arrived at the big commercial city of Ningbo and settled down there, they spread the Muslim culture and built a mosque. Later, more mosques were built around Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Hagras, Hamada Muhammed (2017).

There are many miniature pagodas in Northeast China. They were built when the Buddhists came from India to spread Buddhism during the Liao dynasty (907-1125), and the empire supported the practice of Buddhism. They developed some new types of Buddhist architecture building with bricks. So, we can find many high-rise pagodas from Hebei Province to Beijing and Inner Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Youn-mi (2017).

== Influence in neighboring Asian countries ==
Chinese architecture has been influential in varying degrees in the development of the architecture of many neighboring Asian countries. After the Tang dynasty, the era when much Chinese culture was imported en masse by neighboring nations, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]], where the [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof]] design is ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tA_3y2XsMMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Barron's how to Prepare for the AP World History Examination|first=John|last=McCannon|date=19 March 2018|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="steinhardt 2004 228" /&gt;In [[Architecture of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], Chinese architecture has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture, alongside influences from [[Architecture of India|Indian]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_History_of_the_British_Empire.html?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|first=Robin|last=Winks|date=21 October 1999|publisher=OUP Oxford|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tJM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=East+Asia#v=onepage&amp;q=East+Asia&amp;f=false|title=Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: The Viháras of Anurádhapura|first=S.

The [[Chinese guardian lions|Chinese-origin guardian lion]] is also found in front of Buddhist temples, buildings and some Hindu temples (in Nepal) across Asia including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kgorman.ca/monster-monday-guardian-lions/|title=Monster Monday: Guardian Lions|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=kgorman.ca|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variation==
There is considerable regional variance in traditional Chinese architecture, some of which are very divergent from general layouts. Several of the more notable regional styles include:
===Shanxi architecture===
{{main|Shanxi architecture}} 
Shanxi preserves the oldest wooden structures in China from [[Tang dynasty]], including the [[Foguang Temple]] and [[Nanchan Temple]]. [[Yungang Grottoes]] in [[Datong]] and numerous Buddhist temples in the sacred [[Mount Wutai]] exemplify the religious architectures of China.
[[Shanxi Courtyard Houses|Shanxi family compounds]] are representative of [[vernacular architecture]] in North China. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, [[yaodong]] is a type of [[earth shelter]] that are commonly found.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Lingnan (Cantonese) architecture===
{{main|Cantonese architecture}} 
The classical Lingnan architecture is used primarily in the southern province of [[Guangdong]] and the eastern half of the neighboring [[Guangxi]]. It is noted for its use of carvings and sculptures for decorations, green brick, balconies, "Cold alleys", "Narrow doors", and many other characteristics adaptive to the [[subtropical]] region.
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;
File:Ho Ancestral Hall A.jpg|The '''Ho Ancestral Hall''' in [[Panyu]], [[Guangzhou]]; Built in 14th century, it utilizes manner door - a second door behind the main one, which is related to Cantonese Feng shui culture.
File:The Chen Clan's Academy.jpg|[[Chen Clan Ancestral Hall|Chan Clan Academy]] in Gwongzau is often cited as a representative example of Lingnan architecture.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Minnan (Hokkien) architecture===
{{main|Hokkien architecture}} 
Minnan architecture, or Hokkien architecture, refers to the architectural style of the [[Hoklo people]], the Han Chinese group who have been the dominant demographic of most of [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]]. This style is noted for its use of swallowtail roofs (heavily decorated upward-curving roof ridges) and "cut porcelain carving" for decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Hongyin, X. (2009). Research on the comparison of the Minnan new jiageng architecture [J]. Fujian Architecture &amp; Construction, 5, 008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Hakka architecture===
{{main|Hakka architecture}}
[[Hakka people]] have been noted for building very distinctive walled villages in order to protect themselves from [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars|clan wars]].
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Gan architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Jiangxi}}
The [[Gan Chinese]]-speaking province of [[Jiangxi]] is noted for its distinct style, making use of bricks, wood, and stones as materials, primarily erected with wooden frames. 
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Yaodong ===
{{Main|Yaodong}}
The [[Jin Chinese]] cultural area of [[Shanxi]] and northern [[Shaanxi]] are noted for carving their homes into the sides of mountains. The soft rock of the [[Loess Plateau]] in this region makes for an excellent insulating material.&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;
File:Cave houses shanxi 1.jpg

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Others===
Aside from the above, there are many other regional styles, such as [[Hutong]], which is prevalent in [[northern China]], [[Longtang]] and [[Shikumen]] of [[Haipai]] (Shanghainese) architecture, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7898">The '''Construction Management Association of America''' ('''CMAA''') is a non-profit and non-governmental, professional association serving the [[construction management]] industry.  The Association was formed in 1982. Current membership is more than 14,000, including individual CM/PM practitioners, corporate members, and construction owners in both public and private sectors, along with academic and associate members. CMAA has 29 regional chapters.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Website http://cmaanet.org/about-cmaa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards of Practice==
CMAA published the most recent revision of its ''Construction Management Standards of Practice'' in 2015. The SOP has been published and updated regularly by CMAA since the 1980s. It outlines standards for professional CM services in the areas of:
* Project Management
* Cost Management
* Time Management
* Quality Management
* Contract Administration
* Safety Management
* Program Management
* Sustainability
* Risk Management
* Building Information Modeling

==Certification==
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, there is a growing movement toward [[certification]] of [[construction]] managers.&lt;ref&gt;''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition'', Department of Labor, Construction Managers http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos005.htm&lt;/ref&gt; CMAA established a voluntary certification program for construction managers, known as the Certified Construction Manager (CCM) program.The Construction Manager Certification Institute (CMCI)was established by CMAA to oversee the organization's certification program. In 2006, the CCM program was accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;"CMAA's Certification Program Wins Accreditation from ANSI" ''Engineering News-Record'' http://enr.ecnext.com/coms2/article_necoar060410b&lt;/ref&gt; under the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 17024, which recognizes certification programs for conformity assessment or a "demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;American National Standards Institute https://www.ansica.org/wwwversion2/outside/&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCM certification requires individuals to possess a requisite amount of experience and/or education. The eligibility requirements are:

1. Forty-eight months' experience as a CM in the qualifying areas as defined by the Qualifications Matrix and 2. One of the following:

*An undergraduate (4-year BA/BS level) or graduate degree in [[construction management]], [[architecture]], [[engineering]] or [[construction science]].
*A 2-year undergraduate degree (AA/AS level) or certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 4 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.)
*No degree/certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 8 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.)

In addition, two reference letters from a client or owner are required; they can be from any two projects that a candidate is documenting as part of their 48-month requirement. Finally, the candidate must pass the certification exam.

Most applicants are certified within 4 to 7 months of submitting their applications. The length of time it takes to become certified depends upon how quickly a candidate can submit a complete application including project documentation, how quickly the references respond, and how quickly a candidate can take and pass the CCM exam.

In 2013, the Construction Industry Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.construction-institute.org Construction Industry Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Texas adopted the CCM as "a value-adding credential" following a joint effort to compare and harmonize CII's Construction Best Practices with the CMAA SOP, and to assure that the CCM examination measured and recognized mastery of the Best Practices.

==Education==
In 2013, CMAA became a member society of ABET, formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering Technologies, the leading organization accrediting undergraduate and graduate education programs in engineering and related fields. ABET has introduced a new accreditation for undergraduate programs in Construction Management, with program-specific criteria adopted in 2015.

==Advocacy==
CMAA does host an advocacy program to represent the construction management industry before the United States Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, and industry stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Website: Government Affairs http://cmaanet.org/government-affairs&lt;/ref&gt; CMAA is active in several industry coalitions advocating investment in infrastructure and other industry interests.

==College of Fellows==

A designation CMAA awards to certain members who have proven to be industry leaders and "who have made significant contributions to their organizations, the industry and their profession," according to CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;Members of the CMAA [http://cmaanet.org/college-fellows College of Fellows] http://cmaanet.org/fellows&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Fellows meet consistently to discuss CM standards and issues facing the profession. The College also produces industry topic white papers and all members are particularly active in the association, often having served as past national presidents or in other leadership roles.

==Publications==
The association produces several publications, including the ''Construction Management Standards of Practice'' which defines the standards and practices of the construction management profession. Other CMAA publications include a bi-monthly newsletter, the ''CM Advisor''.

==Events==
CMAA hosts two industry events every year for the construction management profession.

CMAA's signature event is its '''National Conference &amp; Trade Show'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmaanet.org/nationalconference National Conference &amp; Trade Show]&lt;/ref&gt; held every fall.The national conference offers multiple seminars which count toward CCM certification or renewal, as well as Continuing Education Units for a variety of purposes. The conference also includes an awards ceremony known as the Project Achievement Awards. CMAA designates a panel of judges to evaluate and select entries of projects with the most significant contributions to the construction management industry.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Project Achievement Awards {{cite web |url=http://cmaanet.org/cmaaprojectachievementawards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026025619/http://cmaanet.org/cmaaprojectachievementawards |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMAA's '''Capital Projects Symposium''' is held every spring. The Symposium is designed for as a high level exploration of trends and issues affecting the delivery of capital projects and programs.

CMAA has also conducted regular surveys of owner attitudes, preferences, needs and expectations across the industry, along with research into CM/PM fees, adoption of technology, workforce concerns and other topics.

It is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the process of entertaining guests at corporate events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.showsinabox.com/what-is-a-corporate-event/|title=What Is A Corporate Event? - Shows In a Box|date=2012-12-12|work=Shows In a Box|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies that provides corporate [[entertainment]] are called corporate event planners or corporate booking agencies.

== Types of corporate entertainment events ==
There are various types of corporate events that make use of entertainment.  An opening general session may include entertainment that adds excitement and presents the overall theme of the meeting. Mixers or pre-dinner parties many times use entertainment meant to provide a backdrop for conversation, perhaps an acoustic ensemble or pre-recorded music. Awards or gala events, usually the last event in a series of meetings, can make use of many options, from [[celebrity]] entertainers to exciting bands providing dance music or other options that will leave the attendees with a feeling of excitement and looking forward to the next meeting. There are many different types of corporate entertainment.

=== Corporate team building ===
Corporate entertainment can also include a day of [[team building]] activities. These activities include traditional camp activities like tug of war, scavenger hunts, and relay races. They could also include sports such as volleyball, soccer, or basketball. The goal of team building corporate entertainment is to have employees recognize how the challenges of the activities relate to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jada A. [http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2014/09/25/corporate-team-building-activities-the-good-the-bad-and-the-really-ugly/* "Corporate Team-Building Activities: The Good, the Bad and the Really Ugly"]. 25 Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Team chemistry, identifying strengths and attributes,  understanding how to work through solving problems as one, and reflecting makes for fruitful team building.

=== Corporate awards events ===
Awards or gala events are usually lavish events that celebrate accomplishment or milestones of a person or group of people in similar industries. Often these events serve as fundraisers for a specific cause. In addition to celebrating and recognizing achievements, it allows attendees to network with others with similar backgrounds or professions.

=== Corporate holiday celebration events ===
Holiday celebration events are ways for companies or departments to celebrate holidays and to show appreciation to employees. Entertainment at these events vary from raffles and door prizes, [[mystery dinner]]s, music and an overall casual, social setting that can build social relationships. For Christmas celebrations, some companies have used the ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' theme.

=== Corporate seminars and educational events ===
Corporate seminars, workshops, symposiums, and conferences are more informative in nature and often focussed on educational purposes.  A conference refers to a formal meeting where participants exchange their views on various topics.  A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at a university or offered by a commercial or professional organization. A workshop includes all the elements of the seminar, but with the largest portion emphasizing “hands-on-practice” or laboratory work.  A symposium is a formal gathering in an academic setting where participants are experts in their fields. Entertainment for these events varies from kick-op brunches to start, special industry guest speakers, and mixers, dinners  afterwards.  There are also booths set up for trade shows to display a companies strengths and for better marketing.

=== Corporate charity events ===
Corporate charity events, whether concerts, golf tournaments, or anything else, play an important role in how businesses interact with the community. Corporate charity events unite people from all levels of the organization; such events are another form of team building which positively influence other aspects of work.

      <comment>The name of the author of the third translation was the wrong way round ("Rocco, Sinisgalli") - in the other names the surname comes first. "Rocco" is a common Italian first name, and "Sinisgalli" cannot be anything but a surname, so I've changed this to "Sinisgalli, Rocco".~~~~</comment>

'''''De pictura''''' (English: "On Painting") is a treatise written by the Italian architect and art theorist [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. The first version, written in vernacular Italian in 1435 under the title '''''Della pittura''''', was for a general audience. The Latin version, the ''De pictura'' of 1439–41, was more technical and intended for scholars.&lt;ref name="StAndrews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E. F. |title=Mathematics and art - perspective |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Art.html |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is the first in a trilogy of treatises on the "Major arts" which had a widespread circulation during the [[Renaissance]], the others being ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' ("On Architecture", 1454) and ''De statua'' ("On Sculpture", 1462).

==Context==

Alberti was a member of [[history of Florence|Florentine]] family exiled in the 14th century, who was able to return in Florence only from 1434, in the following of the Papal court during the [[Council of Florence]]. Here he knew contemporary art innovators such as  [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Masaccio]], with whom he shared an interest for [[Renaissance humanism]] and classical art. Alberti was the first post-classical writer to produce a work of [[art theory]], as opposed to works about the function of religious art or art techniques, and reflected the developing [[Italian Renaissance art]] of his day.

Book III: advice to the adult painter on how to perfect his skill&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

===Approach===
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

''De pictura'' aimed to describe systematically the figurative arts through "geometry". Alberti divided painting into three parts:
*''Circumscriptio'' (Italian: ''disegno''), consisting in drawing the bodies' contour
*'' Compositio'' (''commensuratio'' in the Italian version of the treatise), including tracing the lines joining the bodies
* ''Receptio luminum'' (''color''), taking into consideration colors and light.

The treatise contained an analysis of all the techniques and painting theories known at the time, in this surpassing medieval works such as ''The book of Art'' by [[Cennino Cennini]] (1390). ''De pictura'' also includes the first description of linear geometric perspective around 1416; Alberti credited the discovery to [[Brunelleschi]], and dedicated the 1435 edition to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgerton|first1=Samuel Y.|title=Brunelleschi's mirror, Alberti's window, and Galileo's 'perspective tube'|journal=História, Ciências, Saúde-Manguinhos|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=suppl. 0|doi=10.1590/S0104-59702006000500010|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702006000500010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', (1985) [1940] [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Paul, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9MoshlkHpFYJ:www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/uploads/docs/s1_23.pdf+Paul+Barlow+Professor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjcjev4zZWsyXRk2Qb0TAbQHs52uwq7cmMmRBnlY97ah2aGpKYtVsGu-QOIeMciCrUfH45N1knB0NFikusclJybCwP5TMoAMaQJNS8TPzZFOBvOQvtUrmEPUT--Kqw8tmhvKr8G&amp;sig=AHIEtbSRK7DWVGwdLbYF38jvUAihfTFS0Q "The Death of History Painting in Nineteenth-Century Art?" PDF], ''Visual Culture in Britain'', Volume 6, Number 1, Summer 2005, pages 1–13&lt;/ref&gt;

''De pictura'' relied heavily on references to art in classical literature; in fact [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome (now effectively lost) was the only{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} modern (post-classical) work described in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Svetlana Alpers |author=Alpers, Svetlana Leontief |title=Ekphrasis and Aesthetic Attitudes in Vasari's Lives |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=23 |issue=3/4 |date=July 1960 |pages=190–192 |jstor=750591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
 [[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|350px|The accurate perspective in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s paintings such as his ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475–1480) derives from Alberti's ''De pictura''.]]

''De pictura'' influenced the work of artists including [[Donatello]], [[Ghiberti]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Ghirlandaio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lefaivre, Liane  |title=Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: Re-Cognizing the Architectural Body in the Early Italian Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocUH6f3l_E8C&amp;pg=PA135 |year=2005 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-62195-3 |pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] was the most influential of his recommendations, having a powerful effect on [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and through him on the whole Italian renaissance.&lt;ref name=Ackerman&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=James S. |title=Distance Points: Essays in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7EadYT-LTUC&amp;pg=PA87 |year=1994 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51077-6 |pages=86–87 |quote=No particular precept in the first part of De pictura had as pervasive an impact as the following section on perspective construction; the specific recommendations on color and shadow were ineffectual.. But the incalculable change that Leonardo wrought was directly dependent on Alberti's vision of art as a branch .. of optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti made at least 29 uses of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', deriving his key themes of simplicity and seriousness directly from Pliny. For example, Alberti advised artists to use colour with restraint, and to paint in the effect of gold rather than using actual gold in their paintings. Gold did indeed vanish from Italian paintings of the second part of the 15th century. Artists however found their own ways to paint with restraint, rather than following Alberti's actual instructions directly. Similarly, he encouraged artists to add black when modelling shapes, rather than only adding white as [[Cennino Cennini]] had advised in his c.&amp;nbsp;1390 ''Il Libro dell'Arte''. This advice had the effect of making Italian renaissance paintings more sombre. Alberti was here perhaps following Pliny's description of the dark varnish used by Apelles.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grafton |first1=Anthony |last2=Most |first2=Glenn W. |last3=Settis |first3=Salvatore |title=The Classical Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&amp;pg=PA214 |year=2010 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''diffuse extragalactic background radiation''' (DEBRA) refers to the diffuse photon field from extragalactic origin that fills our Universe. It contains photons over ∼ 20 decades of energy from ~10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; eV to ~100 GeV. The origin and the physical processes involved are different within every wavelength range. There are plenty of observational evidences that support the existence of the DEBRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The figure shows a schematic picture, based on many different data sets, of the spectral intensity (also called spectral radiance) multiplied by wavelength of the DEBRA over all the electromagnetic spectrum. This representation is convenient because the area inside the curve is the energy. The nature and history of the universe is coded in this radiation field and any realistic cosmological model must be able to describe it. Understanding the DEBRA is a major challenge of modern cosmology with huge consequences in other fields of astrophysics, therefore extraordinary efforts are being put by theoreticians, observers, and instrumentalists to do so.

==Regions of the DEBRA==
The overall diffuse extragalactic radiation field may be divided in different regions according to their origin and physical processes involved. This is a standard classification from the highest down to the lowest energies:

* [[Diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray radiation]] (also known as [[cosmic gamma-ray background]])
* [[Cosmic X-ray background]]
* [[Extragalactic background light]] (which includes the [[cosmic infrared background]])
* [[Cosmic microwave background]]
* [[Cosmic radio background]]

In [[astronomy]], '''dropout''' is a [[radiation]] source whose radiation intensity falls off sharply below a specific [[wavelength]]. The source will be easily visible when its light is filtered to wavelengths longer than the cutoff value, but will "drop out" of the image when it is filtered to wavelengths shorter than the threshold.

This is a standard method for locating distant galaxies in [[Hubble Deep Field|deep field images]]. Because the [[hydrogen]] that surrounds the galaxies absorbs light with a wavelength around 100 nanometers, the galaxies have a natural dropout threshold. The exact wavelength of this threshold is [[redshift]]ed and can be used to determine the distance to the galaxy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3049">'''Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems''' ('''DDDAS''') is a new paradigm whereby the computation and instrumentation aspects of an application system are dynamically integrated in a feed-back control loop, in the sense that instrumentation data can be dynamically incorporated into the executing model of the application, and in reverse the executing model can control the instrumentation.  Such approaches have been shown that can enable more accurate and faster modeling and analysis of the characteristics and behaviors of a system and can exploit data in intelligent ways to convert them to new capabilities, including decision support systems with the accuracy of full scale modeling, efficient data collection, management, and data mining. The DDDAS concept - and the term - was proposed by [[Frederica Darema]] for the [https://www.nsf.gov/cise/cns/darema/dd_das/index_wkshp.jsp National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop in March 2000].

There are several affiliated annual meetings and conferences, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">'''Extended order''' is an [[economics]] and [[sociology]] concept introduced by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]''. It is a description of what happens when a system embraces [[Specialization (functional)|specialization]] and [[trade]] and "constitutes an information gathering process, able to call up, and put to use, widely [[dispersed knowledge|dispersed information]] that no [[central planning]] agency, let alone any individual, could know as a whole, possess or control.”&lt;ref name="Hayek"&gt;Hayek, F.A. "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism". The University of Chicago Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} The result is an interconnected web where people can benefit from the actions and knowledge of those they don't know. This is possible and efficient because a proper [[law|legal]] framework replaces [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], which is only practical in small circles of people who know each other socially. The extended order is at the heart of Hayek's thesis, in ''The Fatal Conceit'', where he argues that "our civilization depends, not only for its origin but also for its preservation, on what can be precisely described only as the extended order of human cooperation, an order more commonly, if somewhat misleading, known as [[capitalism]].”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The ''extended order'' "is a framework of institutions – economic, legal, and moral – into which we fit ourselves by obeying certain rules of conduct that ''we never made'', and which ''we have never understood'' in the sense of which we understand how the things that we manufacture function.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|14}} This "order resulted ''not'' from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional &amp; largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection – the comparative increase in population &amp; wealth – of those groups that happened to follow them.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The adoption of these practices, by these groups, “increased their access to valuable information of all sorts, &amp; enabled them to be 'fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

The extended order's formation “required individuals to change their ‘natural’ or instinctual’ responses to others, something strongly resisted", whereas any &amp; all "constraints on the practices of the small group, it must be emphasized &amp; repeated, are ''hated''.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is because man “knows so many objects that seem desirable but for which he is not permitted to grasp, and he cannot see how other beneficial features of his environment depend on the discipline to which he is forced to submit – a discipline forbidding him to reach out for these same appealing objects. Disliking these constraints so much, we can hardly be said to have selected them; rather, these constraints selected us: they enabled us to survive.”&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

The evolutionary process of the extended order can be stimulated by increases in individual freedom and has even realized some of its greatest advances during times of anarchy, however it can (and quite often has throughout history) been hindered by government constraint, as Hayek says, "Protection of several property, not the direction of its use by government, laid the foundations for the growth of the dense network of exchange of services that shaped the extended order."&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The extended order is "not a creation of man's reason but a distinct second endowment conferred on him by cultural evolution."&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|52}}

Not being genetically transferred, the continuing cultural evolution of the extended order requires teaching &amp; passing on to each new generation the prevailing traditions, customs, morality &amp; rules.&lt;ref name="Hayek" /&gt;{{rp|25}} This cultural evolutionary requirement was also analyzed by [[Will Durant|Will]] and [[Ariel Durant]] who said: "Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again."&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant and Ariel Durant, "[[The Lessons of History]]". Simon &amp; Schuster. 1968; p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extracellular fluid''' ('''ECF''') denotes all [[body fluid]] outside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. [[Body water|Total body water]] in humans makes up between 45 to 75% of total body weight. About two thirds of this is [[intracellular fluid]] within cells, and one third is the extracellular fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=G|title=Principles of anatomy and physiology|date=1987|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-350729-3|page=693|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main component of the extracellular fluid is the '''interstitial fluid''' that bathes cells.

[[Lymph]] makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=548|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the [[transcellular fluid]] (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components – plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells.&lt;ref name="pmid_19817339"&gt;{{Citation |last=Canavan |first=A |last2=Arant |first2=BS Jr |year=2009 |title=Diagnosis and management of dehydration in children |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=80 |issue=7 |pages=692–696 |pmid=19817339 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/1001/p692.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body's [[milieu intérieur|internal environment]] that bathes all of the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of [[Homeostasis|homeostatic mechanisms]] involving [[negative feedback]]. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the [[pH#Living systems|pH]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]] concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, [[blood glucose]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon dioxide]] levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained.   
 
The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70&amp;nbsp;kg is 20% of body weight – about fourteen litres. Eleven litres is interstitial fluid and the remaining three litres is plasma.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|pages=286–287|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
The main component of the extracellular fluid is the '''interstitial fluid''' which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the [[circulatory system]] called [[blood plasma]].  The remaining small percentage of ECF includes the [[transcellular fluid]]. These constituents are often called [[fluid compartments]]. The transcellular fluid includes the [[aqueous humour]] in the [[eye]], the [[synovial fluid]] in the [[joint]]s, the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]], the [[serous fluid]] in the [[serous membranes]] lining [[Body cavity|body cavities]] and in the [[saliva]] and other gut fluids ([[gastric juice]], [[pancreatic juice]] and other intestinal secretions), as well as the [[perilymph]] and [[endolymph]] in the inner ear. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70&amp;nbsp;kg, is 20% of body weight – about fourteen litres. 

The interstitial fluid and the plasma make up about 97% of the ECF, and a small percentage of this is [[lymph]]. Interstitial fluid is fluid that surround cells providing them with nutrients and removing their waste products. Eleven litres of the ECF is interstitial fluid and the remaining three litres is plasma.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; Plasma and interstitial fluid are very similar because water, ions, and small solutes are continuously exchanged between them across the walls of capillaries, through pores and [[Intercellular cleft#Capillary intercellular clefts|capillary clefts]].

Interstitial fluid consists of a water solvent containing sugars, salts, fatty acids, amino acids, coenzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, white blood cells and cell waste-products. This solution accounts for 26% of the water in the human body. The composition of interstitial fluid depends upon the exchanges between the cells in the biological tissue and the blood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Widmaier, Eric P., Hershel Raff, Kevin T. Strang, and Arthur J. Vander. "Body Fluid Compartments." ''Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function''. 14th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2016. 400-401. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that tissue fluid has a different composition in different tissues and in different areas of the body.

The plasma that filters through the capillaries into the interstitial fluid does not contain red blood cells or platelets as they are too large to pass through but can contain some white blood cells to help the immune system.

Once the extracellular fluid collects into small vessels it is considered to be lymph, and the vessels that carry it back to the blood are called the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic system returns protein and excess interstitial fluid to the circulation.

The ionic composition of the interstitial fluid and blood plasma vary due to the Gibbs–Donnan effect. This causes a slight difference in the concentration of cations and anions between the two fluid compartments.

[[File:Sodium-potassium pump and diffusion.png|thumb|340px|Sodium-potassium pump and the diffusion between extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid]]
The extracellular fluid provides the medium for the exchange of substances between the ECF and the cells, and this can take place through dissolving, mixing and transporting in the fluid medium.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard|title=Principles of anatomy and physiology|date=1987|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|isbn=0-06-046669-3|pages=61–62|edition=5th ed.

Harper international}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECF also contains materials [[Secretion|secreted]] from cells in soluble form, but which quickly coalesces into fibres (e.g. [[collagen]], [[reticular connective tissue|reticular]], and [[elastic fibres]]) or precipitates out into a solid or semisolid form (e.g. [[proteoglycans]] which form the bulk of [[cartilage]], and the components of [[bone]]). These and many other substances occur, especially in association with various proteoglycans to form the  [[extracellular matrix]] or the "filler" substance between the cells throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level|last=Voet|first=Donald|last2=Voet|first2=Judith|last3=Pratt|first3=Charlotte|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=978-1-118-91840-1|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; These substances occur in the extracellular space, and are therefore all bathed or soaked in ECF, without being part of the ECF.

==Regulation==
The internal environment is stabilised in the process of [[homeostasis]]. Complex homeostatic mechanisms operate to regulate and keep the composition of the ECF stable. Individual cells can also regulate their internal composition by various mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Pocock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=3|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basis of Membrane Potential2.png|thumb|right|350px|Differences in the concentrations of ions giving the membrane potential.]] 
There is a significant difference between the concentrations of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] ions inside and outside the cell. The concentration of sodium ions is considerably higher in the extracellular fluid than in the intracellular fluid.&lt;ref name="tortora"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard|title=Principles of anatomy and physiology|date=1987|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, International|location=New York|isbn=0-06-046669-3|pages= 40, 49–50, 61, 268–274, 449–453, 456, 494–496, 530–552, 693–700|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The converse is true of the potassium ion concentrations inside and outside the cell. These differences cause all [[cell membrane]]s to be electrically charged, with the positive charge on the outside of the cells and the negative charge on the inside. In a resting neuron (not conducting an impulse) the [[membrane potential]] is known as the [[resting potential]], and between the two sides of the membrane is about -70 mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tortora|first=Gerald|title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology|year=1987|isbn=0-06-046669-3|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This potential is created by [[sodium-potassium pump]]s in the cell membrane, which pump sodium ions out of the cell, into the ECF,  in return for potassium ions which enter the cell from the ECF. The maintenance of this difference in the concentration of ions between the inside of the cell and the outside, is critical to keep normal cell volumes stable, and also to enable some cells to generate [[action potential]]s.&lt;ref name="GJT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard|title=Principles of anatomy and physiology|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-64608-3|pages=73–74|edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several cell types [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s in the cell membrane can be temporarily opened under specific circumstances for a few microseconds at a time. This allows a brief inflow of sodium ions into the cell (driven in by the sodium ion concentration gradient that exists between the outside and inside of the cell). This causes the cell membrane to temporarily depolarize (lose its electrical charge) forming the basis of action potentials.

The sodium ions in the ECF also play an important role in the movement of water from one body compartment to the other. When tears are secreted, or saliva is formed, sodium ions are pumped from the ECF into the ducts in which these fluids are formed and collected. The water content of these solutions results from the fact water follows the sodium ions (and accompanying [[anion]]s) osmotically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=G|last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas|title=Principles of anatomy and physiology|date=1987|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-350729-3|pages=34,621, 693–694|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~petesmif/petesmif/salivary%20secretion/fluid%20secretion.htm |title=Data |website=pcwww.liv.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same principle applies to the formation of many other [[body fluid]]s.

Calcium ions have a great propensity to [[Calcium metabolism#Function|bind to proteins]].&lt;ref name="stryer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biochemistry.|last1=Stryer|first1=Lubert|publisher=W.H.

The proteins that are particularly sensitive to changes in the ECF ionized calcium concentration are several of the [[clotting factors]] in the blood plasma, which are functionless in the absence of calcium ions, but become fully functional on the addition of the correct concentration of calcium salts.&lt;ref name=tortora /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; The [[Sodium channels|voltage gated sodium ion channels]] in the cell membranes of nerves and muscle have an even greater sensitivity to changes in the ECF ionized calcium concentration.&lt;ref name=CMArmstrong1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armstrong CM, Cota G | title = Calcium block of Na+ channels and its effect on closing rate | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 4154–7 | date = Mar 1999 | pmid = 10097179 | pmc = 22436 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.7.4154 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4154A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CMArmstrong&gt;{{cite journal |author= Armstrong, C.M. |author2=Cota, Gabriel. |title=Calcium block of Na+ channels and its effect on closing rate |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=4154–4157 |year=1999 |pmid=10097179 |pmc=22436 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.7.4154|bibcode=1999PNAS...96.4154A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively small decreases in the plasma ionized calcium levels ([[hypocalcemia]]) cause these channels to leak sodium into the nerve cells or axons, making them hyper-excitable, thus causing spontaneous muscle spasms ([[tetany]]) and [[paraesthesia]] (the sensation of "pins and needles") of the extremities and round the mouth.&lt;ref name=macefield /&gt;&lt;ref name=CMArmstrong /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harrison TR | title =Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = third | pages = 170, 571–579 | location = New York | publisher =  McGraw-Hill Book Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plasma ionized calcium rises above normal ([[hypercalcemia]]) more calcium is bound to these sodium channels having the opposite effect, causing lethargy, muscle weakness, anorexia, constipation and labile emotions.&lt;ref name=harrison /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waters|first=M|title=Hypercalcemia|journal=InnovAiT|year=2009|volume=2|issue=12|doi=10.1093/innovait/inp143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tertiary structure of proteins is also affected by the [[pH]] of the bathing solution. In addition, the pH of the ECF affects the proportion of the total amount of calcium in the plasma which occurs in the free, or ionized form, as opposed to the fraction that is bound to protein and phosphate ions. A change in the pH of the ECF therefore alters the ionized calcium concentration of the ECF. Since the [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH of the ECF is directly dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] in the ECF, [[hyperventilation]], which lowers the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the ECF, produces symptoms that are almost indistinguishable from low plasma ionized calcium concentrations.&lt;ref name=macefield /&gt;

The extracellular fluid is constantly "stirred" by the [[circulatory system]], which ensures that the [[Milieu intérieur|watery environment]] which bathes the body’s cells is virtually identical throughout the body. This means that nutrients can be secreted into the ECF in one place (e.g. the gut, liver, or fat cells) and will, within about a minute, be evenly distributed throughout the body. Hormones are similarly rapidly and evenly spread to every cell in the body, regardless of where they are secreted into the blood. Oxygen taken up by the lungs from the alveolar air is also evenly distributed at the [[Respiratory system#Gas exchange|correct partial pressure]] to all the cells of the body. Waste products are also uniformly spread to the whole of the ECF, and are removed from this general circulation at specific points (or organs), once again ensuring that there is generally no localized accumulation of unwanted compounds or excesses of otherwise essential substances (e.g. sodium ions, or any of the other constituents of the ECF). The only significant exception to this general principle is the plasma in the [[vein]]s, where the concentrations of dissolved substances in individual veins differs, to varying degrees, from those in the rest of the ECF. However this plasma is confined within the waterproof walls of the venous tubes, and therefore does not affect the interstitial fluid in which the body's cell live. When the blood from all the veins in body mixes in the heart and lungs, the differing compositions cancel out (e.g. acidic blood from active muscles is neutralized by the alkaline blood [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|homeostatically]] produced by the kidneys). From the [[Atrium (heart)|left atrium]] onward, to every organ in the body, the normal, homeostatically regulated values of all of the ECF's components are therefore restored.

==Interaction between the blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph==
{{Further |Starling equation |Microcirculation#Capillary exchange}}
[[File:Capillary microcirculation.svg |thumb|Formation of interstitial fluid from blood.]]
[[File: Illu lymph capillary.png |thumb |Diagram showing the formation of lymph from interstitial fluid (labeled here as "Tissue fluid"). The tissue fluid is entering the blind ends of [[lymph capillaries]] (shown as deep green arrows)]]
The arterial blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph interact at the level of the blood [[capillary|capillaries]]. The capillaries are [[Vascular permeability|permeable]] and water can move freely in and out. At the [[arteriole|arteriolar end]] of the capillary the blood pressure is greater than the [[Hydrostatics#Medicine|hydrostatic pressure]] in the tissues.&lt;ref name="Guyton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|pages=177–181|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tortora /&gt; Water will therefore seep out of the capillary into the interstitial fluid. The pores through which this water moves are large enough to allow all the smaller molecules (up to the size of small proteins such as [[insulin]]) to move freely through the capillary wall as well. This means that their concentrations across the capillary wall equalize, and therefore have no osmotic effect (because the osmotic pressure caused by these small molecules and ions – called the [[Crystalloid solution|crystalloid osmotic pressure]] to distinguish it from the osmotic effect of the larger molecules than cannot move across the capillary membrane – is the same on both sides of capillary wall).&lt;ref name= "Guyton" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tortora /&gt;

The movement of water out of the capillary at the arteriolar end causes the concentration of the substances that cannot cross the capillary wall to increase as the blood moves to the [[Venule|venular]] end of the capillary. The most important substances that are confined to the capillary tube are [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], the [[Globulin|plasma globulins]] and [[fibrinogen]]. They, and particularly the plasma albumin, because of its molecular abundance in the plasma, are responsible for the so called [[Oncotic pressure|"oncotic" or "colloid" osmotic pressure]] which draws water back into the capillary, especially at the venular end.&lt;ref name= "Guyton" /&gt;

The net effect of all of these processes is that water moves out of and back into the capillary, while the crystalloid substances in the capillary and interstitial fluids equilibrate. Since the capillary fluid is constantly and rapidly renewed by the flow of the blood, its composition dominates the equilibrium concentration that is achieved in the capillary bed. This ensures that the [[Milieu intérieur|watery environment]] of the body’s cells is always close to their ideal environment (set by the body's [[Homeostasis|homeostats]]).

A small proportion of the solution that leaks out of the capillaries is not drawn back into the capillary by the colloid osmotic forces. This amounts to between 2-4 liters per day for the body as a whole. This water is collected by the [[Lymphatic vessel|lymphatic system]] and is ultimately discharged into the left [[subclavian vein]], where it mixes with the venous blood coming from the left arm, on its way to the heart.&lt;ref name=tortora /&gt; The [[lymph]] flows through [[Lymph capillary|lymph capillaries]] to [[lymph node]]s where bacteria and tissue debris are removed from the lymph, while various types of [[white blood cells]] (mainly [[lymphocytes]]) are added to the fluid. In addition the lymph which drains the small intestine contains fat droplets called [[chylomicron]]s after the ingestion of a fatty meal.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; This lymph is called [[chyle]] which has a milky appearance, and imparts the name [[lacteal]]s (referring to the milky appearance of their contents) to the lymph vessels of the small intestine.&lt;ref name=grays&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. |title=Gray’s Anatomy| pages=821 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |publication-date=1989|isbn= 0443 041776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracellular fluid may be mechanically guided in this circulation by the vesicles between other structures.  Collectively this forms the [[interstitium]], which may be considered a newly identified biological structure in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rettner|first1=Rachel|title=Meet Your Interstitium, a Newfound "Organ"|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-your-interstitium-a-newfound-organ/|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some debate over whether the interstitium is an organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/52168/title/Is-the-Interstitium-Really-a-New-Organ-/|title=Is the Interstitium Really a New Organ?|last=|first=|date=|website=The Scientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forensic profiling''' is the study of [[trace evidence]] in order to develop [[Offender profiling|information]] which can be used by [[Police|police authorities]]. This information can be used to identify suspects and convict them in a court of law.

The term "[[forensic]]" in this context refers to "information that is used in court as evidence" {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2006|p=10}}. The traces originate from criminal or litigious activities themselves. However traces are information that is not strictly dedicated to the court. They may increase knowledge in broader domains linked to security that deal with investigation, intelligence, surveillance, or risk analysis {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2008|p=26}}. 

Forensic profiling is different than [[offender profiling]], which only refers to the identification of an offender to the psychological profile of a criminal.

In particular, forensic profiling should refer to [[profiling (information science)|profiling]] in the information sciences sense, i.e., to "The process of 'discovering' correlations between data in data bases that can be used to identify and represent a human or nonhuman subject (individual or group), and/or the application of profiles (sets of correlated data) to individuate and represent a subject or to identify a subject as a member of a group or category"  {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2006|p=41}}.

== Profiling techniques ==

Forensic profiling is generally conducted using [[datamining]] technology, as a means by which relevant patterns are discovered, and profiles are generated from large quantities of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://v5.books.elsevier.com/bookscat/samples/9780750676137/9780750676137.pdf|title=Pre-Crime Data Mining|last=|first=|date=|website=cs.brown.edu/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction of forms of profiles that are used in a given context is necessary before evaluating applications of [[data mining]] techniques for forensic profiling.

== Data available ==

The data available to law enforcement agencies are divided into two categories {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2008|p=15}}:
* '''Nominal data''' directly designates persons or objects (recidivists, intelligence files and suspect files, stolen vehicles or objects, etc.) and their relations. Nominal data may also be obtained in the framework of specific investigations, for instance a list of calls made with a [[mobile phone]] (card and/or phone) that cover a certain period of time, a list of people corresponding to a certain profile, or data obtained through surveillances;
* '''Crime data''' consist of traces that result from criminal activities: physical traces, other information collected at the scene, from witness or victims or some electronic traces, as well as reconstructed descriptions of cases (modus operandi, time intervals, duration and place) and their relations (links between cases, series).

== Types ==

* [[DNA profiling]]  Used for the identification of individuals on the basis of their respective DNA profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* '''Digital Image Forensics'''. This covers: ''image source identification'' (which is based on specific characteristics of the image acquisition device or technology) and ''malicious post-processing or tampering'' (which aim is for instance to verify the integrity of particular features) {{Harv|Popescu|Farid|2005}}.
* '''Illicit drug profiling''', which refers to the systematic extraction and storage of chemical attributes of drugs seized in order to obtain indications on the manufacture and distribution processes, the size and the evolution of the market). {{Harv|Terrettaz-Zufferey|Ratle|Ribaux|Esseiva|Khanevski|2007}}
* '''Forensic Information Technology''' (forensic IT), which refers to the analysis of the [[digital traces]] that people leave when using [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forensiccontrol.com/resources/beginners-guide-computer-forensics/|title=An introduction to Computer Forensics by Forensic Control|work=Forensic Control|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Offender profiling''' i.e. psychological profiling of the criminal.

== Issues ==
The use of profiling techniques represents threats to the [[privacy]] of the individual and to the protection of [[Human rights|fundamental freedoms]]. Indeed, criminal data, i.e., data which are collected and processed for suppressing criminal offences, often consists of personal data. One of the issues is the re-use of personal data collected within one criminal investigation for another purpose than the one for which it was collected.

Several methods-including technical, legal, and behavioral-are available to address some of the issues associated with forensic profiling. For instance, in Europe the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides a number of instruments for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7321">'''Forest genetic resources''' or '''tree genetic resources''' are genetic material of shrub and tree species of actual or future value. Forest genetic resources are essential for forest-depending communities who rely for a substantial part of their livelihoods on [[timber]] and [[non-timber forest product]]s (for example fruits, gums and resins) for food security, domestic use and income generation. These resources are also the basis for large-scale wood production in planted forests to satisfy the worldwide need for timber and paper. Genetic resources of several important timber, fruit and other non-timber tree species are conserved [[ex situ]] in genebanks or maintained in field collections. Nevertheless, [[in situ conservation]] in forests and on farms is in the case of most tree species the most important measure to protect their genetic resources.

==Understanding diversity==

A better understanding of the diversity of these species is crucial for their sustainable use and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Dawson, I.K. |author2=Lengkeek, A. |author3=Weber, J.C. |author4=Jamnadass, R. |year= 2009 |title= Managing genetic variation in tropical trees: linking knowledge with action in agroforestry ecosystems for improved conservation and enhanced livelihoods |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=18 |doi= 10.1007/s10531-008-9516-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring  ol patterns of distribution and genetic diversity of these species allows the  prioritization of populations for [[in situ conservation]], identification of populations and species  most at risk and existing gaps in genebank collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scheldeman, X.  |author2=van Zonneveld, M.|year=2010|title=Training Manual on Spatial Analysis of Plant Diversity and Distribution|publisher=Bioversity International

==The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources==
In 2014, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] published the first [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fgr/64582/en/ State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN urges action to protect forests' genetic diversity|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27715552|accessdate=23 July 2014|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC News Science and Environment|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources|date=2014|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3825e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Action needed to safeguard genetic diversity of the world's forests|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/233303/icode/|publisher=FAO|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication addressed the conservation, management and sustainable use of forest tree and other woody [[plant genetic resources]] of actual and potential value for human well-being in the broad range of management systems.  It was prepared based on information provided by 86 countries, outcomes from regional and subregional consultations, and commissioned [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fgr/71306/en/ thematic studies]. Amongst the [http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3827e.pdf ten key findings], half of the forest species reported as regularly utilized by countries are threatened by the conversion of forests to pastures and farmland, [[overexploitation]], and the impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redassranch.com/ |title=Redassranch Agriculture, gardening and forestry resources |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g4lsW85R?url=http://www.redassranch.com/ |archivedate=March 17, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the information and knowledge compiled by [[FAO]] for The State of World’s Forest Genetic Resources, the [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] developed the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Plan of Action for the conservation, sustainable use and development of forest genetic resources|date=2014|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3849e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Global Plan of Action identifies 27 strategic priorities grouped into 4 areas: 1) improving the availability of, and access to, information on forest genetic resources; 2) conservation of forest genetic resources (in situ and ex situ); 3) sustainable use, development and management of forest genetic resources; 4) policies, institutions and capacity-building.

==Forest genetic resources and climate change==
Even though this is a field with many uncertainties, it is evident that during the next 50–100 years climate changes will have an effect on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a [[species]] (or a [[population]]) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, [[drought]], [[Pest (organism)|pests]], [[disease]]s and [[forest fire]]s.&lt;ref name=Kelleher15&gt;{{citation |last1=Kelleher et al. |title=Approaches to the conservation of forest genetic resources in Europe in the context of climate change |publisher=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] |date=2015 |url=http://www.euforgen.org/publications/publication/approaches-to-the-conservation-of-forest-genetic-resources-in-europe-in-the-context-of-climate-chang/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though forest trees are known for showing great plasticity in their response to climate changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savolainen et al.|title=Adaptive Potential of Northernmost Tree Populations to Climate Change, with Emphasis on Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)|journal=Journal of Heredity|date=2011|volume=102 |issue=5|pages=526–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all species are naturally capable to adapt at the pace necessary. For that reason human interventions, such as transfer of [[forest reproductive material]], may be needed. This is particular important for rare and scattered distributed species and species found on the edge of its [[distribution range]].&lt;ref name=Kelleher15/&gt;

The gamma-ray and X-ray source '''GRS 1124-683''', discovered by the [[Granat]] mission and [[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]],  is a system containing a [[black hole]] candidate. The system also goes by the name X-ray Nova Muscae 1991 or '''GU Muscae'''. These two orbiting X-ray telescopes discovered the system when the system produced an outburst of X-rays on January 9, 1991.

==Black hole system==

It is one of several likely black hole systems that are classified as X-ray novae. Such a nova periodically produces bright outbursts of X-rays, along with visible light and other forms of energy.

In such a system, a black hole pulls gas from the surface of a companion star. The gas forms a thin disk around the black hole, known as an accretion disk. In an X-ray nova, the flow of gas is fairly thin and slow, so the accretion disk remains relatively cool, and little gas falls into the black hole.

In the case of GU Muscae, the black hole is about seven times as massive as the Sun, while the companion is three-quarters as massive as the Sun. The companion is also cooler than the Sun, so its surface is redder, and the star's total luminosity is only one-third that of the Sun's. Its outer layers probably were blown away by the supernova explosion that gave birth to the black hole. The two stars orbit each other every 10.4 hours at a distance of roughly 2 million miles (3.2 million km).

==Spectral radiance==

During the January 20–21, 1991, outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced by positron annihilation.&lt;ref name=Sunyaev&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Sunyaev R, Churazov E, Gilfanov M, Dyachkov A, Khavenson N, Grebenev S, Kremnev R, Sukhanov K, Goldwurm A, Ballet J, Cordier B, Paul J, Denis M, Vedrenne G, Niel M, Jourdain E |title=X-ray nova in Musca (GRS 1124+68): hard X-ray source with narrow annihilation line |journal=Astrophys.

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

An '''involuntary narrative''' occurs as a personal reading of symbolic content transmitted by media-saturated environments. Exposure to postmodern nonlinear narratives, performative and mediated audiovisual arts, predisposes the individual to originate layers of symbolic meaning that overlap with socially codified environments.
The '''involuntary narrative''' has neither been constructed by an author of media content, nor read as such by a reader/spectator.

Illusion and displacement are some of the effects resulting in an individual, when connections are drawn between a trigger in one sensory channel and a result in another, virtual and physical states and conditions of one and the same object, media or technology are perceived as a continuum.  
When a purposeful overlap of the physical and the virtual takes place, it could be called [[vireal]] (Gramelsberger, Klein).

The '''involuntary narrative,''' [[hypnagogia]] and the [[Dreamachine]], trigger what is already in the individual by referring to his or her own past history. The '''involuntary narrative''' is accidental and in that differs from both the hypnagogic state and the state induced by the Dreamachine.

Auditive and visual signals, as for example mobile phone ringtones, virtual identity thumbnails, alert sounds, signals and information screens in public transport, adverts displayed in LED screens, constitute stimuli to trigger the occurrence of an involuntary narrative.
Anamnesis, as used by Pascal Broccolichi in his work ''Lexicon:'' ”when a sound, or a sound context, recalls a situation or an environment that has been taken out of its chronology”.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of “sound phenomena noted in various contexts with acoustic or psychoacoustic connotations”, published in: Palais de Tokyo/Magazine 09, Summer 2009, Spy Numbers, and available online at this address: http://www.pascalbroccolichi.com/index.php?/projets/lexicon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Influences==
As the density of visible and audible mass communication in the urban environment increased in the 20th century, historical predecessors of '''involuntary narratives''' emerged. The attempt to create parallel levels of meaning in the perception of the physically real is an objective these predecessors have in common.
Applying the [[cut-up technique]], invented in the 1960s by [[Bryon Gysin]], to text, [[William Burroughs]]&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, W. S. (1970). The Electronic Revolution. Ubuweb, 2005 edition. http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf (accessed 30-09-2010)&lt;/ref&gt; achieved results of new narratives (whose order/sequence had not been put together willingly) which would often yield surprising results, even giving account of future events that were later verified. 
The [[dérive]] (English: drift) developed in the 1950s by the [[Situationists]] is a technique to explore and navigate urban space without preformalized trajectories.
Misreadings of common everyday objects, as used in [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]], some of no symbolic content, some of highly symbolic content produce results similar to the ones described here, but are always authored.

In the United States, a '''judicial intern''' (also commonly known as a "'''judicial extern'''" or "'''extern law clerk'''" &lt;ref&gt;Externship Job Description, Los Angeles Superior Court http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/VolunteerOpportunities/UI/volunteerIEP/judicialOfficerAdults.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;) is usually a [[law student]] or sometimes a recent [[law school]] graduate who provides assistance to a [[judge]] and/or [[law clerks]] in researching and writing issues before the court. Working as a judicial intern allows law students to gain practical legal experience and familiarity with the court operations.

==Description==
Many judicial interns subsequently choose to work full-time as judicial law clerks immediately after graduation. These judicial "clerkships" generally last one year in which the law clerk works closely with the judge in assisting various matters before the court. Judicial clerkships tend to be a valuable experience to an attorney's career because of the work involved in both substantive and procedural issues. In many cases, a clerkship is a critical stepping stone into real practice. Most, if not all, major law firms pay "clerkship" bonuses to new associates who have completed a full one year clerkship term. &lt;ref&gt;The National Association for Law Placement (NALP) Study on Law School Activities (Reported by Students Receiving an Offer for a Judicial Clerkship) http://www.nalp.org/content/index.php?pid=219#29&lt;/ref&gt;  

Among the most prestigious judicial internships are those in the federal court of appeals, federal district courts, and in the state's supreme court. 

A judicial intern's selection process is similar to judicial clerkship positions.  Grades, class ranking, and relevant extracurricular activities such as membership in the law school's law review or being a member of the law school's Moot Court Board are common criteria in selecting a judicial intern.&lt;ref&gt;The American Bar Association's Frequently Asked Questions page on Judicial Internship Selection Criterion http://www.abanet.org/litigation/jiop/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4611">'''Knowledge acquisition''' is the process used to define the rules and ontologies required for a [[knowledge-based system]]. The phrase was first used in conjunction with [[expert systems]] to describe the initial tasks associated with developing an expert system, namely finding and interviewing [[knowledge domain|domain]] experts and capturing their knowledge via [[Rule-based system|rules]], [[Object-oriented programming|objects]], and [[Frame language|frame-based]] [[Ontologies (computer science)|ontologies]]. 

Expert systems were one of the first successful applications of [[artificial intelligence]] technology to real world business problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22–23|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[Stanford university|Stanford]] and other AI laboratories worked with doctors and other highly skilled experts to develop systems that could automate complex tasks such as [[medical diagnosis]]. Until this point computers had mostly been used to automate highly data intensive tasks but not for complex reasoning. Technologies such as [[Inference engine|inference engines]] allowed developers for the first time to tackle more complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

As expert systems scaled up from demonstration prototypes to industrial strength applications it was soon realized that the acquisition of domain expert knowledge was one of if not the most critical task in the [[knowledge engineering]] process. This knowledge acquisition process became an intense area of research on its own. One of the earlier works&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

One approach to knowledge acquisition investigated was to use [[natural language parsing]] and generation to facilitate knowledge acquisition. Natural language parsing could be performed on manuals and other expert documents and an initial first pass at the rules and objects could be developed automatically. Text generation was also extremely useful in generating explanations for system behavior. This greatly facilitated the development and maintenance of expert systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=Steven|title=A Survey of Knowledge Acquisition from Natural Language|journal=Technology Maturity Assessment (TMA)|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/akt/work/stephenp/TMA%20of%20KAfromNL.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent approach to knowledge acquisition is a re-use based approach. Knowledge can be developed in [[Ontology_(information_science)|ontologies]] that conform to standards such as the [[Web_Ontology_Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=Guus|title=Knowledge acquisition and the web|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|date=25 September 2012|issue=71|pages=206–210|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/papers/Schreiber13a.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017|publisher=Elsevior}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way knowledge can be standardized and shared across a broad community of knowledge workers. One example domain where this approach has been successful is [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goble|first1=Carole|title=State of the nation in data integration for bioinformatics|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=2008|volume=41|issue=5|pages=687693|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046408000178|accessdate=5 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death''' (Polish: '''''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią''''', Latin: '''''De morte prologus, Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum''''') is a late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] dialog in verse, written probably in the early 15th century. Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death is now regarded as one of the most important examples of [[medieval poetry]] in the [[Polish language]]. The work is patterned after a 12th century [[Latin]] poem ''Dialogus mortis cum homine'', and other Latin language publications, popular in medieval Europe. Its author is unknown, but after discovering the complete, printed version from 1542 some [[historian]]s speculate that [[Mikołaj Rej]] has re-written the original text for print.

One of the unique features of the work is its use of [[humour]]. The dialog mocks monks and priests, inn-keepers, fat women, dishonest physicians and unjust judges.

== Versions ==

The original version of the [[dialogue]] has been lost; what remains is an incomplete copy from ca. 1463-1465, belonging to Mikołaj of Mirzyniec (Mikołaj z Mirzyńca). The ending of the work was known due to its 16th century [[Russian language|Russian]] [[translation]]. It has 498 lines, and presents everyday life scenes of members of different social classes of 15th century [[Poland]].

An unknown printed edition of ''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią'' (''Master Polikarp’s Dialogue with Death'') from 1542 (Cracow, Maciej [[Scharffenberg family|Scharffenberg]]) has been discovered in one of the European university libraries.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://instytutksiazki.pl/en/news,2,professor-wydra%E2%80%99s-great-discovery,1307.html | |title=Professor Wydra’s Great Discovery | publisher = The Polish Book Institute | date= July 3, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was made by Professor Wiesław Wydra from the Institute of Polish Philology at [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] in [[Poznań]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; In the contrast to the previously known version of the dialogue from the Płock manuscript, this text has been preserved in its entirety.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; This discovery, with a complete Polish text of 918 verses, makes it the biggest and the most important event in Polish language and literature scholarship for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/full-text-of-polish-literatures-oldest-masterpiece-found-1138 | title=Full text of Polish literature’s oldest masterpiece found | last=Nowacki | first = Aleksander | publisher = The first news | date= July 14, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical edition of the discovered text has been published by prof.

The '''Master of Animals''' or '''Lord of Animals''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in ancient art showing a human between and grasping two [[confronted animals]]. It is very widespread in the art of the Ancient Near East and Egypt.  The figure is normally male, but not always, the animals may be realistic or fantastical, and the figure may have animal elements such as horns, or an animal upper body.  Unless he is shown with specific divine attributes, he is typically described as a hero, although what the motif represented to the cultures which created the works probably varies greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Micah (ed), ''From the Banks of the Euphrates: Studies in Honor of Alice Louise Slotsky'', pp. 174-177, 2008, Eisenbrauns, {{ISBN|1575061449}}, 9781575061443, [https://books.google.com/books?id=edVOGJKa7XUC&amp;pg=PA176 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The motif is so widespread and visually effective that many depictions were probably conceived as decoration with only a vague meaning attached to them.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Animals is the "favorite motif of [[Achaemenian]] official [[cylinder seal|seal]]s", but the figures in these cases should be understood as the king.&lt;ref&gt;Teissier, Beatrice, ''Ancient Near Eastern Cylinder Seals from the Marcopolic Collection'', p. 46, 1984, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0520049276}}, 9780520049277, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qu7WeaZA3VUC&amp;pg=PA46 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure may be standing, found from the 4th millennium BC, or kneeling on one knee, these latter found from the 3rd millennium BC.  They are usually shown looking frontally, but in Assyrian pieces typically shown from the side.  Sometimes the animals are clearly alive, whether fairly passive and tamed, or still struggling or attacking. In other pieces they may represent dead hunter's prey.&lt;ref&gt;"Horse Cheekpiece" by "OWM", in ''Notable Acquisitions, 1980-1981'', pp. 7-8, 1981, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870992848}}, 9780870992841, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qG1_i36TbwC&amp;pg=PA7 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other associated representations show a figure controlling or "taming" a single animal, usually to the right of the figure. But the many representations of heroes or kings killing an animal are distinguished from these.&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The motif takes pride of place at the top of the famous [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] in the Louvre, an ivory and flint knife dating from the [[Gerzeh culture|Naqada II d]] period of [[prehistoric Egypt|Egyptian prehistory]], which began c.3450 BC. Here a figure in Mesopotamian dress, often taken to be a god, grapples with two lions. It has been connected to the famous [[Pashupati seal]] from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500-1500 BC), showing a figure seated in a [[yoga]]-like posture, with a horned headress (or horns), and surrounded by animals.&lt;ref&gt;Werness, 270&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is related to a figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], who sits with legs part-crossed, has antlers, is surrounded by animals and grasps a snake in one hand and a [[torc]] in the other.  This famous and puzzling object probably dates to 200 BC, or possibly as late as 300 AD, and though found in [[Denmark]] was perhaps made in [[Thrace]].

A form of the master of animals motif appears on an Early Medieval belt buckle from Kanton Wallis, Switzerland, which depicts the biblical figure of Daniel between two lions&lt;ref&gt;Gaimster, Marit. 1998. Vendel period bracteates on Gotland. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid from the Sutton Hoo burial]] of about 620 AD has two plaques with a man between two wolves, and the motif is common in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and related Early Medieval styles, where the animals generally remain aggressive. Other notable examples of the motif in Germanic art include one of the [[Torslunda plates]], and helmets from [[Vendel]] and [[Valsgärde]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaimster, Marit. 1998. Vendel period bracteates on Gotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[art of Mesopotamia]] the motif appears very early, usually with a "naked hero", for example at [[Uruk]] in the [[Uruk period]] (c. 4000 to 3100 BC), but was "outmoded in Mesopotamia by the seventh century BC".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 30-31 (Uruk), 75, 78-79, 347 (2nd quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Luristan bronze]]s the motif is extremely common, and often highly stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 343-347&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of its composition the Master of Animals motif compares with another very common motif in the art of the [[ancient Near East]] and Mediterranean, that of two [[confronted animals]] flanking and grazing on a [[Tree of Life]].

Although such figures are not all, or even usually, deities, the term can also be a generic name for a number of deities from a variety of cultures with close relationships to the animal kingdom or in part animal form (in cultures where that is not the norm). These figures control animals, usually wild ones, and are responsible for their continued reproduction and availability for hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel&lt;/ref&gt;  They sometimes also have female equivalents, the so-called [[Mistress of the Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 303-304&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mesopotamian examples may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  They may all have a [[Stone Age]] precursor who was probably a hunter's deity.  Many relate to the [[horned deity]] of the [[Hunting|hunt]], another common type, typified by [[Cernunnos]], and a variety of stag, bull, ram and goat gods. Horned gods are not universal however, and in some cultures bear gods, like [[Arktos]] might take the role, or even the more [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] deities who lead the [[Wild Hunt]]. Such figures are also often referred to as 'Lord of the forest'* or 'Lord of the mountain'.

''[[Potnia Theron]]'', a phrase used by [[Homer]] meaning "Mistress of the Animals" is used for early Greek depictions of goddesses, usually [[Artemis]], holding animals. The Greek god shown as "Master of Animals" is usually [[Apollo]], the god of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 303-304, 308&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] has the epithet [[Pashupati]] meaning the "Lord of cattle", and these figures may derive from a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European deity]] or [[archetype]].&lt;ref&gt;Werness, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapter 39 of the [[Book of Job]] has been interpreted as an assertion of the God of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as Master of Animals.&lt;ref&gt;Doak, Brian R., ''Consider Leviathan: Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job'', 2014, Fortress Press, {{ISBN|145148951X}}, 9781451489514, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QB7qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235 google books]; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2039&amp;version=NIV Job:39, NIV]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile Teaching Laboratories ==
[[File:Mobile Teaching Laboratory.jpg|thumbnail|A mobile teaching laboratory in rural Uganda, operated by [http://www.tasteforscience.org The African Science Truck Experience]. The vehicle contains practical science equipment which is transported between a number of schools.]]
A novel use of the mobile laboratory is in science education. In some cases, the mobile laboratory travels to schools, museums, and other community organizations, providing the schools with educational resources which they otherwise lack. The mobile laboratory coalition is a loose partnership of groups that provide such services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilelabcoalition.org Mobile Laboratory Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, students must also travel to the mobile lab, such as when the lab takes the form of a boat or a train.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nysunworks.org/?page_id=9 New York Science Barge]&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile laboratories have recently been gaining favor from the [[NIH|National Institutes of Health]], in the form of the particular mobile laboratories such as the [[Biobus]] and the Boston University MobileLab, as a way to develop knowledge and understanding regarding biotechnology and medicine amongst the United States population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/ncrr_reporter/fall2007/cover.asp NCRR article on mobile biology laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of mobile teaching labs exists outside the USA as well with examples,  in the UK and in African countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tasteforscience.org/ The African Science Truck Experience (TASTE)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK [[Institute of Physics]] is touring secondary schools with their Lab in a Lorry. This is a large articulated truck with three small laboratories. In these, pupils can learn about the use of Physics in Medicine, and do hands-on experiments with light and sound using good physics lab equipment. These are guided by local volunteers and an IoP scientist. Volunteers usually have an interest in general science, or come from a science background. The project has the backing of the [[British Science Association]], the [[STEMNET]] Ambassadors Scheme, and sponsors such as [[EDF Energy]].

'''Mona Kim''' (born March 15, 1967) is a Korean-American designer born in South Korea and educated in the United States. Kim is a multidisciplinary design consultant and a visual artist for cultural and commercial projects ([[Mona Kim Projects]]).

Through synthesizing words, images, public spaces, and technology, Kim has directed award-winning projects for her clients: environmental design for museum exhibitions; advertising campaigns for fashion and beauty; branded art installations; interactive sensorial spaces; direction and scriptwriting for audio-visual installations; editorial design.

==Life and career==
Kim is a [[Carnegie Mellon University]] graduate with BFA degree with Honors in Design. She had been selected by [[IBM]] Strategic Design branch during her last year in the university to collaborate with leaders in the design field such as [[Edward Tufte]] and Sam Lucente.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hindo |first=Brian |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/nov2005/id20051101_609886.htm |title='The Front Lines' of Innovation |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=November 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Kim moved to Italy which had significantly influenced her work and life philosophy to date. In Milan, she had worked with the late [[Ettore Sottsass]] and had been introduced to the instinctual approach to design.

In 1993, Kim moved to New York City where she had begun to expand her work into the fashion &amp; beauty sector, working on advertising campaigns for fashion, beauty, and technology for clients and agencies such as [[Bloomingdales]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Coty, Inc.|Coty]], [[Kenneth Cole Productions|Kenneth Cole]], and Arnell Group, as well as working overseas for fashion houses in Italy such as [[Mandarina Duck]] and [[Trussardi]] on the collection side.

During this time, Kim also started to design environments and "experiential spaces" for thematic museums and exhibitions. Using her influence from fashion and advertising background, and merging it with an intellectual approach to communicating socio-political information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-org.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Vicenc/Villatoro/defiende/exposicion/Voces/tiene/ideas/politicas/explicitas/elpepiespcat/20040505elpcat_21/Tes?print=1 |title=El País Article |publisher=Org.elpais.com |accessdate=January 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902185204/http://www-org.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Vicenc/Villatoro/defiende/exposicion/Voces/tiene/ideas/politicas/explicitas/elpepiespcat/20040505elpcat_21/Tes?print=1 |archivedate=September 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; her award-winning projects&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segd.org/design-awards/2005-design-awards/voices.html |title=2005 Honor Awards, Society for Environmental Graphic Design, "Voices" |publisher=Segd.org |accessdate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/gdesign/winners04.htm#choose/ |title=2004 Good Design Award, Chicago Athenaeum, for "Voices" Exhibition |publisher=Chi-athenaeum.org |accessdate=January 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721195728/http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/gdesign/winners04.htm#choose/ |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are described to be highly impactful, with innovative &amp; seamless synthesis of images, space, and message, that boldly engage the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">'''Nasîhatnâme''' ({{lang-ota|نصيحت نامه}}, ''Naṣīḥat-nāme'') were a type of guidance letter for [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] sultans, similar to [[mirrors for princes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Congress on the Social and Economic History of Turkey|year=1990|publisher=Varia Turcica|isbn=9780941469012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They draw on a variety of historical and religious sources, and were influenced by the governance of previous empires such as the Seljuk Turks or the Mongols, as well as by early Muslim history and by contemporary events.

==History==
Nasîhatnâme became common in the sixteenth century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=The Ottoman Empire and the world around it|year=2011|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-122-9|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but built on earlier works such as the Kutadgu Bilig (''Knowledge of Prosperity''), written in 1070 by Yusuf Has Hacip. Early influences include the inşa literature of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ePmqBgAAQBAJ|title = The Culture of Letter-Writing in Pre-Modern Islamic Society|last = Gully|first = Adrian|date = 2008-02-07|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|isbn = 9780748633746|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some refer to [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Good Old Days"&gt;{{cite journal|last=İnan|first=Kenan|title=Remembering the Good Old Days: the Ottoman Nasihatname [Advice  Letters] Literature of the 17th Century|journal=Ideology, Society and Values|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, nasîhatnâme are different from [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] ''Chronographia'', and were written for a different audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ottomans and the Balkans: A Discussion of Historiography|year=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004119024|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasîhatnâme were even commissioned by aspirants to Ottoman government - including, in one case, by the [[Phanariot]] [[Alexandros Skarlatou Kallimaki]], the probable father of [[Skarlatos Voyvodas Alexandrou Kallimaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philiou|title=Biography of an Empire: Governing Ottomans in an Age of Revolution|year=2011|isbn=9780520266339|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a sense of imperial decline began to affect the content of these texts; more than just advocating a return to some golden age (i.e. [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]) they highlighted specific systemic problems in the empire - including nepotism, revolts, military defeat, and corrupt [[Janissary|Janissaries]].&lt;ref name="Good Old Days"/&gt;

==Content==
Nasîhatnâme typically state a clear moral reason for why they are written and presented to leaders; whether piety, or morality, or realpolitik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comité international d'études pré-ottomanes et ottomanes, VIth Symposium|journal=Varia Turcica|year=1987|volume=4|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17206">'''Neuromorphology''' (from Greek νεῦρον, neuron, "nerve"; μορφή, morphé, "form"; -λογία, -logia, “study of”&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:morphology|Morphology]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:neuron|Neuron]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the study of [[nervous system]] form, shape, and structure. The study involves looking at a particular part of the nervous system from a [[Molecular biology|molecular]] and [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level and connecting it to a [[physiology|physiological]] and  [[anatomy|anatomical]] point of view. The field also explores the communications and interactions within and between each specialized section of the nervous system.
[[morphology (biology)|Morphology]] is distinct from [[morphogenesis]]. Morphology is the study of the shape and structure of biological organisms, while morphogenesis is the study of the biological development of the shape and structure of organisms. Therefore, neuromorphology focuses on the specifics of the structure of the nervous system and not the process by which the structure was developed. Neuromorphology and morphogenesis, while two different entities, are nonetheless closely linked.

== History ==
Progress in defining the morphology of nerve cells has been slow in its development.  It took nearly a century after the acceptance of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] as the basic unit of life before researchers could agree upon the shape of a [[neuron]].  It was originally thought to be an independent globular [[wiktionary:corpuscle|corpuscle]] suspended along [[nerve fibers]] that looped and coiled.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Alan |last2=Palay |first2=Sanford L. |last3=Webster |first3=Henry deF. |title=The Fine Structure of the Nervous System: Neurons and Their Supporting Cells |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=January 1991 |isbn=0-19-506571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the first successful [[microdissection]] of a whole nerve cell by [[Otto Deiters]] in 1865 that the separate [[dendrite]]s and [[axon]] could be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; At the end of the 19th century, new techniques, such as [[Golgi's method]], were developed that enabled researchers to view the whole neuron. This Golgi investigation then promoted new research in neuronal spacing by [[Ramon y Cajal]] in 1911. Further morphology research continued to develop, including dendritic morphology. In 1983 Thoroya Abdel-Maguid and David Bowsher expanded upon the golgi method and combined it with an impregnation technique which allowed them to visualize the dendrites of neurons and classify them based on their dendritic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdel-Maguid|first1=Thoroya  |last2=Bowsher|first2=David |title=Classification of neurons by dendriticbranching pattern. A categorisation based on Golgi impregnation of spinal and cranial somatic and visceral afferent and efferent cells in the adult human. |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=138 |year=1984 |pages=689–702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, myriad techniques have been developed and applied to the field of neuromorphology.

===Influence on neuron function===
Research has supported a relationship between the morphological and functional properties of neurons.  For instance, the accordance between the morphology and the functional classes of cat [[retina]]l [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]]s has been studied to show the relationship between neuron shape and function.  Orientation sensitivity and dendritic branching patterns are a few other common characteristics of neurons that researchers have noted as having an effect on neuron function.&lt;ref name="Costa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Luciano da Fontoura |last2=Campos |first2=Andrea G. |last3=Estrozi |first3=Leandro F. |last4=Rios-Filho |first4=Luiz G. |last5=Bosco |first5=Alejandra |title=A Biologically-Motivated Approach to Image Representation and Its Application to Neuromorphology |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=1811 |year=2000 |pages=192–214 |doi=10.1007/3-540-45482-9_41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian A. Meinertzhagen et al. have recently established a connection between the genetic factors that underlie a specific neuronal structure and how these two factors then pertain to the neuron's function by examining the optic nerves in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. They assert the structure of the neuron is able to determine its function by dictating synapse formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meinertzhagen |first1= Ian A. |last2=Takemura |first2=Shin-ya |last3=Lu |first3=Zhiyuan |last4=Huang |first4=Songling |last5=Gao |first5=Shuying |last6=Ting |first6=Chun-Yuan |last7=Lee |first7=Chi-Hon |title=From Form to Function: the ways to know a neuron. |journal=Journal of Neurogenetics |volume=23 |pages=68–77 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/01677060802610604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometry of neurons often depends on the cell type and the history of received stimuli that is processed through the synapses.  The shape of a neuron often directs the neuron's function by establishing its synaptic partnerships.  However, there is also a growing evidence for [[volume transmission]], a process that involves electrochemical interactions from the whole [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name=Costa /&gt;

The axonal tree morphology is instrumental in activity modulation and information coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ofer |first1=Netanel |last2=Shefi |first2=Orit |last3=Yaari |first3=Gur |title=Branching morphology determines signal propagation dynamics in neurons |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |date=August 2017 |PMID=28827727 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09184-3 |pmc=5567046}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Development===
The development of the morphological features of neurons is governed by both [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] factors.  The neuromorphology of [[nervous tissue]] is dependent upon genes and other factors, such as [[electrical field|electric fields]], ionic waves, and [[gravity]].  Developing cells additionally impose geometrical and physical constraints upon each other.  These interactions affect the neural shape and [[synaptogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Costa |first1=Luciano da Fontoura |last2=Manoel |first2=Edson Tadeu Monteiro |last3=Fauchereau |first3=Fabien |last4=Chelly |first4=Jamel |last5=van Pelt |first5=Jaap |last6=Ramakers |first6=Ger |title=A shape analysis framework for neuromorphometry |journal=Institute of Physics Publishing |volume=13 |date=July 2002 |pages=283–310 |doi=10.1088/0954-898x/13/3/303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morphological measures and imaging applications are important for further understanding the developmental process.

== Subfields ==

===General morphology===
[[File:GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg|thumb |right |200px | A human [[Neocortex|neocortical]] [[pyramidal cell]] that has been stained using Golgi's method. The cell is named after its characteristic triangular-shaped [[Cell soma|soma]].]]

Since there is a broad range of functions performed by different types of neurons in diverse parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in the size, shape, and [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] properties of neurons.  Neurons can be found in different shapes and sizes and can be classified based upon their morphology.  The Italian scientist [[Camillo Golgi]] grouped neurons into type I and type II cells.  [[Golgi I]] neurons have long axons that can move signals over long distances, such as in [[Purkinje cells]], whereas [[Golgi II]] neurons generally have shorter axons, such as [[granule cell]]s, or are anoxonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purves |first1=Dale|title=Neuroscience |year=2001 |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |location=Sunderland |isbn=0-87893-742-0 |edition=2.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons can be morphologically characterized as [[unipolar neuron|unipolar]], [[bipolar neuron|bipolar]], or [[multipolar neuron|multipolar]].  Unipolar and [[pseudounipolar]] cells have only one [[Process (anatomy)|process]] extending from the cell body.  Bipolar cells have a two processes extending from the [[cell body]] and multipolar cells have three or more processes extending towards and away from the cell body.

=== Theoretical neuromorphology ===
{{Main article|Theoretical neuromorphology}}
Theoretical neuromorphology is a branch of neuromorphology focused on the mathematical description of the shape, structure and connectivity of the nervous system.

===Gravitational neuromorphology===
Gravitational neuromorphology studies the effects of altered [[gravity]] on the architecture of the [[central nervous system|central]], [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]], and [[autonomic nervous system]]s. This subfield aims to expand the current understanding of the adaptive capabilities of nervous systems, and specifically examines how environmental effects can alter nervous system structure and function. In this case environmental manipulations generally include exposing neurons to either [[hypergravity]] or [[microgravity]]. It is a subset of [[gravitational biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krasnov |first1=IB |title=Gravitational neuromorphology |journal=Advanced Space Biology Medicine |volume=4 |date=December 1994 |pages=85–110 |PMID=7757255 |doi=10.1016/s1569-2574(08)60136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research methods and techniques ==
A variety of techniques have been used to study neuromorphology, including [[confocal microscopy]], design-based [[stereology]], neuron tracing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oztas |first1=Emin |title=Neuronal tracing |journal=Neuroanatomy |volume=2 |pages=2–5 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neuron reconstruction.  Current innovations and future research include [[virtual microscopy]], automated stereology, [[cortical map]]ping, map guided automated [[Anterograde tracing|neuron tracing]], microwave techniques, and network analysis. Of the currently used techniques for studying neuromorphology, design-based stereology and confocal microscopy are the two most preferred methods. A complete database of neuronal morphology called the NeuroMorpho Database also exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Luciano Da Fontoura |last2=Zawadzki |first2=Krissia |last3=Miazaki |first3=Mauro |last4=Viana |first4=Matheus P. |last5=Taraskin |first5=Sergei N. |title=Unveiling the Neuromorphological Space |journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=4 |date=December 2010 |PMID=21160547 |doi=10.3389/fncom.2010.00150 |pmc=3001740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design-based stereology ===
Design-based stereology is one of the most prominent methods for mathematically extrapolating a 3-D form from a given 2-D form. It is currently the leading technique in [[medical research|biomedical research]] for analyzing 3-D structures.&lt;ref name=Lemmens&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lemmens |first1=Marijke A.M. |last2=Steinbusch |first2=Harry W.M. |last3=Rutten |first3=Bart P.F. |last4=Schmitz |first4=Christoph |title=Advanced microscopy techniques for quantitative analysis in neuromorphology and neuropathology research: current status and requirements for the future |journal=Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=199–209 |year=2010 |PMID=20600825 |doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2010.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design-based stereology is a newer stereology technique that examines morphology that has been predefined and designed. This technique contrasts with the older method, model-based stereology, which utilized previously determined models as a guide. The more current design-based stereology allows researchers to probe the morphology of neurons without having to make assumptions about their size, shape, orientation or distribution. Design-based stereology also gives researchers more freedom and flexibility as model-based stereology is only effective if the models are truly representative of the object being studied, while design-based stereology is not constrained in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is design-based stereology|url=http://www.stereology.info/design-based-stereology/|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confocal microscopy ===
{{Main article|Confocal microscopy}}
[[File:Confocalprinciple in English.svg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of how confocal microscopy works.]]
Confocal microscopy is the [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] procedure of choice for examining neuron structures as it produces sharp images with improved [[Display resolution|resolution]] and decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. The specific way this microscopy works allows one to look at one confocal plane at a time, which is optimal when viewing neuronal structures. Other more conventional  forms of microscopy simply do not allow one to visualize all neuronal structures, especially those that are subcellular. Recently, some researchers have actually been combining design-based stereology and confocal microscopy to further their investigations into the specific neuronal cellular structures.

===Cortical mapping===
[[Cortical map]]ping is defined as the process of characterizing specific regions in the brain based on either anatomical or functional features. Current brain atlases are not definitive or homogenous enough to portray specific structural details. Recent advances in functional brain imaging and [[statistical analysis]] may however prove to be sufficient in the future. A recent development in this field called the Gray Level Index (GLI) method allows for more objective identification of cortical regions via [[algorithm]]s. The GLI is a standardized method that allows researchers to determine neuron density. It is specifically defined as the ratio of area covered by Nissl-stained elements to area covered by unstained elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casanova |first1=Manuel F. |last2=Buxhoeveden |first2=Daniel P. |last3=Switala |first3=Andrew E. |last4=Roy |first4=Emil |title=Neuronal Density and Architecture (Gray Level Index) in the Brains of Autistic Patients. |journal=Journal of Child Neurology |volume=17 |pages=515–21 |year=2002 | doi = 10.1177/088307380201700708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated cortical mapping techniques are still in the process of being developed and this field will most likely see an exponential growth in mapping methods in the near future.

== Clinical applications ==
Neuromorphology has been used as a new method of exploring the underlying cause of many [[neurological disorder]]s, and has been included in the clinical study of various [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases, [[mental disorder]]s, [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], and dysfunctions due to brain damage. Researchers have been using neuromorphological techniques to not only study the damage but also ways to regenerate the damage nerve through ways like axon growth stimulation.
Neuromophology has been used to study [[optical nerve]] damage, specifically looking at [[lesion]]s and [[Atrophy|atrophies]]. Researchers have also examined and identified the neuromorphology of the human penis to better understand the role the sympathetic nervous system plays in achieving an erection. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=George |last2=McConnell |first2=Joann |last3=Lipshultz|first3=Larry I. |last4=Corriere|first4=Joseph Jr. |last5=Wood|first5=Joe |title=Neuromorphology and Neuropharmacology of the Human Penis.|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=506–513 |year=1980 |PMID=7356692 |doi=10.1172/JCI109694 |pmc=371389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current and future research ==

===Computational neuromorphology===
Computational neuromorophology examines neurons and their substructures by cutting them into slices and studying these different subsections. It also describes the neuromorphological space as a 3-D space. This allows researchers to understand the size of specific neuronal components. Additionally, the 3-D imaging helps researchers comprehend how the neuron transmits information within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trinidad|first=Pablo|title=Computational Neuromorphology|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~trinidad/p2/index.htm|publisher=University of Texas at Dallas|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102094212/http://utdallas.edu/%7Etrinidad/p2/index.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual microscopy ===
Virtual microscopy would allow researchers to obtain images with a decreased amount of imaging sessions, thus preserving the integrity of the tissue and decrease the possibility the [[Fluorescent labelling|fluorescent dyes]] fading during imaging. This method would additionally give researchers abilities to visualize currently unobtainable data, such as rare cell types and the spatial allocation of cells in a specific brain region.&lt;ref name=Lemmens /&gt; Virtual microscopy would essentially allow for the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of all images obtained, therefore preventing [[Degeneration|deterioration]] of the data. This digitization could also potentially permit researchers to create a [[database]] to share and store their data.

{{Music Education|major}}

The '''Orff Schulwerk''', or simply the '''Orff Approach''', is a developmental approach used in [[music education]]. It combines [[music]], movement, [[drama]], and [[speech]] into lessons that are similar to [[child]]'s world of play. It was developed by the [[Germany|German]] composer [[Carl Orff]] (1895–1982) and colleague [[Gunild Keetman]] during the 1920s. Carl Orff worked until the end of his life to continue the development and spread of his teaching method. 

The Orff Approach is now used throughout the world to teach students in a natural and comfortable environment. The term "schulwerk" is [[German language|German]] for (literally) "school work" or "schooling", in this regard in the area of [[music]].

==Foundations==
The Orff Approach of [[music education]] uses very rudimentary forms of everyday activity for the purpose of music creation by music students. The Orff Approach is a "child-centered way of learning" music education that treats music as a basic system like [[language]] and believes that just as every child can learn language without formal instruction so can every child learn music by a gentle and friendly approach.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Patricia Sherman. Musician and Teacher. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often called "Elemental Music making" because the materials needed to teach students are "basic, natural, and close to a child’s world of thought and fantasy".&lt;ref name="Shamrock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shamrock|first=Mary|title=Orff- Schulwerk: An Integrated Method|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=83|issue=6|date=May 1997|pages=41–44|jstor=3399024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the Orff Approach to effectively work teachers must create an atmosphere that is similar to a child’s world of play. This allows participating children to feel comfortable learning a new and often abstract musical skill, greater exploration of a [[musical instrument]] or musical skill, and keeps a student from feeling [[evaluate]]d or judged by his or her peers and teachers. A child participating in an Orff classroom does not feel the pressure of [[performing]] that is often in tandem with music because every student in an Orff classroom is treated as an equal, even when performing a solo. 

The Orff Approach is used by teachers to encourage their students to enjoy making music as individuals as well as in groups. Children realize the joys of [[Group (sociology)|group]] co-ordination and cohesion. It also involves the participation of other adults and parents in music making. Thus it brings the role of [[parent]] in child education in a central position. From a teacher’s aspect Orff-Schulwerk is also a process of breaking down each activity into its simplest form and then presenting those steps one at a time to eventually become a completed performance.

In the Orff Approach "all concepts are learned by ‘doing'".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;"The Orff Approach to Music Education" By Gloria Day&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the Orff Approach learn music by experiencing and participating in the different musical lessons and activities. These lessons stimulate not only the paraxial concepts of music like rhythm and tempo, but also the aesthetic qualities of music. “Orff activities awaken the child’s total awareness” and “sensitize the child’s awareness of space, time, form, line, color, design, and mood- aesthetic data that musicians are acutely aware of, yet find hard to explain to musical novices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=Susan|title=Orff- Schulwerk Teaches Musical Responsiveness|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=68|issue=7|date=March 1982|pages=42–43|jstor=3395939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Simply Music]] or the [[Suzuki Method]], the Orff Schulwerk approach is not a method. There is no systematic stepwise procedure to be followed.  There are fundamental principles, clear models and basic processes that all intuitive and creative teachers use to guide their organization of musical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Orff." Miranda, Martina MENC Meeting, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

The music generated in the Orff Approach is largely improvisational and uses original tonal constructions that build a sense of confidence and interest in the process of creative thinking. Students of the Orff Approach sing, play instruments, and dance alone as well as in groups. Songs are usually short, contain [[ostinato]]s, are within singing range, can be manipulated to be played in a round or ABA form. "Music is chosen with strong nationalistic flavor, being related to folk songs and music of the child’s own heritage".&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; Music can also be anything from nursery rhymes to songs that are invented by the children themselves. Orff-Schulwerk music is largely based on simple but forceful variations on rhythmic patterns. This makes for very simple and beautiful musical forms, which are easily learned by young children, and is also useful for adults and thus it has a universal appeal.  Composer [[David Hewson (composer)|David Hewson]] was exposed to Orff Schulwerk and this influence helped to shape a lot of his later music.

The music is largely modal, beginning with pentatonic (both major and minor) scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orff - Keetman|title=Music for Children Vol I|year=1958|publisher=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt; (English version adapted by Margaret Murray) The drone or bordun, is quickly established as the ground bass that supports most melodies and melodic ostinati add energy and colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodkin|first=Doug|title=Play, Sing and Dance|year=2004|publisher=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II in Part One, covers hexachordal (added fa)melodies over Major Drone Bass Triads, and then seven notes: Ionian mode. Note, this is not major scale, as the drone bass enforces a non-functional harmony. Parallel thirds and sixths (paraphony) are used liberally here. Part Two introduces the use of triads as following: I - ii, and some I - vi.

Goodkin (p172) discusses the progression of the volumes:  I-II-III-IV-V as opposed to I-II-IV-III-V. Volume III introduces Major Dominant and Subdominant triads (That is to say: functional harmony). However Volume IV can be viewed as more logically the next step as it introduces Dorian, Aeolian and Phrygian modes with similar shifting drones and triads to those found previously in Vol II.

Vol IV, Part One: Minor-Drone Bass Triads. Aeolian, Dorian and Phrygian mode, i-ii shifting drones and triads. Part Two: Tonic and Leading Note triads, i-IV and decoration of the third.

Vol III Major Dominant and Subdominant Triads. This harmonic world is more challenging for children and improvising than the modes, hence the importance of leaving until skills have developed appropriately.

Volume V follows III, but explores Minor Dominant and Subdominant Chords.

And finally, almost as an afterthought, Paralipomena which explores the worlds of Lydian I-II, and Mixolydian I-VII.

When interesting original music has been generated by the groups or individual child a desire to record it may arise. Thus, the desire to develop musical skills emerges by itself and the child may be intrinsically propelled to learn formal music.

==Instruments and tools==
[[File:Intrumentarium Orff-Schulwerkde la société Studio 49.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Some typical teaching instruments ''Orff-Schulwerk'']]
Orff considered the percussive [[rhythm]] as a natural basic form of [[human]] expression. Carl Orff and colleague [[Gunild Keetman]] co-composed much of the music for the five volume series, ''Music for Children.''  These volumes, first published in 1950, are still available and used today. Music played on Orff instruments is often very simple and easy to play even for first time musicians.

Some of the instruments within the approach include miniature [[xylophones]], [[marimbas]], [[glockenspiels]], and [[metallophones]]; all of which have removable bars, resonating columns to project the sound, and are easily transported and stored. Orff teachers also use different sized [[drums]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], and non- pitched percussion instruments "to round out the songs that are sung and played".&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; The Orff approach also requires that children sing, chant, clap, dance, pat, and snap fingers along to melodies and rhythms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;

==Spread==

In 1923 Carl Orff met [http://www.orff.de/en/life/educational-works/guenther-school.html Dorothee Günther] while working at a theater in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. Günther "believed that most students did not get enough chances to do art and music and movement activities".&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;Gray, Esther. "Orff- Schulwerk: Where Did it Come From?" The Orff Beat-Centenary Issue XXIV (June 1995). Victorian Orff Schulwerk Association. 3 May 2009 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosa.org/paul/orff_history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915154530/http://www.vosa.org/paul/orff_history.htm |archivedate=15 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her extensive background in gymnastics and the arts Gunter was able to open the Gunter-Schule in 1924. Even though [[Carl Orff]] never worked with the students of the Gunter-Schule directly, this was the first institution to teach what would later be known as the Orff Approach.

Students of the Günther-Schule later went on to be dancers and teachers of note. One of these students, Gunild Keetman, began as a student and became a teacher at the school. The Gunter-Schule originally only taught older students; however, Keetman later worked on developing the ideas of the school to teach younger children as well. Together she and [[Carl Orff]] created the five volume series "Music for Children" which is still used by teachers today. The Gunter-Schule ran until 1944 when [[Nazis]] confiscated it. In 1945 the building was destroyed in an Allied bomb attack and all materials (instruments, costumes, photographs, and its library and archives) were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

After the war, two serendipitous events brought Orff's approach back into the educational field.  A series of [[radio]] programs aimed at children was broadcast in [[Bavaria]]. Orff wrote the music and re-united with Keetman to work on these broadcasts. The second event was the Mozartariums' request to have Keetman teach classes to children between 8 and 10 years old. Traude Schrattenecker who was also a graduate of the Gunter-Schule, joined Keetman in running this school.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

There are Orff Schulwerk associations in different countries across the [[world]] including [[Germany]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Korea]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]], [[France]], [[Finland]] and [[New Zealand]]. All of these organisations promote the teachings of [[Carl Orff]] and [[Gunild Keetman]] and the spread of the Approach. Through all of these organizations teachers interested in teaching the Orff Approach can become certified in the Approach.

==The American model ==

The American Orff-Schulwerk Association offers three different levels of training, each of which takes 60 hours to complete. Level one focuses on the "necessary skills to plan and implement a variety of Orff Schulwerk [[music]] and movement activities in the classroom." "Levels two and three are concerned with development of conceptual understanding of music and movement elements as they are presented in the Schulwerk elemental music context, as well as the skill needed to implement them".&lt;ref&gt;American Orff-Schulwerk. Association&lt;/ref&gt;

In America there are four stages in the Orff Approach:  [[imitation]], exploration, [[improvisation]], and composition.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Through imitation, the teacher, group leader, or even the students perform for the class and the class in turn repeats what was played for them. Exploration allows students to seek out the musical aspects that the Orff instruments offer and explore [[aural]]/[[Mouth|oral]] skills and the motions and expressions that the body is capable of. Literacy is taught by learning musical notation and becoming familiar with forms of music like [[rondo]] and ABA. Improvisation is the act of creating something, especially music, without prior preparation.&lt;ref name="Shamrock"/&gt; To improvise, a student must have "a preliminary knowledge and comprehension of concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Judith|title=Orff-Based Improvisation|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=66|issue=5|date=January 1980|pages=58–61|jstor=3395777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the Orff Approach learn to create their own melodies in a comfortable environment that allows for mistakes and promotes creativity.

==Orff Schulwerk in Aotearoa/New Zealand==

[http://www.orffnz.org Orff New Zealand Aotearoa (ONZA)] is a professional society dedicated to the promotion of the Orff Schulwerk approach in New Zealand. The organisation is a member of the [http://www.orff-schulwerk-forum-salzburg.org Orff Schulwerk Forum Salzburg]. In association with the [https://education.waikato.ac.nz/about/departments/arts-and-language-department/orff-schulwerk/ University of Waikato], ONZA offers a four-tiered course of study in the Orff approach, which includes practical workshops and critical investigation.

==Other applications==

The Orff Approach was originally intended to teach music to children but because of the different benefits that it offers with [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[dexterity]], and [[concentration]] the technique is often used to teach individuals with [[special needs]]. The simplicity of the technique allows all ranges of [[handicapped]] students to participate in the learning process. [[Mentally handicapped]] students can easily perform the tasks without fear of being ridiculed or being left behind. The [[visually impaired]]/[[blindness|blind]] who tend to have "hesitant, jerky, and over controlled" movements because they "often breathe quite shallowly" can use the different breathing and movement exercises to relax their body and breathing.&lt;ref name="Bitcon"&gt;Bitcon, Carol Hampton.

Santa Ana, CA: Rosha Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Students with a [[hearing impairment]]  can use the Orff Approach by feeling the [[vibrations]] that are created by different [[musical instrument|instruments]]. Since music is mostly resilient, students who have had injuries that have mentally impaired them can use the Approach as a form of [[therapy]]. Even elderly individuals who often become weak with old age can use the Orff Approach to help with [[memory]], [[dexterity]], and [[agility]].&lt;ref name="Bitcon"/&gt;

'''Promise of Paradise: Early Chinese Buddhist Sculpture''' is a rotating exhibition at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]], the Smithsonian's museum of Asian art. The exhibition opened in December 2012, showcasing Chinese Buddhist Art influenced by [[Buddhism]].

Buddhism is founded on the religious principles and practices expounded by Siddhartha Gautama (circa 563–483 BCE), a spiritual teacher from the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Through a long period of meditation he cultivated a mind free of ignorance, greed, and hatred. Thus enlightened and freed from the cycle of rebirth, he became known as the Buddha, the "awakened one" in Sanskrit, and Shakyamuni, literally Sage of the Shakyas, after his clan group. Missionaries conveyed his teachings from India across Central Asia to northwest China by 100 CE, where the faith ultimately prospered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

As Buddhism developed, paths to spiritual understanding multiplied; additional deities and disciplines were identified to offer different kinds of guidance to enlightenment. Representations of four different Buddhas—Shakyamuni (the Historical Buddha), Prabutaratna (Buddha of the Remote Past), Amitabha (Buddha of the Western Paradise), and Vairochana (the Cosmic Buddha)—along with divinities such as Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, and Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future are featured. In keeping with their Indian origins, they are frequently referred to by their Sanskrit names and the names they were given in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these images were created from the sixth to the eighth century, when Buddhism was widely followed in China and styles of religious sculptures rapidly evolved. During this period, gilt bronze images were made for domestic altars while more monumental stone figures were created for large freestanding temple buildings and man-made cave chapels. Although they are now removed from their original context, these icons still represent specific Buddhist teachings. Commissioned by emperors and commoners, they all convey the enduring appeal of the promise of paradise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8050">[[File:Centrifugal governor.png|thumb|The [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]] is an early classic example of proportional control. The balls rise as speed increases, which closes the valve, until a balance is achieved between demand and the proportional gain of the linkage and valve.]]
'''Proportional control''', in engineering and process control, is a type of linear [[feedback]] [[control system]] in which a correction is applied to the controlled variable which is proportional to the difference between the desired value (set point, SP) and the measured value (process value,  PV). Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl and the [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]].  

The proportnal control concept is more complex than an [[on–off control]] system like a bi-metallic domestic [[thermostat]], but simpler than a [[PID controller|proportional–integral–derivative]] (PID) control system used in something like an automobile [[cruise control]]. On–off control will work where the overall system has a relatively long response time, but can result in instability if the system being controlled has a rapid response time. Proportional control overcomes this by modulating the output to the controlling device, such as a [[control valve]] at a level which avoids instability, but applies correction as fast as practicable by applying the optimum quantity of proportional gain.

A drawback of proportional control is that it cannot eliminate the residual SP − PV error in processes with compensation e.g. temperature control, as it requires an error to generate a proportional output. To overcome this the [[PI controller]] was devised, which uses a proportional term (P) to remove the gross error, and an integral term (I) to eliminate the residual offset error by integrating the error over time to produce an "I" component for the controller output.

==Theory==
In the proportional control algorithm, the controller output is proportional to the error signal, which is the difference between the [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and the [[process variable]]. In other words, the output of a proportional controller is the multiplication product of the error signal and the proportional gain.

This can be mathematically expressed as,

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}} = K_p\,{e(t)+p0}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;p0&lt;/math&gt;: Controller output with zero error.
* &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;: Output of the proportional controller
* &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;: Proportional gain
* &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt;: Instantaneous process error at time ''t''.  &lt;math&gt;e(t)=SP - PV&lt;/math&gt;
* ''SP'': Set point
* ''PV'': Process variable
Constraints:  In a real plant, actuators have physical limitations that can be expressed as constraints on &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; may be bounded between −1 and +1 if those are the maximum output limits.

Qualifications:  It is preferable to express &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; as a unitless number.  To do this, we can express &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as a ratio with the span of the instrument.  This span is in the same units as error (e.g. C degrees) so the ratio has no units.

==Development of control block diagrams==
[[File:Simple feedback control loop2.png|thumb|Simple feedback control loop2]]
Proportional control dictates &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_c = k_c}}&lt;/math&gt;. From the block diagram shown, assume that ''r'', the setpoint, is the flowrate into a tank and ''e'' is ''error'', which is the difference between setpoint and measured process output. &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_p}},&lt;/math&gt; is process transfer function; the input into the block is flow rate and output is tank level. 

The output as a function of the setpoint, ''r'', is known as the ''closed-loop transfer function''.
&lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_{cl}}} = \frac{\mathit{g_{p}g_{c}}}{1 + g_{p}g_{c}},&lt;/math&gt; If the poles of &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_{cl}}},&lt;/math&gt; are stable, then the closed-loop system is stable.

==Offset error==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|300px|Flow control loop. If only a proportional controller, then there's always an offset between SP and PV.]]
Proportional control cannot eliminate the offset error, which is the difference between the desired value and the actual value, SP − PV error, as it requires an error to generate an output. When a disturbance (deviation from existing state) occurs in the process value being controlled, any corrective control action, based purely on Proportional Control, will always leave out the error between the next steady state and the desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]], and result in a residual error called the offset error. This error will increase as greater process demand is put on the system, or by increasing the set point.

Consider an object suspended by a spring as a simple proportional control.  The spring will attempt to maintain the object in a certain location despite disturbances which may temporarily displace it.  [[Hooke's law]] tells us that the spring applies a corrective force that is proportional to the object's displacement.  While this will tend to hold the object in a particular location, the absolute resting location of the object will vary if its mass is changed.  This difference in resting location is the offset error.

Imagine the same spring and object in a weightless environment.  In this case, the spring will tend to hold the object in the same location regardless of its mass.  There is no offset error in this case because the proportional action is not working against anything in the steady state.

==Proportional band==
The proportional band is the band of controller output over which the final control element (a control valve, for instance) will move from one extreme to another. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt; PB = \frac{100}{K_p}\ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;, the proportional gain, is very high, the proportional band is very small, which means that the band of controller output over which the final control element will go from minimum to maximum (or vice versa) is very small. This is the case with on–off controllers, where &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; is very high and hence, for even a small error, the controller output is driven from one extreme to another.

==Advantages==
The car advae of proportional over on–off control can be demonstrated by car speed control. An analogy to on–off control is driving a car by applying either full power or no power and varying the [[duty cycle]], to control speed. The power would be on until the target speed is reached, and then the power would be removed, so the car reduces speed. When the speed falls below the target, with a certain [[hysteresis]], full power would again be applied. It can be seen that this would obviously result in poor control and large variations in speed. The more powerful the engine; the greater the instability, the heavier the car; the greater the stability. Stability may be expressed as correlating to the [[power-to-weight ratio]] of the vehicle. 

In proportional control, the power output is always proportional to the (actual versus target speed) error. If the car is at target speed and the speed increases slightly due to a falling gradient, the power is reduced slightly, or in proportion to the change in error, so that the car reduces speed gradually and reaches the new target point with very little, if any, "overshoot", which is much smoother control than on–off control. In practice, PID controllers are used for this and the large number of control processes that require more response control than proportional alone.

'''Recursion''' occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from [[linguistics]] to [[logic]]. The most common application of recursion is in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], where a [[function (mathematics)|function]] being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

==Formal definitions==
[[File:Serpiente alquimica.jpg|thumb|[[Ouroboros]], an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:
# {{anchor|base case}}A simple '''base case''' (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
# A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case

For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:
*One's [[parent]]s are one's [[ancestor]]s (''base case'').
*The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (''recursion step'').

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a classic example of recursion:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(0)=0\text{ as base case 1,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(1)=1\text{ as base case 2,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{For all integers }n&gt;1,~\text{ Fib}(n):=\text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the [[natural number]]s by the [[Peano axioms]] can be described as: ''0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.'' By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.

Recursively defined mathematical objects include [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and especially [[fractal]]s.

There are various more tongue-in-cheek "definitions" of recursion; see [[#Recursive humor|recursive humor]].

==Informal definition==
[[File:Sourdough.jpg|thumb|Recently refreshed [[sourdough]], bubbling through [[fermentation]]: the [[recipe]] calls for some sourdough left over from the last time the same recipe was made.]]

Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves  invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.

To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.  An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.

Recursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a [[sourdough]] recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a [[maze]]. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.

==In language==
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Language Instinct|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.08.004 | title = The faculty of language: What's so special about it? | year = 2005 | last1 = Pinker | first1=Steven | last2 = Jackendoff | first2=Ray | journal = Cognition | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–236 | pmid=15694646| citeseerx = 10.1.1.116.7784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: ''Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous'', in which the sentence ''witches are dangerous'' occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.

This provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: ''Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...''. There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.

Recently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by [[Daniel Everett]] on the basis of his claims about the [[Pirahã language]]. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0140 |title=Evidence and argumentation: A reply to Everett (2009) |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |year=2009 |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |last2=Pesetsky |first2=David |last3=Rodrigues |first3=Cilene |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=671–681 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106154616/http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary [[self-reference]] can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker|first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in [[natural language semantics]]. The word ''and'', for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, ''and'' is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. 1983. In Rainer Bäuerle et al., ''Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language''. Reprinted in Paul Portner and Barbara Partee, eds. 2002. ''Formal Semantics: The Essential Readings''. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[recursive grammar]] is a formal grammar that contains recursive [[production (computer science)|production rules]].&lt;ref name="ns02"&gt;{{citation

===Recursive humor===
Recursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a [[circular definition]] or [[self-reference]], in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an [[infinite regress]]. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their [[glossary]] along the lines of:
:Recursion, ''see Recursion''.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=David|title=Essentials of Discrete Mathematics|year=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|pages=494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuwhTxCVovQC&amp;dq=recursion+joke&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation is found on page 269 in the [[Back-of-the-book index|index]]  of some editions of [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]]'s book ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''; the index entry recursively references itself ("recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269"). The earliest version of this joke was in "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of ''The C Programming Language''.

Another joke is that "To understand recursion, you must understand recursion."&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; In the English-language version of the [[Google]] web search engine, when a search for "recursion" is made, the site suggests "Did you mean: ''recursion''." An alternative form is the following, from [[Andrew Plotkin]]: ''"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [[Douglas Hofstadter]] than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is."''

[[Recursive acronym]]s can also be examples of recursive humor. [[PHP]], for example, stands for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor", [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator." and [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's not Unix".

===Recursively defined sets===
{{Main|Recursive definition}}

====Example: the natural numbers====
{{see also|Closure (mathematics)}}
The canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the [[natural numbers]]:

:0 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''n'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''n'' + 1 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:The set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.

====Example: The set of true reachable propositions====
Another interesting example is the set of all "true reachable" propositions in an [[axiomatic system]].

*If a proposition is an axiom, it is a true reachable proposition.
*If a proposition can be obtained from true reachable propositions by means of inference rules, it is a true reachable proposition.
*The set of true reachable propositions is the smallest set of propositions satisfying these conditions.

This set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===Finite subdivision rules===
{{Main|Finite subdivision rule}}
Finite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create [[fractal]]-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the [[Cantor set]] is a subdivision rule, as is [[barycentric subdivision]].

===Functional recursion===
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] may be partly defined in terms of itself.  A familiar example is the [[Fibonacci number]] sequence: ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' − 1) + ''F''(''n'' − 2).  For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case ''F''(0) = 0 and ''F''(1) = 1.

A famous recursive function is the [[Ackermann function]], which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.

===Proofs involving recursive definitions===
Applying the standard technique of [[proof by cases]] to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields [[structural induction]], a powerful generalization of [[mathematical induction]] widely used to derive proofs in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]].

===Recursive optimization===
[[Dynamic programming]] is an approach to [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the [[Bellman equation]], which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).

===The recursion theorem===
In [[set theory]], this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist.  Given a set ''X'', an element ''a'' of ''X'' and a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem states that there is a unique function &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
for any natural number ''n''.

====Proof of uniqueness====
Take two functions &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;G: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  such that:

:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(n + 1) = f(G(n))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is an element of ''X''.

It can be proved by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'':

:'''Base Case''': &lt;math&gt;F(0) = a = G(0)&lt;/math&gt; so the equality holds for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Inductive Step''': Suppose &lt;math&gt;F(k) = G(k)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(k+1) = f(F(k)) = f(G(k)) = G(k+1).&lt;/math&gt;
::Hence F(k) = G(k) implies F(k+1) = G(k+1).

By induction, &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In computer science==
{{Main|Recursion (computer science)}}
A common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a [[computer programming]] technique, this is called [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is [[dynamic programming]]. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.

A classic example of recursion is the definition of the [[factorial]] function, given here in [[C (programming language)|C]] code:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

If not having reached the [[base case (recursion)|base case]] and returning with value {{math|1,}} every [[Instance (computer science)|instantiation]] of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by {{math|1}} ({{code|(n - 1)}}), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of {{code|n}}, analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.

Recursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in [[parser]]s for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.

[[Recurrence relation]]s are equations to define one or more sequences  recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be "solved" to obtain a non-recursive definition.

Use of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is usually simplicity.  The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15772">'''Science capital''' is a conceptual tool for measuring an individual's exposure and knowledge of science. It can be used to help understanding how [[social class]] affects people's aspirations and involvement in science. The concept comes from research in education but is also used more broadly in practice and policy, for instance in the work of the [[Science and Technology Select Committee|Science and Technology Committee]] of the House of Commons in the UK.&lt;ref name = HoC&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmsctech/162/162.pdf|title=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee Science communication and engagement|last=House of Commons|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Science capital can be defined as the sum of all the science-related knowledge, attitudes, experiences and resources that an individual builds up  through their life. This includes what science they know about, what they think about science, the people they know who have an understanding of science, and the day-to-day engagement they have with science.&lt;ref name = HoC/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Science capital is made up of science related [[Cultural capital|cultural]] and [[social capital]] (institutionalized and/or embodied through knowledge, consumption, credentials, and social networks) as well as [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Louise|last2=Dawson|first2=Emily|last3=DeWitt|first3=Jen|last4=Seakins|first4=Amy|last5=Wong|first5=Billy|date=2015|title=Science capital": A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=52|pages=922–948|doi=10.1002/tea.21227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Louise|last2=DeWitt|first2=Jen|last3=Willis|first3=Beatrice|date=2013|title=Adolescent boys' science aspirations: Masculinity, capital, and power|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=51 |issue=1|pages=1–30|doi=10.1002/tea.21122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have suggested that science capital does not exist in isolation but has its value determined by someone's wider context and environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Louise|last2=Dawson|first2=Emily|last3=DeWitt|first3=Jen|last4=Seakins|first4=Amy|last5=Wong|first5=Billy|date=2015|title="Science capital": A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=52|pages=922–948|doi=10.1002/tea.21227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science capital has been framed around eight key dimensions,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecsite.eu/activities-and-services/news-and-publications/digital-spokes/issue-25#section=section-indepth&amp;href=/feature/depth/science-capital|title=Science capital|last=Seakins|first=Amy|last2=King|first2=Heather|date=2016|website=Spokes|publisher=Ecsite|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on statistical analysis of survey data from UK school students:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWitt|first=Jen|last2=Archer|first2=Louise|last3=Mau|first3=Ada|date=2016|title=Dimensions of science capital: exploring its potential for understanding students’ science participation|url=|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=38 |issue=16|pages=2431–2449|doi=10.1080/09500693.2016.1248520}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Scientific literacy]] 
# Science-related attitudes, values and dispositions
# Knowledge about the transferability of science (that science 'open doors' to many careers)
# Science media consumption
# Participation in out-of-school science learning contexts
# Family science skills, knowledge and qualifications
# Knowing people in science-related roles
# Talking about science in everyday life&amp;nbsp;
These eight dimensions collapse into four 'types' of science capital: what you know ([[scientific literacy]]); how you think (attitudes and dispositions); what you do (science-related activities and behaviours); and who you know (social contacts and networks). The first three 'types' include [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and [[cultural capital]] and the fourth, [[social capital]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research shows that measuring science capital provides a better prediction of science aspirations than a general measure of capital.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==History==

The concept of science capital draws on [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s work about capital and [[social reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd|year=1984|isbn=|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Nice|translator-first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reproduction in education, society and culture|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|last2=Passeron|first2=Jean-Claude|publisher=Sage|year=1990|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An invitation to reflexive sociology|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|last2=Wacquant|first2=Loic J. D.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science capital builds on, but is distinct from, how [[Pierre Bourdieu]] used the terms scientific, technical or technological capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science of science and reflexivity|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=University of Chicago Press and Polity Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The social structures of the economy|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Polity|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2539-3|location=Cambridge and Malden, MA.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Capital is not a new or separate form of capital. Instead, science capital is a way to think about grouping different kinds of science-related social and [[cultural capital]], particularly those that people could use or exchange to support their attainment, engagement and/or participation in science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Science capital was first developed by [https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=LARCH93 Louise Archer] and colleagues in the [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/aspires/index.aspx ASPIRES]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; project. Building on 5 years of research with youths aged 10–14 and their families, [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/aspires/index.aspx ASPIRES] found that children from families with more science related-resources (such as parents with scientific hobbies or careers) were more likely to want to pursue science at school and as a career. The concept of science capital was developed as a way to understand why these science-related resources, attitudes and aspirations led some children to pursue science, while others did not.

Science capital was developed conceptually and empirically through the [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/Research-Centres/cppr/Research/currentpro/Enterprising-Science/index.aspx Enterprising Science] project and the [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires/ ASPIRES 2] project. The [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/Research-Centres/cppr/Research/currentpro/Enterprising-Science/index.aspx Enterprising Science] project developed a survey to measure science capital and extended the concept of science capital beyond homes and into schools and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/exclusive-science-careers-favour-rich-male-asians-according-to-research-9799304.html|title=Science careers favour rich, male Asians, according to research|last=Garner|first=Richard|date=16 October 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=7 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science capital is being used to develop strategies for teaching in primary and secondary schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/Research-Centres/cppr/Research/currentpro/Enterprising-Science/Science-Capital-in-the-Classroom.aspx|title=Watch: Science Capital in the Classroom|last=King's College London|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to develop measures of science capital for adults.

==ASPIRES==
ASPIRES, currently based at UCL Institute of Education, is a 10-year longitudinal research project studying young people’s science and career aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASPIRES 2|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires|website=UCL|publisher=UCL|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ASPIRES study (2009-2013) tracked young people's science and career aspirations from age 10-14. ASPIRES 2  continues to track young people until age 19, to understand the changing influences of the family, school, careers education and social identities and inequalities on young people's science and career aspirations. Key findings include:

# Students with low Science Capital are unlikely to see science as ‘for me’. In the first phase of our project, we introduced the term Science Capital to refer to someone’s science-related qualifications, understanding, knowledge (about science and ‘how it works’), interest and social contacts (e.g. knowing someone who works in a science-related job).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9524">The '''Spoken English Corpus''' ('''SEC''') is a [[speech corpus]] used in [[corpus linguistics]] consisting of a collection of recordings of spoken [[British English]] compiled during the period 1984-7 through a collaboration, funded by [[International Business Machines|IBM]], between the Unit for Computer Research on the English Language (UCREL) at the [[University of Lancaster]] and the IBM Scientific Centre in [[Winchester]].&lt;ref name="leech" /&gt; The corpus comprises 53 recorded passages, mainly recorded from the [[BBC]], spoken in the accent usually referred to as [[Received Pronunciation]], or RP. It covers categories such as commentary. news broadcast, lecture and dialogue.&lt;ref name="Xiao1" /&gt; The corpus contains 52,637 words, in a recording time of 339 minutes. The compilation of the corpus is described by Lita Taylor in her 1996 article "The Compilation of the Spoken English Corpus."&lt;ref name="taylor" /&gt; The whole corpus in print can be purchased at Routledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/A-Corpus-of-Formal-British-English-Speech-The-Lancaster-IBM-Spoken-English/Knowles-Taylor-Williams/p/book/9780582056398|title=A Corpus of Formal British English Speech: The Lancaster/IBM Spoken English Corpus (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcription of the recordings ==

A system was devised for transcription of the [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of the material in the recordings, and two transcribers, Gerry Knowles and Briony Williams, analysed the entire corpus. The transcription system is explained by Williams,&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; and an experiment was conducted by Brian Pickering to assess the degree of [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between the two transcribers on a section of the Corpus containing around 1000 [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]-units which was transcribed by both transcribers.&lt;ref name="pickering" /&gt; Good agreement was found.

==Other analysis==

[[Part-of-speech tagging|Grammatical tagging]] of each word was added to the text of the SEC by an automatic process;&lt;ref name="taylor2" /&gt; the fact that this tagging was in machine-readable form made it possible to relate [[grammatical]] and [[prosodic]] information in the texts. Subsequent work used probabilistic models to develop further the grammatical tagging and to produce automatic [[parsing]] techniques.&lt;ref name=sampson /&gt;

== Machine-Readable Spoken English Corpus (MARSEC) ==

Although the text and its associated tagging existed in machine-readable form, the recordings themselves existed only as tape-recordings. A collaboration, funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] in 1992-4, between speech scientists at the Universities of Lancaster and [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] in the United Kingdom set out to produce a version of the corpus which contained the recordings in digital form, time-linked to the text.&lt;ref name="roachetal" /&gt; The principal researchers were Gerry Knowles and Tamas Varadi (Lancaster) and Peter Roach and Simon Arnfield (Leeds). The outline of the project is set out in Knowles,&lt;ref name="knowles" /&gt; and the automatic time-alignment is described by Roach and Arnfield.&lt;ref name="roach" /&gt; The digitized recordings were recorded on [[CD-ROM]]; it was subsequently made available for downloading for research purposes from Leeds University, though this facility is no longer supported.

== Aix-MARSEC ==

The work on MARSEC in Lancaster and Leeds finished around 1995, but the corpus has subsequently been the object of a considerable amount of further development at the [[University of Aix-en-Provence]], France, under the direction of Daniel Hirst.&lt;ref name="hirst" /&gt; The database consists of two major components: the digitalized recordings from MARSEC and the annotations. Annotations have so far been undertaken at nine levels, including [[phoneme]]s, [[syllable]]s, [[word]]s, [[stress feet]], [[Rhythm#Linguistics|rhythm]] units and minor and major [[Turn construction unit|turn units]].  Two supplementary levels, the grammatical annotation by CLAWS and a Property Grammar system developed at Aix-en-Provence, are to be integrated soon.&lt;ref name="auron" /&gt; A possible disadvantage of this treatment is that the corpus can only be searched using specially written scripts.&lt;ref name="wichmann"/&gt; The database, together with tools, is available under [[GNU GPL]] licensing at the Aix-MARSEC project site.&lt;ref name="hirst2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">'''"Sudbury Saturday Night"''' is one of the most famous songs by [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], which depicts the hard-drinking, hard-partying social life of [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock miners]] in the [[Northern Ontario]] mining city of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Gillian|title=The North American Folk Music Revival: Nation and Identity in the United States and Canada, 1945-1980|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007|page=158|isbn=978-0-7546-5756-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtVapc9Nt8kC&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song's chorus is:
: ''Yeah, the girls are out to [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]]
: ''And the boys are gettin' [[drunkenness|stinko]]
: ''And we'll think no more of [[CVRD Inco|Inco]]
: ''On a Sudbury Saturday night''

Originally released on Connors' 1967 debut album ''The Northlands' Own Tom Connors'', the song also reappeared on his 1972 album ''Bud the Spud'', his live album ''Live at the Horseshoe'', the compilations ''A Proud Canadian'' and ''25 of the Best Stompin' Tom Souvenirs'', and the 1995 rerelease of ''The Northlands' Own Tom Connors'' under the title ''Northlands Zone''.

"Sudbury Saturday Night" was covered by Canadian musician [[Kim Mitchell]] in 1998 on the compilation ''[[Summer Dock Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeBlanc|first=Larry|date=1998-07-11|title=New Discs Feature Vintage Pop|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|volume=110|issue=28|pages=48|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Sundaranand''' (born April, 1926 near Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India) is a [[Yogi]], [[photographer]], [[author]] and [[mountaineer]] who lectures widely in [[India]] on threats to the [[Ganges River]] and the loss of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[glacier]]s due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/430/india-journal5.html|title=Gangotri: The Clicking Swami|last=Brancaccio|first=David|author2=photographs by John Siceloff |date=2008-08-01|work=NOW|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hindi.webdunia.com/regional-hindi-news/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-110011900068_1.htm|date=18 July 2015|title=(Amjad Ali Khan Saraswati Award)|publisher=WebDunia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020113/spectrum/main1.htm|date=13 January 2002|title=Celestial Peaks, Divine Grandeur: The Himalayas through the lens of a sadhu|publisher=Sunday Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundarananda was a student of the reclusive [[yoga]] master Swami [[Tapovan Maharaj]] (1889–1957), who wrote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries about yogic life in the [[Himalayas]] in the classic yoga book ''Wanderings in the Himalayas'' (Himagiri Vihar).&lt;ref&gt;Wanderings in the Himalayas, English Edition, Published by Chinmaya Publication Trust, Madras-3, 1960, translated by T.N. Kesava Pillai, M.A.&lt;/ref&gt; Sundaranand lived with Swami Tapovan in the then inaccessible area of [[Gangotri]], at the source of the [[Ganges]], which is considered one of India's most sacred places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarujala.com/news/city/uttarkashi/Uttar-Kashi-70739-17/|title=आर्ट गैलरी-ध्यान केंद्र बनवाने में जुटे स्वामी सुंदरानंद- Amarujala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicasia.in/newsDetails.php?Id=17466 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100930/http://publicasia.in/newsDetails.php?Id=17466 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1948, he has lived by the Ganges in Gangotri, at 10,400 feet, in a modest hut (''kuti'') which his master Swami Tapovan Maharaj later bequeathed to him on his death in 1957.  There, Swami Sundaranand has lived in solitude and through the severest of winters without any comforts or conveniences.&lt;ref&gt;Elixir Magazine, Spring 2006, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; He has witnessed up close the gradual shrinking of the [[Gangotri Glacier]] from which the Ganges springs forth, and has chronicled his devotion to the natural beauty of the Indian Himalayas as an accomplished photographer. A museum devoted to environmental protection and spiritual guidance, containing Swami Sundaranand's Himalayan photography, is now in the planning stages. It will be located in Gangotri on the property of Sundaranand and his master.

As an ascetic, he took the brahmacharya sadhu vow over 59 years ago and daily devotes his life to rigorous meditation and other spiritual practices. He continues to be a principal advocate for the ecological preservation of the Himalayas, the Ganges and its source at Gangotri.

He has taken more than 100,000 photos, over a 50-year period, of the shrinking Gangotri glacier in the Indian Himalayas. He now travels India raising awareness of the Gangotri's rapid decline.&lt;ref name="OurPlanet"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/ourplanet/2007/may/en/op-2007-05-en-fullversion.pdf |title=Melting Ice: A Hot Topic, Climate Change and the Crysosphere |format=pdf |journal =Our Planet:The Magazine of the United Nations Environment Programme |date=May 2007| pages=4 |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed "the ''[[Sadhu]]'' Who Clicks" because of his photography, he is also a noted mountain climber, having scaled over 25 Himalayan peaks, and climbing twice with Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]].&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0103/p07s02-sten.htm |title=Himalaya's receding glaciers suffer neglect &amp;#124; csmonitor.com |author=Janaki Kremmer |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=3 January 2007  |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Edmund Hillary paid his respects to Swami Sundaranad in the 1980s at his [[Gangotri]] hut.&lt;ref&gt;Personal Time with Swami-ji, 157 mins Film, The Center for Healing Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Gangotri glacier, Swami Sundaranand says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1949, when I first saw the glacier, I felt as if all my sins were washed away and I had truly attained rebirth. But now, it is impossible to experience that Ganga of the past.&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Swami Sundaranand is the author of the book ''Himalaya: Through the Lens of a Sadhu'' with over 425 photographs spanning 60 years of his work.&lt;ref name="urlhimalaya-sundaranand"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.meaus.com/himalaya-sundaranand.htm |title=Book Review: HIMALAYA: THROUGH THE LENS OF A SADHU|author = B.

A lookout point and plaque have been built downriver from Gangotri and dedicated to the Swami's work and efforts.

Swami Sundaranand is the subject of a feature documentary shot at his home in Gangotri titled ''Personal Time with Swamiji''. The film was produced by [http://www.thecenterforhealingarts.com The Center for Healing Arts] and directed by [[Victor Demko]].

==Views on global warming==
Over the past six decades, Swami Sundaranand has used his combined interests to raise awareness about the Ganga. "When I first came to this region, it was one of the most beautiful part of the Himalayas," he says. "It is difficult to imagine the purity of the Ganga and the abundance of Himalayan vegetation and fauna that was prevalent then. We don't know what we have cruelly destroyed."

Swami Sundaranand has lived in Gangotri since 1948, when he became a renunciate, and arrived there from Andhra Pradesh. In his words: "A lot has changed since then. Although the air is cold here, the sun is harsh. It's becoming hotter every year. People say it is global warming. I say it is a global warning."

The pollution of Ganga in the plains has been an oft-repeated refrain, but, according to Sundaranand, a graver threat is its pollution at the source. He attributes this to the unchecked construction of hotels and ''ashrams'' in Gangotri and the dumping of waste from these locations, such as faecal matter and garbage, into the Ganga. According to him, "there are no environment lovers left here, only money lovers". Every year, while the temple town closes during the harsh winter months, unchecked construction and felling of trees is at its peak. According to the sadhu, "many bhoj trees in Bhojbasa, en route [[Gaumukh]] have been cut down. Earlier, on my treks to the Gaumukh glacier, I could spot rare animals like the snow leopard and musk deer. They are rarely visible now".

The sadhu is also an avid mountaineer — it was during his treks to the glacier over the last 10–15 years that he saw the glacier retreat more rapidly than ever before. According to him, Gaumukh was barely 1&amp;nbsp;km away from Bhojbasa, but today, it is 4&amp;nbsp;km away and that every year, the glacier was retreating by at least 10 metres. He has expreseed the view that the pollution of Ganga at its source and melting Himalayan glaciers were the real issues that environmentalists needed to urgently take up, rather than opposing the construction of dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/The-sadhu-who-clicks/articleshow/8730692.cms|first=Atul |last=Sethi |publisher=Times of India|title=The sadhu who clicks|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Swami Sundaranand has a strong connection with the [[Himalayas]] that few others have. He has climbed dozens of its peaks, several of them over 21,000 feet above sea level, and has lectured at Tensing's Himalayan Institute (a famous mountaineering school). He is also a skilled [[naturalist]] that is familiar with thousands of Himalayan plants and he knows the lore and medicinal uses of these species.

He engages in 3 hours of meditation during the day, and may meditate at night into the early hours of the morning. The most important parts of his life are meditation, ''japa'' and ''pranayama''. As a younger man he was an accomplished ''hatha'' yogi, mastering 300 postures, and he continues to practice it daily. He is very devoted to the ecosystem in which he has lived for forty years and believes that "God does not reside in temples or mosques - he is scattered everywhere in the courtyard of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=665|publisher=Hinduism Today|title=Swami Sundarananda, John Muir of the Himalayas|date=October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=river /&gt;

'''Technology education''' is the study of [[technology]], in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association|ITEA]]. (2000). Standards for technological literacy; Content for the study of technology. Executive Summary. Reston, Va, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and [[tools]] with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education Today: International Perspectives|last=de Vries|first=Marc|last2=Fletcher|first2=Stefan|last3=Labudde|first3=Peter|last4=Lang|first4=Martin|last5=Mammes|first5=Ingelore|last6=Max|first6=Charles|last7=Munk|first7=Dieter|last8=Nicholl|first8=Bill|last9=Strobel|first9=Johannes|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830933847|location=Munster|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall [[Scientific literacy|scientific]] and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education in School and Industry: Emerging Didactics for Human Resource Development|last=Blandow|first=Dietrich|last2=Dyrenfurth|first2=Michael|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=3540582509|location=Berlin|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology education should not be confused with [[educational technology]]. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugger Jr.|first=William E.|last2=Naik|first2=Nitin|date=September 2001|title=Clarifying Misconceptions between Technology Education and Educational Technology|url=https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=49264|journal=Technology Teacher|volume=61|issue=1|pages=31–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Technology education is an offshoot of the [[Industrial arts|Industrial Arts]] tradition in the [[United States]] and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "[[industrial arts education]]" was changed to be "technology education" in [[New York (state)|New York State]]; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/|title=History {{!}} Department of Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oswego.edu|at=sec. Technology Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education for Teachers|last=Williams|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Anthony|publisher=Macmillan Education Australia Pty Ltd|year=1996|isbn=0732940907|location=South Melbourne|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[Mars suit]] design was utilized as a topic for technology education.&lt;ref name="nasa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Designing_Spacesuits_Mars.html|title=Designing Spacesuits for Mars|website=NASA|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical education is entirely different from general education

TeachThought, a private entity, described technology education as being in the “status of childhood and bold experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teachthought.com/technology/the-current-state-of-technology-in-the-classroom-infographic/|title=The Current State Of Technology In The Classroom [Infographic] -|date=2013-03-20|work=TeachThought|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;” A survey of teachers across the United States by an independent market research company found out that 86 percent of teacher-respondents agree that technology must be used in the classroom. 96 percent say it promotes engagement of students and 89% agree technology improves student outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fractuslearning.com/edtech-stats/|title=18 EdTech Stats About the Current State of Technology in Education|date=2013-08-26|work=Fractus Learning|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology is present in many education systems.

In [[statistics]], a '''unit of observation''' is the unit described by the [[data]] that one analyzes. For example, in a study of the [[demand for money]], the unit of observation might be chosen as the individual, with different observations ('''data point'''s) for a given point in time differing as to which individual they refer to; or the unit of observation might be the country, with different observations differing only in regard to the country they refer to. A study may have a differing unit of observation and [[unit of analysis]]: for example, in [[community]] research, the [[research design]] may collect data at the individual level of observation but the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] might be at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals. Together, the unit of observation and the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] define the [[Sample population|population]] of a research enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blalock |first=Hubert M., Jr. |year=1972 |title=Social Statistics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |isbn=0-07-005751-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data point==
A '''data point''' or '''observation''' is a set of one or more [[Level of measurement|measurement]]s on a single member of unit of observation. For example, in a study of the determinants of [[money demand]] with the [[unit of observation]] being the individual, a data point might be the values of income, wealth, age of individual, and number of dependents. [[Statistical inference]] about the population would be conducted using a [[statistical sample]] consisting of various such data points.

In addition, in [[statistical graphics]], a "data point" may be an individual item with a statistical display; such points may relate to either a single member of a population or to a [[summary statistic]] calculated for a given subpopulation.

==Types of data==
The measurements contained a unit of observation are formally ''typed'', where here ''type'' is used in a way compatible with [[datatype]] in [[computing]]; so that the type of measurement can specify whether the measurement results in a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value from {yes, no}, an [[integer]] or [[real number]], the identity of some [[Category (mathematics)|category]], or some [[vector space|vector]] or [[Array data structure|array]]. 

The implication of ''point'' is often that the data may be plotted in a graphic display, but in many cases the data are [[data processing|processed numerically]] before that is done. In the context of [[statistical graphics]], measured values for individuals or summary statistics for different subpopulations are displayed as separate symbols within a display; since such symbols can differ by shape, size and colour, a single ''data point'' within a display can convey multiple aspects of the set of measurements for an individual or subpopulation.

All measures that are taken to ensure a long life of wood fall under the definition '''wood preservation''' (timber treatment).
[[File:PiquetPesticides detail 02.jpg|thumb|In moist and oxygenated soil, there are few treatments that enable vulnerable wood (softwood here) to resist for long against bacterial or fungal degradation]]
[[File:PiquetPesticides detail 01.JPG|thumb|Detail of sample in photo above]]

Apart from structural wood preservation measures, there are a number of different ([[chemical]]) [[preservative]]s and processes (also known as '''timber treatment''', '''lumber treatment''' or '''pressure treatment''') that can extend the life of [[wood]], [[timber]], wood structures or [[engineered wood]]. These generally increase the [[:wikt:durability|durability]] and resistance from being destroyed by [[insect]]s or [[fungus]].

==History==
[[File:Teredolites.jpg|thumb|A modern wharf piling bored by bivalves known as ''[[shipworm]]s''.]]
As proposed by Richardson,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, B.A. Wood preservation. Landcaster: The Construction, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; treatment of wood has been practiced for almost as long as the use of [[wood]] itself. There are records of wood preservation reaching back to ancient [[Greece]] during [[Alexander the Great]]'s rule, where bridge wood was soaked in [[olive oil]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] protected their ship hulls by brushing the wood with tar. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] wood preservation became a cornerstone of the wood processing industry. Inventors and scientists such as Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan made historic developments in wood preservation, with the preservative solutions and processes. Commercial pressure treatment began in the latter half of the 19th century with the protection of railroad cross-ties using [[creosote]]. Treated wood was used primarily for industrial, agricultural, and utility applications, where it is still used, until its use grew considerably (at least in the United States) in the 1970s as homeowners began building decks and backyard projects. Innovation in treated timber products continues to this day, with consumers becoming more interested in less toxic materials.

==Hazards==
Wood that has been industrially pressure-treated with approved preservative products poses a limited risk to the public, and should be disposed of properly. On December 31, 2003, the U.S. wood treatment industry stopped treating residential lumber with [[arsenic]] and chromium ([[chromated copper arsenate]], or CCA). This was a voluntary agreement with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. CCA was replaced by copper-based pesticides, with exceptions for certain industrial uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/reregistration/cca/sealant_qa.htm |title=Questions &amp; Answers on CCA-Treated Wood Sealant Studies (Interim Results) &amp;#124; Pesticides &amp;#124; EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCA may still be used for outdoor products like utility trailer beds and non-residential construction like piers, docks, and agricultural buildings. Industrial wood preservation chemicals are generally not available directly to the public and may require special approval to import or purchase depending on the product and the jurisdiction where being used. In most countries, industrial wood preservation operations are notifiable industrial activities that require licensing from relevant regulatory authorities such as EPA or equivalent. Reporting and licensing conditions vary widely depending on the particular chemicals used and the country of use.

Although pesticides are used to treat lumber, preserving lumber protects natural resources (in the short term) by enabling wood products to last longer. Previous poor practices in industry have left legacies of contaminated ground and water around wood treatment sites in some cases. However, under currently approved industry practices and regulatory controls such as implemented in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and elsewhere, environmental impact of these operations should be minimal.{{POV statement|date=March 2014}}{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Wood treated with modern preservatives is generally safe to handle given appropriate handling precautions and personal protection measures. However, treated wood may present certain hazards in some circumstances such as during combustion or where loose wood dust particles or other fine toxic residues are generated or where treated wood comes into direct contact with food and agriculture.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Preservatives containing copper in the form of microscopic particles have recently been introduced to the market, usually with "micronized" or "micro" trade names and designations such as MCQ or MCA. The manufacturers represent that these products are safe and EPA has registered these products.

The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) recommends that all treated wood be accompanied by a Consumer Information Sheet (CIS), to communicate safe handling and disposal instructions as well as potential health and environmental hazards of treated wood. Many producers have opted to provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) instead. Although the practice of distributing MSDS instead of CIS is widespread there is an ongoing debate regarding the practice and how best to best communicate potential hazards and hazard mitigation to the end-user. Neither MSDS or the newly adopted International Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are required for treated lumber under current U.S. Federal law.

====American Wood Protection Association====
[http://www.woodnaturally.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Select-the-Right-Preserved-Wood-for-Your-Project-500x387.jpg]

Founded in 1904, the American Wood Protection Association (AWPA), formerly American Wood-Preservers' Association, is a non-profit organization which is the standard setting body for wood preservation standards (including ANSI). AWPA Standards are developed by its technical committees in an open, consensus-based process that involves individuals from all facets of wood preservation: Producers of preservatives and preservative components; producers of treated and untreated wood products; end users of treated wood; engineers, architects and building code officials; government entities, academia, and other groups with a general interest in wood preservation. AWPA's Standards are universally specified for wood preservation in the US, and are recognized worldwide.

AWPA standards help ensure that treated wood products perform satisfactorily for their intended use. They are recognized and used by most, if not all, specifiers of treated wood including electrical utility, marine, road and building construction as well as by local, state and federal governments. "AWPA", "American Wood Protection Association", identifiers of AWPA Standards (e.g., U1, T1, M4, etc.), and Use Category designations (e.g., UC1, UC3B, UC4A, etc.) are AWPA trademarks and the intellectual property of AWPA and its Technical Committees.

Wood preservative systems produced under the AWPA standards system for the residential market are required to be inspected under the stringent American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC) third party inspection system in order to assure compliance with AWPA standards.

While many wood preservative systems are produced under the AWPA standards system, there are wood preservative products in the market that have not earned AWPA standard status and are not subject to the ALSC inspection system. Compliance with AWPA and ASLC will be noted by the AWPA logo on the product end tags.

===Marketing of wood preservatives===
In general, marketers of wood preservation systems favor certain terminology. For example, the term '[[preservative]]' is used in preference to words such as: [[chemical]], [[pesticide]], [[fungicide]] or [[biocide]]. And with newer preservatives, the term '[[micronized]]' is favored over the term nanoparticle or nanotechnology, which may raise public safety concerns.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Chemical preservatives==
Chemical preservatives can be classified into three broad categories: water-borne preservatives, oil-borne preservatives, and light [[organic solvent]] preservatives (LOSPs). These are discussed in more detail below.

===Micronized copper technology===
Particulate ([[micronised]] or dispersed) [[copper]] preservative technology has recently been introduced in the US and Europe. In these systems, the copper is ground to micro sized particles and suspended in water rather than being dissolved in a chemical reaction as is the case with other copper products such as ACQ and Copper Azole. There are currently two particulate copper systems in production. One system uses a quat biocide system (known as MCQ) and is a take-off of ACQ. The other uses an azole biocide (known as MCA or μCA-C) and is a take-off of Copper Azole.

Proponents of the particulate copper systems make the case that the particulate copper system perform as well or better than the dissolved copper systems as a wood preservative, but other industry researchers disagree. None of the particulate copper systems have been submitted to the [[American Wood Protection Association]] (AWPA) for evaluation, thus the particulate systems should not be used in applications where AWPA standards are required. However, all of the particulate copper systems have been tested and approved for building code requirements by the [[International Code Council]] (ICC). The particulate copper systems provide a lighter color than dissolved copper systems such as ACQ or copper azole.

Proponents of the micronized copper systems claim that the systems are subject to third party inspection under a quality monitor program. However, the monitoring program is not subject to oversight by the American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC) as is required for the AWPA standard systems.

Two particulate copper systems, one marketed as MicroPro and the other as Wolmanized using μCA-C formulation, have achieved Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scsglobalservices.com/environmentally-preferable-product|title=Environmentally Preferable Product - SCS Global Services|author=|date=|website=www.scsglobalservices.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/sustainability/buy-green-products-services-and-vehicles/buy-green-products/environmentally-preferred-products|title=Environmentally Preferred Products|author=|date=|website=www.gsa.gov|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''EPP'' certification was issued by Scientific Certifications Systems (SCS), and is based on a comparative life-cycle impact assessments with an industry standard.

The copper particle size used in the "micronized" copper beads ranges from 1 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm with an average under 300&amp;nbsp;nm. Larger particles (such as actual micron-scale particles) of copper do not adequately penetrate the wood cell walls. These micronized preservatives use nano particles of copper oxide or copper carbonate, for which there are alleged safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.acs.org/action/showLogin?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fpubs.acs.org%2Fisubscribe%2Fjournals%2Fcen%2F86%2Fi35%2Fhtml%2F8635scic.html&amp;6 |format=PDF |title=C&amp;EN |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An environmental group has recently petitioned EPA to revoke the registration of the micronized copper products citing safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotech.lawbc.com/uploads/file/00068945.PDF ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713191550/http://nanotech.lawbc.com/uploads/file/00068945.PDF |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alkaline copper quaternary====
[[Alkaline copper quaternary]] (ACQ) is a preservative made of copper, a [[fungicide]], and a [[quaternary ammonium]] compound (quat) like [[Didecyldimethylammonium chloride|didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride]], an [[insecticide]] which also augments the fungicidal treatment. ACQ has come into wide use in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on [[#Chromated copper arsenate (CCA)|CCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrp/fpl_rp618.pdf |format=PDF |title=Alternatives to Chromated Copper Arsenate for Residential Construction |publisher=Fpl.fs.fed.us |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use is governed by national and international standards, which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use.

Since it contains high levels of copper, ACQ-treated timber is five times more corrosive to common [[steel]]. It is necessary to use [[fastener]]s meeting or exceeding requirements for ASTM A 153 Class D, such as ceramic-coated, as mere [[galvanized]] and even common grades of [[stainless steel]] corrode. The U.S. began mandating the use of non-arsenic containing wood preservatives for virtually all residential use timber in 2004.

The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards for ACQ require a retention of 0.15&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (PCF) for above ground use and 0.40&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for ground contact.

Chemical Specialties, Inc (CSI, now Viance) received [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award]] in 2002 for commercial introduction of ACQ. Its widespread use has eliminated major quantities of arsenic and chromium previously contained in CCA.

====Copper azole====
Copper [[azole]] preservative (denoted as CA-B and CA-C under American Wood Protection Association/AWPA standards) is a major copper based wood preservative that has come into wide use in Canada, the US, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on CCA. Its use is governed by national and international standards, which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use.

Copper azole is similar to ACQ with the difference being that the dissolved copper preservative is augmented by an azole co-[[biocide]] like organic [[triazole]]s such as [[tebuconazole]] or [[propiconazole]], which are also used to protect food crops, instead of the quat biocide used in ACQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alternatives to Chromated Copper Arsenate for Residential Construction |last=Lebow |first=Stan |date=April 2004 |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrp/fpl_rp618.pdf}} Report Research Paper FPL−RP−618.&lt;/ref&gt; The azole co-biocide yields a copper azole product that is effective at lower retentions than required for equivalent ACQ performance. The general appearance of wood treated with copper azole preservative is similar to CCA with a green colouration.

Copper azole treated wood is marketed widely under the ''Preserve CA'' and ''Wolmanized'' brands in North America, and the ''Tanalith'' brand across Europe and other international markets.

The AWPA standard retention for CA-B is 0.10&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for above ground applications and 0.21&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for ground contact applications. Type C copper azole, denoted as CA-C, has been introduced under the Wolmanized and Preserve brands. The AWPA standard retention for CA-C is 0.06&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for above ground applications and 0.15&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for ground contact applications.

===Copper naphthenate===
[[Copper naphthenate]], invented in Denmark in 1911, has been used effectively for many applications including: fence posts, canvas, nets, greenhouses, utility poles, railroad ties, beehives, and wooden structures in ground contact. Copper naphthenate is registered with the EPA as a non-restricted use pesticide, so there is no federal applicators licensing requirements for its use as a wood preservative. Copper Naphthenate can be applied by brush, dip, or pressure treatment.

The University of Hawaii has found that copper naphthenate in wood at loadings of 1.5 lbs per cubic foot is resistant to Formosan termite attack. On February 19, 1981 the Federal Register outlined the EPA's position regarding the health risks associated with various wood preservatives. As a result, the National Park Service recommended the use of copper naphthenate in its facilities as an approved substitute for [[pentachlorophenol]], [[creosote]], and inorganic [[arsenical]]s. A 50-year study presented to AWPA in 2005 by Mike Freeman and Douglas Crawford says, "This study reassessed the condition of the treated wood posts in southern Mississippi, and statistically calculated the new expected post life span. It was determined that commercial wood preservatives, like pentachlorophenol in oil, creosote, and copper naphthenate in oil, provided excellent protection for posts, with life spans now calculated to exceed 60 years. Surprisingly, creosote and penta treated posts at 75% of the recommended AWPA retention, and copper naphthenate at 50% of the required AWPA retention, gave excellent performance in this AWPA Hazard Zone 5 site. Untreated southern pine posts lasted 2 years in this test site." &lt;ref&gt;http://coppercare.azurewebsites.net/Documents/CuNapDocs/AWPA%2050%20Year%20Wood%20Preservative%20Post%20Study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWPA M4 Standard for the care of preservative-treated wood products, reads, "The appropriateness of the preservation system for field treatment shall be determined by the type of preservative originally used to protect the product and the availability of a field treatment preservative. Because many preservative products are not packaged and labeled for use by the general public, a system different from the original treatment may need to be utilized for field treatment. Users shall carefully read and follow the instructions and precautions listed on the product label when using these materials. Copper naphthenate preservatives containing a minimum of 2.0% copper metal are recommended for material originally treated with copper naphthenate, pentachlorophenol, creosote, creosote solution or waterborne preservatives." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awpa.com/shop/index.asp|title=AWPA Store|author=|date=|website=www.awpa.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M4 Standard has been adopted by the&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iccsafe.org|title=ICC - International Code Council|author=|date=|website=iccsafe.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Code Council's (ICC) 2015 International Building Code (IBC) section 2303.1.9 Preservative-treated Wood, and 2015 International Residential Code (IRC) R317.1.1 Field Treatment. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials AASHTO has also adopted the AWPA M4 Standard.

A waterborne copper naphthenate is sold to consumers under the tradename QNAP 5W. Oilborne copper napthenates with 1% copper as metal solutions are sold to consumers under the tradenames Copper Green, and Wolmanized Copper Coat, a 2% copper as metal solution is sold under the tradename Tenino.

===Chromated copper arsenate (CCA)===
{{Main|Chromated copper arsenate}}
In CCA treatment, [[copper]] is the primary [[fungicide]], [[arsenic]] is a secondary fungicide and an [[insecticide]], and [[chromium]] is a fixative which also provides [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light resistance. Recognized for the greenish tint it imparts to timber, CCA is a preservative that was extremely common for many decades.

In the [[#Application processes|pressure treatment process]], an aqueous solution of CCA is applied using a vacuum and pressure cycle, and the treated wood is then stacked to dry. During the process, the mixture of oxides reacts to form insoluble compounds, helping with leaching problems.

The process can apply varying amounts of preservative at varying levels of pressure to protect the wood against increasing levels of attack. Increasing protection can be applied (in increasing order of attack and treatment) for: exposure to the atmosphere, implantation within soil, or insertion into a marine environment.

In the last decade concerns were raised that the chemicals may leach from the wood into surrounding [[soil]], resulting in concentrations higher than naturally occurring background levels. A study cited in ''[[Forest Products Journal]]'' found 12–13% of the chromated copper arsenate leached from treated wood buried in [[compost]] during a 12-month period. Once these chemicals have leached from the wood, they are likely to bind to soil particles, especially in soils with [[clay]] or soils that are more [[alkali]]ne than neutral. In the [[United States]] the US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report in 2002 stating that exposure to arsenic from direct human contact with CCA treated wood may be higher than was previously thought. On 1 January 2004, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in a voluntary agreement with industry began restricting the use of CCA in treated timber in residential and commercial construction, with the exception of shakes and [[Roof shingle|shingle]]s, permanent wood [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]], and certain commercial applications. This was in an effort to reduce the use of arsenic and improve environmental safety, although the EPA were careful to point out that they had not concluded that CCA treated wood structures in service posed an unacceptable risk to the community. The EPA did not call for the removal or dismantling of existing CCA treated wood structures.

In Australia, the [[Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority]] (APVMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apvma.gov.au/ |title=Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority |publisher=Apvma.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) restricted the use of CCA preservative for treatment of timber used in certain applications from March 2006. CCA may no longer be used to treat wood used in 'intimate human contact' applications such as children's play equipment, furniture, residential decking and handrailing. Use for low contact residential, commercial and industrial applications remains unrestricted, as does its use in all other situations. The APVMA decision to restrict the use of CCA in Australia was a precautionary measure, even though the report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apvma.gov.au/chemrev/arsenic.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917215227/http://www.apvma.gov.au/chemrev/arsenic.shtml |date=September 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found no evidence that demonstrated CCA treated timber posed unreasonable risks to humans in normal use. Similarly to the US EPA, the APVMA did not recommend dismantling or removal of existing CCA treated wood structures.

In Europe, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:004:0009:0011:EN:PDF Directive 2003/2/EC] restricts the marketing and use of arsenic, including CCA wood treatment. CCA treated wood is not permitted to be used in residential or domestic constructions. It is permitted for use in various industrial and public works, such as bridges, highway safety fencing, electric power transmission and telecommunications poles.
In the United Kingdom waste timber treated with CCA was classified in July 2012 as hazardous waste by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood waste: A short review of recent research|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/82571/consult-wood-waste-researchreview-20120731.pdf|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other copper compounds===
These include copper HDO (Bis-(N-cyclohexyldiazeniumdioxy)-copper or CuHDO), [[copper chromate]], [[copper citrate]], acid copper chromate, and ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA). The CuHDO treatment is an alternative to CCA, ACQ and CA used in Europe and in approval stages for United States and Canada. ACZA is generally used for marine applications.

===Borate preservatives===
[[Boric acid]], oxides and salts ([[borate]]s) are effective wood preservatives and are supplied under numerous brand names throughout the world. One of the most common compounds used is [[disodium octaborate tetrahydrate]] (commonly abbreviated DOT). Borate treated wood is of low toxicity to humans, and does not contain copper or other heavy metals. However, unlike most other preservatives, [[borate]] compounds do not become fixed in the wood and can be partially leached out if exposed repeatedly to water that flows away rather than evaporating (evaporation leaves the borate behind so is not a problem). Even though leaching will not normally reduce boron concentrations below effective levels for preventing fungal growth, borates should not be used where they will be exposed to repeated rain, water or ground contact unless the exposed surfaces are treated to repel water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/33518/1/Saadat_Md%20Nazmus_201211_Masters_thesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=Factors affecting distribution of borate to protect building envelope components from biodegradation |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zinc-borate compounds are less suspectible to leaching than sodium-borate compounds, but are still not recommended for below-ground use unless the timber is first sealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/8144.pdf |format=PDF |title=Selecting Lumber and Lumber Substitutes for Outdoor Exposures |publisher=Anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent interest in low toxicity timber for residential use, along with new regulations restricting some wood preservation agents, has resulted in a resurgence of the use of borate treated wood for floor beams and internal structural members. Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have developed organoborates which are much more resistant to leaching, while still providing timber with good protection from termite and fungal attack.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Carr, P. J. Duggan, D. G. Humphrey, J. A. Platts, E. M. Tyndall, "Quaternary Ammonium Arylspiroborate Esters as Organo-Soluble, Environmentally Benign Wood Protectants", Aust. J. Chem., 2005, 58, 901-911. J. M. Carr, P. J. Duggan, D. G. Humphrey, J. A. Platts, E. M. Tyndall, "Wood Protection Properties of Quaternary Ammonium Arylspiroborate Esters Derived from Naphthalene 2,3-diol, 2,2'-Biphenol and 3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid", Aust. J. Chem., 2010, 63, 1423–1429. http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/CH10132.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the production of these modified borates will limit their widespread take-up but they are likely to be suitable for certain niche applications, especially where low mammalian toxicity is of paramount importance.

===PTI wood preservatives===
Recent concerns about the health and environmental impacts of metallic wood preservatives have created a market interest in non-metallic wood preservatives such as [[Propiconazole]]-[[Tebuconazole]]-[[Imidacloprid]] better known as PTI. The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards for PTI require a retention of 0.018&amp;nbsp;lb/ft3 (PCF) for above ground use and 0.013&amp;nbsp;lb/ft3 when applied in combination with a wax stabilizer. The AWPA has not developed a standard for a PTI ground contact preservative, so PTI is currently limited to above ground applications such as decks. All three of the PTI components are also used in food crop applications. The very low required retentions for PTI pressure treated wood further limits impacts plus substantinally decreases the freight costs and associated [[environmental impact]]s for shipping preservative components to the pressure treating plants.

The PTI preservative imparts very little color to the wood. Producers generally add a color agent or a trace amount of copper solution so as to identify the wood as pressure treated and to better match the color of other pressure treated wood products. The PTI wood products are very well adapted for paint and stain applications with no bleed-through. The addition of the wax stabilizer allows a lower preservative retention plus substantially reduces the tendency of wood to warp and split as it dries. In combination with normal deck maintenance and sealer applications, the stabilizer helps maintain appearance and performance over time. PTI pressure treated wood products are no more corrosive than untreated wood and are approved for all types of metal contact, including aluminum.

PTI pressure treated wood products are relatively new to the market place and are not yet widely available in building supply stores. However, there are some suppliers selling PTI products for delivery anywhere in the US on a job lot order basis.

===Sodium silicate-based preservatives===
[[Sodium silicate]] is produced by fusing [[sodium carbonate]] with sand or heating both ingredients under pressure. It has been in use since the 19th century. It can be a deterrent against insect attack and possesses minor [[Fireproofing|flame-resistant]] properties; however, it is easily washed out of wood by moisture, forming a flake-like layer on top of the wood.

Timber Treatment Technology, [[limited liability company|LLC]], markets TimberSIL®, a sodium silicate wood preservative. The TimberSIL® proprietary process surrounds the wood fibers with a protective, non-toxic, amorphous [[glass]] matrix. The result is a product the company calls "Glass Wood," which they claim is Class A [[fire-retardant]], chemically inert, rot and decay resistant, and superior in strength to untreated wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timbersilwood.com/ |title=Timber Treatment Technologies &amp;#124; Timbersil |publisher=Timbersilwood.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timbersil is currently involved in litigation over its claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://audetlaw.com/investigations/timbersil-lawsuit/ TimberSIL Lawsuit Investigation Based on Premature Rotting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classactionsreporter.com/consumer/timber-treatment-technologies-wood-product-timbersil-alleged-defective-investigation Timber Treatment Technologies Wood Product TimberSIL Alleged Defective in Investigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potassium silicate-based preservatives===
There are a number of European natural paint fabricants that have developed [[potassium silicate]] (potassium waterglass) based preservatives. They frequently include boron compounds, cellulose, lignin and other plant extracts. They are a surface application with a minimal impregnation for internal use.

===Bifenthrin spray preservatives===
In Australia, a water-based [[bifenthrin]] preservative has been developed to improve the insect resistance of timber. As this preservative is applied by spray, it only penetrates the outer 2&amp;nbsp;mm of the timber cross-section. Concerns have been raised as to whether this thin-envelope system will provide protection against insects in the longer term, particularly when exposed to sunlight for extended periods.

===Fire retardant treated===
This treated wood utilizes a [[fire retardant]] chemical that remains stable in high temperature environments. The fire retardant is applied under pressure at a wood treating plant like the preservatives described above, or applied as a surface coating.

In both cases, treatment provides a physical barrier to flame spread. The treated wood chars but does not oxidize. Effectively this creates a convective layer that transfers flame heat to the wood in a uniform way which significantly slows the progress of fire to the material. There are several commercially available wood-based construction materials using pressure-treatment (such as those marketed in the United States and elsewhere under the trade names of "FirePro", "Burnblock" 'Woodsafe, Dricon', 'D-Blaze,' and 'Pyro-Guard'), as well as factory-applied coatings under the trade names of 'PinkWood' and 'NexGen'. Some site-applied coatings as well as brominated fire retardants have lost favor due to safety concerns as well as concerns surrounding the consistency of application. Specialized treatments also exist for wood used in weather-exposed applications.

The only impregnation-applied fire retardant commercially available in Australia is 'NexGen'. 'Guardian', which used calcium formate as a 'powerful wood modifying agent', was removed from sale in early 2010 for unspecified reasons.

===Oil-borne preservatives===
These include [[pentachlorophenol]] ("penta") and [[creosote]]. They emit a strong petrochemical odor and are generally not used in consumer products. Both of these pressure treatments routinely protect wood for 40 years in most applications.

====Coal-tar creosote====
Creosote was the first wood preservative to gain industrial importance more than 150 years ago and it is still widely used today for protection of industrial timber components where long service life is essential.
[[Creosote]] is a [[tar]]-based preservative that is commonly used for [[utility pole]]s and [[railroad tie]]s (UK: railway sleepers). Creosote is one of the oldest wood preservatives, and was originally derived from a [[destructive distillation|wood distillate]], but now, virtually all creosote is manufactured from the distillation of [[coal tar]]. Creosote is regulated as a [[pesticide]], and is not usually sold to the general public.

====Linseed oil====
In recent years in Australia and New Zealand, [[linseed oil]] has been incorporated in preservative formulations as a solvent and water repellent to "envelope treat" timber. This involves just treating the outer 5&amp;nbsp;mm of the cross-section of a timber member with preservative (e.g., permethrin 25:75), leaving the core untreated. While not as effective as CCA or LOSP methods, envelope treatments are significantly cheaper, as they use far less preservative. Major preservative manufacturers add a blue (or red) dye to envelope treatments. Blue colored timber is for use south of the Tropic of Capricorn and red for elsewhere. The colored dye also indicates that the timber is treated for resistance to termites/white ants. There is an ongoing promotional campaign in Australia for this type of treatment.

===Other emulsions===

====Light organic solvent preservatives (LOSP)====
This class of timber treatments use [[white spirit]], or light oils such as [[kerosene]], as the solvent carrier to deliver preservative compounds into timber. Synthetic pyrethroids are typically used as an insecticide, such as permethrin, bifenthrin or deltamethrin. In Australia and New Zealand, the most common formulations use Permethrin as an insecticide, and Propaconazole and Tebuconazole as fungicides. While still using a chemical preservative, this formulation contains no heavy-metal compounds.

With the introduction of strict volatile organic compound (VOC) laws in the European Union, LOSPs have disadvantages due to the high cost and long process times associated with vapour-recovery systems. LOSPs have been emulsified into water-based solvents. While this does significantly reduce VOC emissions, the timber swells during treatment, removing many of the advantages of LOSP formulations.

===Epoxy===
Various Epoxy resins usually thinned with a solvent like [[acetone]] or [[Methyl ethyl ketone|MEK]] can be used to both preserve and seal wood.

===New technologies===

==== Biological modified timber ====
[[File:Paviljoen Eindhoven NobelWood.jpg|thumb|Paviljoen Eindhoven NobelWood]]
Biological modified timber is treated with biopolymers from agricultural waste. After drying and curing, the soft timber becomes durable and strong. With this process fast growing pinewood reaches similar properties  of tropical hardwood. Production facilities for this process are in The Netherlands and is known under the trade name “NobelWood”.

From agricultural waste, like sugarcane bagasse, [[furfuryl alcohol]] is manufactured. Theoretically this alcohol can be from any bio-mass waste fermented and therefore can be called a green chemical.  After condensation reactions pre-polymers are formed  from furfuryl alcohol. 
Fast growing softwood is impregnated with the water-soluble bio-polymer. After impregnation the wood is dried and heated up which initiates a polymerisation reaction between the bio-polymer and the wood cell. This process results in wood cells which are resistant against micro-organisms.
At the moment the only timber specie which is being used for this process is [[Pinus radiata]]. This is the fastest growing tree specie on Earth that has a porous structure,  which is particularly suitable for  impregnation processes.

The technique is applied on timber mainly for the building industry as a cladding material. The technique is being further developed in order to reach similar physical and biological properties of other polyfurfuryl impregnated wood species. 
Besides the impregnation with the biopolymers the timber can also be impregnated with a fire retardant resins. This combination creates a timber with durability class I and with a fire safety  certification of Euro class B.

====Wood acetylation====
[[File:Bridge made from acetylated wood.jpg|thumb|This bridge made from [[acetylated wood]] near [[Sneek]], the [[Netherlands]], is designed to carry heavy traffic.]]
Chemical modification of wood at the molecular level has been used to improve its performance properties. Many chemical reaction systems for the modification of wood, especially those using various types of [[wiktionary:anhydride|anhydrides]], have been published; however, the reaction of wood with [[acetic anhydride]] has been the most studied.&lt;ref&gt;(Rowell et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical properties of any material are determined by its chemical structure. Wood contains an abundance of chemical groups called ''free hydroxyls''. Free hydroxyl groups readily absorb and release water according to changes in the climatic conditions to which they are exposed. This is the main reason why wood's dimensional stability is impacted by swelling and shrinking. It is also believed that the digestion of wood by enzymes initiates at the free hydroxyl sites, which is one of the principal reasons why wood is prone to decay.&lt;ref&gt;Roger M. Rowell, Bert Kattenbroek, Peter Ratering, Ferry Bongers, Francesco Leicher, and Hal Stebbins, "Production of Dimensionally Stable and Decay Resistant Wood Components Based on Acetylation", presented at International Conference on Durability of Building Materials and Components. Istanbul, Turkey, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acetylation]] effectively changes the free hydroxyls within wood into [[acetyl]] groups. This is done by reacting the wood with acetic anhydride, which comes from [[acetic acid]]. When free hydroxyl groups are transformed to acetyl groups, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally stable and, because it is no longer digestible, extremely durable. In general, softwoods naturally have an acetyl content from 0.5 to 1.5% and more durable hardwoods from 2 to 4.5%. Acetylation takes wood well beyond these levels with corresponding benefits. These include an extended coatings life due to acetylated wood acting as a more stable substrate for paints and translucent coatings. [[Acetylated wood]] is non-toxic and does not have the environmental issues associated with traditional preservation techniques.

The acetylation of wood was first done in Germany in 1928 by Fuchs. In 1946, Tarkow, Stamm and Erickson first described the use of wood acetylation to stabilize wood from swelling in water. Since the 1940s, many laboratories around the world have looked at acetylation of many different types of woods and agricultural resources.

In spite of the vast amount of research on chemical modification of wood, and, more specifically, on the acetylation of wood, commercialization did not come easily. The first patent on the acetylation of wood was filed by Suida in Austria in 1930. Later, in 1947, Stamm and Tarkow filed a patent on the acetylation of wood and boards using [[pyridine]] as a catalyst. In 1961, the [[Koppers|Koppers Company]] published a technical bulletin on the acetylation of wood using no catalysis, but with an organic [[cosolvent]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein et al. 1961, Dreher et al. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, in Russia, Otlesnov and Nikitina came close to commercialization, but the process was discontinued, presumably because cost-effectiveness could not be achieved. In 2007, Titan Wood, a London-based company, with production facilities in The Netherlands, achieved cost-effective commercialization and began large-scale production of acetylated wood under the trade name "Accoya".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttjonline.com/story.asp?storycode=49809]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007065425/http://www.ttjonline.com/story.asp?storycode=49809 |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural preservatives===

====Copper plating====
Copper plating or [[Copper sheathing]] is the practice of covering wood most usually wooden hulls of ships with copper metal. As metallic copper is both repellent and toxic to fungus, insects such as termites, and marine bi-valves this would preserve the wood and also act as an anti-fouling measure to prevent aquatic life from attaching to the ship's hull and reducing a ship's speed and maneuverability.

====Naturally rot-resistant woods====
These species are resistant to decay in their natural state, due to high levels of organic chemicals called ''extractives'', mainly [[polyphenol]]s. Extractives are chemicals that are deposited in the [[heartwood]] of certain tree species as they convert [[Heartwood|sapwood]] to [[heartwood]]. [[Lagarostrobos|Huon pine]] (''Lagarostrobos franklinii''), merbau (''[[Intsia bijuga]]''), [[ironbark]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' spp.), tōtara (''[[Podocarpus totara]]''), [[puriri]] (''Vitex lucens''), kauri (''[[Agathis australis]]''), and many [[Cupressaceae|cypresses]], such as [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') and western red cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]''), fall in this category. However, many of these species tend to be prohibitively expensive for general construction applications.

[[Huon pine]] was used for ship hulls in the 19th century, but over-harvesting and Huon pine's extremely slow growth rate makes this now a speciality timber. Huon pine is so rot resistant, that fallen trees from many years ago are still commercially valuable.

[[Merbau]] is still a popular decking timber and has a long life in above ground applications, but it is logged in an [[illegal logging|unsustainable manner]] and is too hard and brittle for general use.

[[Ironbark]] is a good choice where available. It is harvested from both old-growth and plantation in [[Australia]] and is highly resistant to [[decomposition|rot]] and [[termite]]s. It is most commonly used for fence posts and house stumps.

Eastern red cedar (''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'') and black locust (''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'') have long been used for rot-resistant fence posts and rails in [[eastern United States]], with the black locust also planted in modern times in Europe. Coast redwood is commonly used for similar applications in the [[western United States]].

[[Tōtara]] and [[puriri]] were used extensively in [[New Zealand]] during the [[Europe]]an colonial era when native forests were "mined", even as fence posts of which many are still operating. Tōtara was used by the [[Māori people|Māori]] to build large ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]'' (canoes). Today, they are specialty timbers as a result of their scarcity, although lower grade stocks are sold for landscaping use.

[[Agathis australis|Kauri]] is a superb timber for building the hulls and decks of boats. It too is now a specialty timber and ancient logs (in excess of 3,000 years) that have been mined from swamps are used by wood turners and furniture makers.

The natural durability or rot and insect resistance of wood species is always based on the heartwood (or "truewood"). The sapwood of all timber species should be considered to be non-durable without preservative treatment.

====Tung oil====
[[Tung oil]] has been used for hundreds of years in [[China]], where it was used as a preservative for wood ships. The oil penetrates the wood, and then hardens to form an impermeable [[hydrophobic]] layer up to 5&amp;nbsp;mm into the wood. As a preservative it is effective for exterior work above and below ground, but the thin layer makes it less useful in practice. It is not available as a pressure treatment.

====Heat treatments====
{{Main|Thermally modified wood}}
By going beyond [[kiln drying]] wood, heat treatment may make timber more durable. By heating timber to a certain temperature, it may be possible to make the wood fibre less appetizing to insects.

Heat treatment can also improve the properties of the wood with respect to water, with lower equilibrium moisture, less moisture deformation, and weather resistance. It is weather-resistant enough to be used unprotected, in facades or in kitchen tables, where wetting is expected.

There are four similar heat treatments&amp;nbsp;— Westwood, developed in the United States; Retiwood, developed in France; Thermowood, developed in Finland by VTT; and Platowood, developed in The Netherlands. These processes autoclave the treated wood, subjecting it to pressure and heat, along with [[nitrogen]] or water vapour to control drying in a staged treatment process ranging from 24 to 48 hours at temperatures of 180&amp;nbsp;°C to 230&amp;nbsp;°C depending on timber species. These processes increase the durability, dimensional stability and hardness of the treated wood by at least one class; however, the treated wood is darkened in colour, and there are changes in certain mechanical characteristics: Specifically, the modulus of elasticity is increased to 10%,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and the modulus of rupture is diminished by 5% to 20%;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} thus, the treated wood requires drilling for nailing to avoid splitting the wood. Certain of these processes cause less impact than others in their mechanical effects upon the treated wood. Wood treated with this process is often used for cladding or siding, flooring, furniture and windows.

For the control of pests that may be harbored in wood packaging material (i.e. [[crate]]s and [[pallet]]s), the [[ISPM 15]] requires heat treatment of wood to 56&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 minutes to receive the [[ISPM 15#ISPM Marking|HT stamp]]. This is typically required to ensure the killing of the [[pine wilt nematode]] and other kinds of wood pests that could be transported internationally.

====Mud treatment====
Wood and [[bamboo]] can be buried in [[mud]] to help protect them from insects and decay. This practice is used widely in [[Vietnam]] to build farm houses consisting of a wooden structural frame, a bamboo roof frame and bamboo with mud mixed with rice hay for the walls. While wood in contact with soil will generally decompose more quickly than wood not in contact with it, it is possible that the predominantly clay soils prevalent in Vietnam provide a degree of mechanical protection against insect attack, which compensates for the accelerated rate of decay.

Also, since wood is only subject to bacterial decay under specific temperature and moisture content ranges, submerging it in water-saturated mud can retard decay, by saturating the wood's internal cells beyond their moisture decay range.

==Application processes==

===Introduction and history===
Probably the first attempts made to protect wood from decay and insect attack consisted of brushing or rubbing preservatives onto the surfaces of the treated wood. Through [[trial and error]] the most effective preservatives and application processes were slowly determined. In the Industrial Revolution, demands for such things as [[Utility pole|telegraph poles]] and [[railroad tie]]s (UK: railway sleepers) helped to fuel an explosion of new techniques that emerged in the early 19th century. The sharpest rise in inventions took place between 1830 and 1840, when Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan were making wood-preserving history. Since then, numerous processes have been introduced or existing processes improved. The goal of modern-day wood preservation is to ensure a deep, uniform penetration with reasonable cost, without endangering the environment. The most widespread application processes today are those using artificial pressure through which many woods are being effectively treated, but several species (such as spruce, Douglas-fir, larch, hemlock and fir) are very resistant to impregnation. With the use of incising, the treatment of these woods has been somewhat successful but with a higher cost and not always satisfactory results. One can divide the wood-preserving methods roughly into either non-pressure processes or pressure processes.

===Non-pressure processes===
There are numerous non-pressure processes of treating wood which vary primarily in their procedure. The most common of these treatments involve the application of the preservative by means of brushing or spraying, dipping, soaking, steeping or by means of hot and cold bath. There is also a variety of additional methods involving charring, applying preservatives in bored holes, diffusion processes and sap displacement.

====Brush and spray treatments====
Brushing preservatives is a long-practised method and often used in today's carpentry workshops. Technological developments mean it is also possible to spray preservative over the surface of the timber. Some of the liquid is drawn into the wood as the result of capillary action before the spray runs off or evaporates, but unless puddling occurs penetration is limited and may not be suitable for long-term weathering. By using the spray method, coal-tar creosote, oil-borne solutions and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied. A thorough brush or spray treatment with coal-tar creosote can add 1 to 3 years to the lifespan of poles or posts. Two or more coats provide better protection than one, but the successive coats should not be applied until the prior coat has dried or soaked into the wood. The wood should be [[seasoning (wood)|seasoned]] before treatment.

====Dipping====
Dipping consists of simply immersing the wood in a bath of creosote or other preservative for a few seconds or minutes. Similar penetrations to that of brushing and spraying processes are achieved. It has the advantage of minimizing hand labor. It requires more equipment and larger quantities of preservative and is not adequate for treating small lots of timber. Usually the dipping process is useful in the treatment of window sashes and doors. Except for copper naphthenate, treatment with copper salt preservative is no longer allowed with this method.

====Steeping====
In this process the wood is submerged in a tank of water-preservative mix, and allowed to soak for a longer period of time (several days to weeks). This process was developed in the 19th century by [[John Howard Kyan|John Kyan]]. The depth and retention achieved depends on factors such as species, wood moisture, preservative and soak duration. The majority of the absorption takes place during the first two or three days, but will continue at a slower pace for an indefinite period. As a result, the longer the wood can be left in the solution, the better treatment it will receive. When treating seasoned timber, both the water and the preservative salt soak into the wood, making it necessary to season the wood a second time. Posts and poles can be treated directly on endangered areas, but should be treated at least {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} above the future ground level.

The depth obtained during regular steeping periods varies from {{convert|5|to|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} by sap pine. Due to the low absorption, solution strength should be somewhat stronger than that in pressure processes, around 5% for seasoned timber and 10% for green timber (because the concentration slowly decreases as the chemicals diffuse into the wood). The solution strength should be controlled continually and, if necessary, be corrected with the salt additive. After the timber is removed from the treatment tank, the chemical will continue to spread within the wood if it has sufficient moisture content. The wood should be weighed down and piled so that the solution can reach all surfaces. (Sawed materials stickers should be placed between every board layer.) This process finds minimal use despite its former popularity in continental [[Europe]] and [[Great Britain]].

====Kyanizing====
Named after [[John Howard Kyan]], who patented this process in [[England]] in 1833, Kyanizing consists of steeping wood in a 0.67% [[mercuric chloride]] preservative solution. It is no longer used.

====Gedrian's Bath====
Patented by Charles A. Seely, this process achieves treatment by immersing seasoned wood in successive baths of hot and cold preservatives. During the hot baths, the air expands in the timbers. When the timbers are changed to the cold bath (the preservative can also be changed) a partial vacuum is created within the lumen of the cells, causing the preservative to be drawn into the wood. Some penetration occurs during the hot baths, but most of it takes place during the cold baths. This cycle is repeated with a significant time reduction compared to other steeping processes. Each bath may last 4 to 8 hours or in some cases longer. The temperature of the preservative in the hot bath should be between {{convert|60|to|110|C|F}} and {{convert|30|to|40|C|F}} in the cold bath (depending on preservative and tree species). The average penetration depths achieved with this process ranges from {{convert|30|to|50|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Both preservative oils and water-soluble salts can be used with this treatment. Due to the longer treatment periods, this method finds little use in the commercial wood preservation industry today.

====Preservative Precipitation====
As explained in Uhlig's Corrosion Handbook, this process involves two or more chemical baths that undergo a reaction with the cells of the wood, and result in the precipitation of preservative into the wood cells. Two chemicals commonly employed in this process are Copper Ethanolamine, and Sodium Dimethyldithiocarbamate, which reacts to precipitate Copper Dimetyldithiocarbamate. The precipitated preservative is very resistant to leeching. Since its use in the mid 1990s, it has been discontinued in the United States of America, however it never saw commercialization in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;click here to close

===Pressure processes===
[[File:History of the West End street railway, in which is included sketches of the early street railway of Boston- consolidation of the various lines- foreign street railways- the Berlin viaduct- anecdotes, (14574244810).jpg|thumb|Late 19th century pressure treatment]]

Pressure processes are the most permanent method around today in preserving timber life. Pressure processes are those in which the treatment is carried out in closed cylinders with applied pressure or vacuum. These processes have a number of advantages over the non-pressure methods. In most cases, a deeper and more uniform penetration and a higher absorption of preservative is achieved. Another advantage is that the treating conditions can be controlled so that retention and penetration can be varied. These pressure processes can be adapted to large-scale production. The high initial costs for equipment and the energy costs are the biggest disadvantages. These treatment methods are used to protect ties, poles and structural timbers and find use throughout the world today. The various pressure processes that are used today differ in details, but the general method is in all cases the same. The treatment is carried out in cylinders. The timbers are loaded onto special tram cars, so called ''buggies'' or ''bogies'', and into the cylinder. These cylinders are then set under pressure often with the addition of higher temperature. As final treatment, a vacuum is frequently used to extract excess preservatives. These cycles can be repeated to achieve better penetration.

LOSP treatments often use a vacuum impregnation process. This is possible because of the lower viscosity of the white-spirit carrier used.

====Full-cell process====
In the full-cell process, the intent is to keep as much of the liquid absorbed into the wood during the pressure period as possible, thus leaving the maximum concentration of preservatives in the treated area. Usually, water solutions of preservative salts are employed with this process, but it is also possible to impregnate wood with oil. The desired retention is achieved by changing the strength of the solution. William Burnett patented this development in 1838 of full-cell impregnation with water solutions. The patent covered the use of zinc chloride on water basis, also known as ''Burnettizing''. A full-cell process with oil was patented in 1838 by John Bethell. His patent described the injection of tar and oils into wood by applying pressure in closed cylinders. This process is still used today with some improvements.

====Fluctuation pressure process====
Contrary to the static full-cell and empty-cell processes, the fluctuation process is a dynamic process. By this process the pressure inside the impregnation cylinder changes between pressure and vacuum within a few seconds. There have been inconsistent claims that through this process it is possible to reverse the pit closure by spruce. However, the best results that have been achieved with this process by spruce do not exceed a penetration deeper than {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Specialized equipment is necessary and therefore higher investment costs are incurred.

====Boucherie process====
Developed by Dr. Boucherie of France in 1838, this approach consisted of attaching a bag or container of preservative solution to a standing or a freshly cut tree with bark, branches, and leaves still attached, thereby injecting the liquid into the sap stream. Through transpiration of moisture from the leaves the preservative is drawn upward through the sapwood of the tree trunk.

The modified Boucherie process consists of placing freshly cut, unpeeled timbers onto declining skids, with the stump slightly elevated, then fastening watertight covering caps or boring a number of holes into the ends, and inserting a solution of copper sulfate or other waterborne preservative into the caps or holes from an elevated container. Preservative oils tend to not penetrate satisfactorily by this method. The hydrostatic pressure of the liquid forces the preservative lengthwise into and through the sapwood, thus pushing the sap out of the other end of the timber. After a few days, the sapwood is completely impregnated; unfortunately little or no penetration takes place in the heartwood. Only green wood can be treated in this manner. This process has found considerable usage to impregnate poles and also larger trees in Europe and North America, and has experienced a revival of usage to impregnate bamboo in countries such as Costa Rica, Bangladesh, India and the state of Hawaii.

====High-pressure sap displacement system====
Developed in the Philippines, this method (abbreviated HPSD) consists of a cylinder pressure cap made from a 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick mild steel plate secured with 8 sets of bolts, a 2-HP diesel engine, and a pressure regulator with 1.4–14&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; capacity. The cap is placed over the stump of a pole, tree or bamboo and the preservative is forced into the wood with pressure from the engine.

===Incising===
First tested and patented by Kolossvary, Haltenberger, and Berdenich of Austria in 1911 and 1912 (U.S. patents. 1,012,207 and 1,018,624) with several improvements from O. P. M. Goss, D. W. Edwards and J. H. Mansfield among others, this process consists of making shallow, slit-like holes in the surfaces of material to be treated, so that deeper and more uniform penetration of preventative may be obtained. The term ''incising'' or perforating comes from the Latin ''incidere'', a compound of ''in'' and ''caedere'' (to cut). Incisions made in sawed material usually are parallel with the grain of the wood. This process is common in North America (since the 1950s), where Douglas-fir products and pole butts of various species are prepared before treatment. It is most useful for woods that are resistant to side penetration, but allow preservative transport along the grain. In the region in which it is produced, it is common practice to incise all sawed Douglas-fir {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} or more in thickness before treatment.

Unfortunately, the impregnation of spruce, the most important structural timber in large areas in Europe, has shown that unsatisfactory treatment depths have been achieved with impregnation. The maximum penetration of {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} is not sufficient to protect wood in weathered positions. The present-day incising machines consist essentially of four revolving drums fitted with teeth or needles or with lasers that burn the incisions into the wood. Preservatives can be spread along the grain up to {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} in radial and up to {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} in tangential and radial direction.

In North America, where smaller timber dimensions are common, incision depths of {{convert|4|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} have become standard. In Europe, where larger dimensions are widespread, incision depths of {{convert|10|to|12|mm|abbr=on}} are necessary. The incisions are visible and often considered to be wood error. Incisions by laser are significantly smaller than those of spokes or needles. The costs for each process type are approximately for spoke/conventional all-round incising €0.50/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, by laser incising €3.60/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and by needle incision €1.00/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (Figures originate from the year 1998 and may vary from present day prices.)

===Microwaving===
An alternative increases the [[permeability (fluid)|permeability]] of timber using microwave technology. There is some concern that this method may adversely affect the structural performance of the material. Research in this area has been conducted by the Cooperative Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

===Charring===
[[Charring]] of timber results in surfaces which are fire-resistant, insect-resistant and proof against weathering. Wood surfaces are ignited using a hand-held burner or moved slowly across a fire. The charred surface is then cleaned using a steel brush to remove loose bits and to expose the grain. Oil or varnish may be applied if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campinglifequest.com/diy/japanese-technique-of-preservingantiquin|title=DIY - Off The Grid|author=|date=|website=Off Grid Quest|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan this traditional technique is called ''[[yakisugi]]'' or ''shō sugi ban''.

The '''''École européenne de chimie, polymères et matériaux''''' ('''ECPM'''; European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials Science) of Strasbourg is a public engineering school in the city of [[Strasbourg, France|Strasbourg]], in [[Alsace, France|Alsace]], [[France]]. It was founded in 1948, and is located on the Cronenbourg Campus of the [[University of Strasbourg]].  Each year 90 students graduate from the school with a [[diplôme d'ingénieur]]. It is a National School of Engineers, part of the University of Strasbourg and a member of the [[:fr:Fédération Gay-Lussac|Fédération Gay-Lussac]], which recruits from the common polytechnic entrance examination. It is also part of the Alsace Tech network of nine engineering schools in Alsace. The ECPM offers its students three specialties: [[chemistry]] ([[analytical chemistry|analytical]] or [[organic chemistry|organic]]), [[polymer science|polymers]] or [[material science|materials]].

== History ==

''1919'' -
Creation of the chemical institute by the professors T.Muller and H.Gault. Lectures are taught rue Goethe in Strasbourg.

''1948'' -
Creation at the same place of the Ecole nationale supérieure de chimie (ENSCS) by the professor H. Forestier.

''1962'' -
The Ecole de chimie has place in new premises (tour de la Chimie) on the [[:fr:campus central de l'Esplanade|campus central de l'Esplanade]]. The first practical sessions from the ENSCS in analytical chemistry begin at the start of the school year 1962.

''1968'' -
The ENSCS becomes a public organization.

''1981'' -
The professor M. Daire introduces the European teaching program.

''1986'' -
The ENSCS becomes Ecole Européenne des hautes études des industries chimiques de Strasbourg (EHICS)

''1995'' -
The EHICS, the Ecole d'application des hauts Polymères and the Magistère matériaux de l'université de Strasbourg-I group together and form the Ecole de chimie, Polymères et Matériaux (ECPM).

''1998-1999'' -
The ECPM moves to new premises on the University's Cronenbourg campus.

''2006'' -
Strasbourg becomes [[business cluster]] of the French chemistry.

''2009'' -
The [[:fr:Université Louis Pasteur|université Louis Pasteur]] and the other universities of Strasbourg are joined and form l'[[:fr:Université de Strasbourg|Université de Strasbourg]]

''2011'' -
Opening of the new Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale (CP2I) - CHEM.I.ST. at the start of the school year 2011.

== Admission to ECPM ==

→ To enter the First year:

- The school recruit essentially with the «Concours Communs Polytechniques» (CCP) or the DEUG (which are national competitive exams).

- The admission could also be done by an interview with a License 3 in Chemistry or in Physics at the university, a DUT (university diploma of technology) for example, in Chemistry,  physical measurements optional materials or chemical engineering.

- For international students, they must have a Bachelor of science or an equivalent foreign degree.

- After 2 years in CPI classes at Rennes (ENSCR), Lille(ENSCL), Clermont-Ferrand (ENSCCF) or in Strasbourg (ECPM: referred to the CPI classe's paragraph).

→ To enter the Second year, students can have access at the ECPM having an interview, with a Master M1 in Physics with a speciality in Polymers or materials.

→ Admission to the CP2i class in the ECPM, after the Baccalaureate, or an equivalent foreign degree for the international students.

There is no competitive exam, but every student should submit their school results. Then there are interviews to evaluate the motivations with the people in charge of the Chem.I.St programme. Approximately 50 students are selected every year. There are nearly 20% international students.

== CP2I / Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale ==

This class allows the students to gain admission to a school of the Fédération Gay Lussac (19 schools) after two years. These 2 years consist of studying engineer's trades in the domain of chemistry.

There are 5 CPIs in France: Rennes, Clermont-Ferrand, Lille, Pau and Strasbourg at the ECPM

The last one was opened at the start of the 2011-12 school year in Strasbourg. The speciality of this school is that it welcomes a large number of international students, as well as that 20% of the courses are delivered in English and 10% are delivered in German (optional). There are 50 students in each year.

To gain admission to the CP2I:

* French students register on Admission Post-Bac and follow the steps.

Students are selected on the basis of their academic record and a 20-minute interview.

* International students submit their dossiers directly to the school.

International students are also selected on the basis of their academic record and an interview.

General presentation of CPI-CHEM.I.ST :

* A strong scientific program: a major part of chemistry, physics and maths during the 2 years with a total, for the first year, of around 700 hours of scientific lesson. We must add Lab Work of this scientific formation, with a total of 102 hours for the first year. 
The CPI-CHEM.I.ST base of more practical work than in an intensive foundation degree, with high-quality laboratory. The program includes group work to develop the communication, the creativity around scientists projects. Moreover, in 2016, a "videxo" program was created. During, the "videxo" student solves a science problem on a board and in the same time someone films him to send the video to the teachers. The goal of this is to promote self-confidence, speaking, and the scientist reflexion which are important qualities for the future engineer.

* An international program in a multicultural environment: many students with different cultures and two foreign languages to learn. At the beginning of the formation, students can participate in an English language session for one week in order to learn the fundamentals of the scientific English. Insertions travels are organised at the end of the first year in Germany or in England. The students will participate in lectures and lab work in a foreign university. Most of the time the foreign students come from China.

==Speciality==
The speciality is chosen in the second year. Students have four possibilities:

'''Chemistry''':

Organic Chemistry: With this speciality, students attain a high level in synthesis and characterization of organic chemistry.

Analytical Chemistry:  Students are trained in techniques of analysis within the context of quality control.

'''Polymers''':  Students are trained to become flexible engineers in the polymer industry.

'''Materials''':  Students are trained in physics and chemistry of functional materials. Students become engineers specializing in conception and development of materials with an added value.

==Community life==

There are several associations managed by school's students :

- '''l'Amicale''' (BDE) (or ''Student Union'' ): It manages the associative and festive life of the school, organizes students foyer's functioning, publishes students' directory and organizes events like, for example, new students integration's weekend. About ten clubs exist in the association like the Arts' Office, DéméTerre (sustainable development), Theatre Club, Manga Club, Cine Club, Gastronomy Club, study trip, etc.

- Le '''Bureau des Sports''' (BDS° (or  '''Sports Office''') : It allows students to do sport, to participate in university competitions and organizes events like a nice trip at the month for a weekend or at the [[:fr:Tournoi Inter-Chimie|Tournoi Inter-Chimie]] (TIC) in spring. Moreover, the ECPM won this sports and festive event in 2006 which has been organized in Mulhouse.

- Le "'''Forum Horizon Chimie"''' (FHC) : It's the ECPM's association that organize a forum which happens every year at la [[:fr:Maison de la Chimie|Maison de la Chimie]] in Paris.

Moreover, a junior company, Strasbourg Chimie Service, allows students-employed to make some punctual missions like chemical analyses, scientific conferences or translations of publications.

It also exists '''l'Amicale des Ingénieurs de Chimie de Strasbourg''' (Association of the Strasbourg's Engineers of Chemistry). It's an association aiming at conservation and relations' strengthening between graduates and students. It has in particular for ultimate objective the creation of a robust and big network ECPM, a very great tool for a successful career.

-'''Student common room'''

The ECPM Student common room is the center of the school. It is a place where students can relax after lunch or during off-peak times. 
It is a big place where you can find a table football, a billiard table, many couches and tables and even a microwave. In fact, it is possible to eat food you’ve brought.  Moreover, there is a mezzanine with a hi-fi system, which makes you think of a nightclub and a terrace which is surrounded by trees and is really cozy.
Everyone has the right to go to the student common room, the students in the engineering cycle and the CPI’s. Furthermore, the BDE and the BDS (respectively student union and sports office) sometime organize parties in the student common room (for example barbecues) to bring the whole school together. For example, there is the Welcome Party every year for new students.

==Partners and networks==

The ECPM  participated to many different networks in order to communicate with factories, institutions or students.

That different networks are :

-The Gay- Lussac federation: The federation was found by Louis Joseph Gay Lussac.  It regroups no more than 19 schools of chemistry and chemical engineering. These 19 schools, through their teaching activities, research and training, are working together to raise awareness, develop and promote engineering courses in chemistry.

-The network “Alsace Tech“:  Alsace Tech regroups 12 reputed engineering, management and architecture schools of Alsace. Its main objective is to promote, to contribute to the national and international influence and to increase the legibility of its schools' members.

== Scientific Research ==

The ECPM is a hub for scientific research. Five laboratories associated with the [[:en:CNRS|CNRS]] form the ECPM's research federation. The fields of research are varied: materials, catalysis, polymers, organic synthesis, analysis of biomolecules. The laboratories collaborate with industries and major European research organizations as part of European agreements. A 1000m² hall with a [[cleanroom]] further the exchanges with industry.

'''Associated Laboratories'''

- The SYBIO Laboratory (Synthèse Organique et Molécules Bioactives)

- Laboratoire de Chimie Bioorganique et Médicale

- The Nierengarten group

- Laboratoire de Synthèse et Catalyse Asymétrique (SynCat)

- Laboratoire de Chimie organométallique

== Food services ==

You can find different kinds of food services in and around the campus.

- '''Restaurant universitaire (RU)''': this is the place where the majority of the students come everyday.  The choice is between three different main courses: today's special, world's dish, and the grill. Patrons can also take a starter and a dessert, the whole for 3€15. Dining is in a large room with all the campus' students: CPI, engineers, and students of the IUT Louis Pasteur.

- '''Mini R''' : It's a new concept ! It's located above the RU. The principle is the same as a cafeteria. You choose what you want: sandwiches, fagotine, fruits, desserts, drinks, and some hot food like pizzas, paninis, pasta and wok boxes, kebab, hot dog, etc. One can eat there or take away.

- '''Vending machine''':  in the school, next to the coffee machine. There are several kinds of sandwiches, but all of them are industrial.

- '''In the common room''': it is mainly the place where the engineers eat because they are contributors (prices are less expansive for them). For those bringing food from their flat, you can warm up there; there are ovens and stovetops.

- '''Fast food and supermarkets''': Finally, there is an area next to the IUT Louis Pasteur with fast food like Mac Donald, Mezzo di Pasta or supermarkets (Liddl, Intermarché).

== Ranking ==

According to the ''Point'' newspaper, the ECPM was ranked 18th in 2007 and was the leading chemistry schools in that rank (excluding chemical engineering) before the ENSCP which occupied the 30th rank. According to ''L'Express'', the school was ranked 27th as a ''post-prépa'' engineering school in 2008, behind the National School of Chemistry of Paris in the category of chemistry schools. Concerning starting incomes, the ECPM was ranked 10th by ''L'Usine Nouvelle'' in 2007. In the same newspaper, the ECPM is ranked 6th as a school betting on self-knowledge, that is to say, a school devoting a large part to non-scientific lectures.
