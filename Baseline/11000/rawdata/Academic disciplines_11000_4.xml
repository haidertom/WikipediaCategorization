'''Acotyledon''' is used to refer to [[seed plant]]s or spermatophytes that lack [[cotyledon]]s, such as [[orchid]]s and [[dodder]]. Orchid seeds are tiny with underdeveloped embryos. They depend on [[mycorrhizal fungi]] for their early nutrition so are [[myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophs]] at that stage.

Although some authors, especially in the 19th century and earlier, use the word acotyledon to include plants which have no cotyledons because they lack seeds entirely (such as [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution-url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=acotyledon |contribution=acotyledon |url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1913 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710101105/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Znw-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=acotyledon+Cuscuta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B-W0cC6Xnq&amp;sig=TgueUvNSVcfbZ_0fIrtS4JNqE1s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1uMTS4yoMoK9lAeVssGEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAw | contribution = acotyledons | title = A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art | author = William Thomas Brande | year = 1842 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H_MCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=acotyledon+Cuscuta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ar5j3x_CIM&amp;sig=LVVlrsnlHqxiGUsZWcQNQsQMBCk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1uMTS4yoMoK9lAeVssGEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwCQ | contribution = acotyledons | title = The treasury of botany | editor = John Lindley, Thomas Moore | year = 1866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others restrict the term to plants which have seeds but no cotyledons.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=acotyledon&amp;use1828=on | contribution = acotyledon | title = American Dictionary of the English Language | author = [[Noah Webster]] | year = 1828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flowering plants]] or angiosperms are divided into two large groups. [[Monocotyledon]]s or monocots have one seed lobe, which is often modified to absorb stored nutrients from the seed so never emerges from the seed or becomes photosynthetic. [[Dicotyledon]]s or dicots have two cotyledons and often germinate to produce two leaf-like cotyledons. [[Conifers]] and other [[gymnosperm]]s lack flowers but may have two or more cotyledons in the seedling.

An '''acting coach''' or '''drama coach''' is a [[teacher]] who trains performers–typically film, television, theatre and, [[musical theatre]] [[actor]]s–and gives them advice and [[mentoring]] to enable them to improve their acting and dramatic performances, prepare for [[audition]]s and prepare better for roles.
==Qualifications and roles==
Acting coaches need to have a "talent...for reading people, all their utterances and [[body language]]."&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Eric Liu. "The People Whisperers:What a Hollywood acting coach taught me about teaching" in Slate. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/teachings/2005/01/the_people_whisperers.html&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coaches have been called "people whisperers", a reference to "[[horse whisperer]]s" who help to train animals.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coach [[Ivana Chubbuck]] states that one of her roles is to ensure that "every actor...must know what the character's objective is in a scene—to win someone's love, respect, sympathy, whatever—and then must have a ruthlessness about achieving the objective."&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Chubbuck works with actors to help them to connect with the emotion inside the character.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coaches also "...help [drama] students audition for college".&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;Regan McMahon. "THEATER Acting coach preps drama students for college auditions" in ''The Chronicle'' Saturday, January 22, 2011 http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Acting-coaches-help-students-audition-for-college-2478509.php&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coach and actor Woodell-Mascall is "...skilled at zeroing in on what young actors need to do to improve their performance." Woodell-Mascall tells one student actor to "...really think about who [the character] is and what she's feeling. It's got to be real.&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; She provides [[constructive criticism]] to students. Woodell-Mascall has helped students to get into drama programs at schools "...including NYU, Juilliard, Rutgers and UCLA".&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; Some acting coaches use an "...approach and technique of acting training [that] are considered established, proven methods of creating the [dramatic] work", such as using the "...methodology of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Lee Strasberg]], and [[Sanford Meisner]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://kimtobinactingstudio.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some acting coaches provide students with a DVD or SD card recording of their acting, for the student to review their progress.

==Notable individuals==
Major acting coaches include: [[Larry Moss (acting coach)|Larry Moss]], [[Ivana Chubbuck]], [[Michelle Danner]], [[Terry Schreiber]], [[David Mamet]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Michael Woolson]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Chambers Stevens]], and [[Sanford Meisner]].

==Working conditions==
Acting coaches may be freelancers who are hired for an hourly or daily rate, or they may be hired on a longer-term basis by a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or [[theatre company]]. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top [[Hollywood]] celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over [[Skype]] or other video linkups. Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both.

==Other roles==
In some cases, acting coaches are hired to train [[singer]]s in acting skills. Popular music singers may need to learn acting skills for their live concert shows, which sometimes include staged sequences, and for performing in [[music video]]s. For example, Goth-rocker [[Amy Lee]] was provided with an acting coach by her record label. In [[Classical music]], singers performing staged [[opera]]s may get help from an acting coach to prepare them for their roles. Sometimes CEOs and other leaders hire acting coaches to help them improve their performance of speeches and other general communications activities. While most acting coaches mentor actors, some also coach directors on how to improve their direction of actors. Some acting coaches offer introductions to the acting industry, to help new actors learn about auditions, the casting process, the role of agents, key acting terminology (e.g., "[[wikt:callback|callback]]" auditions), and about important industry organizations.

'''Animal nutrition''' focuses on the dietary needs of [[animals]], primarily those in [[agriculture]] and food production, but also in zoos, aquariums, and wildlife management.

There are seven major classes of [[nutrient]]s: [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fibre]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]].

==Constituents of diet==
Macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7167-4684-0 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]]. [[Essential amino acids]] cannot be made by the animal. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation.

Other dietary substances found in plant foods ([[phytochemicals]], [[polyphenol]]s) are not identified as essential nutrients but appear to impact health in both positive and negative ways. Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt provides sodium and chloride, both essential nutrients, but will cause illness or even death in too large amounts.

Dietary fibre is a [[carbohydrate]] (polysaccharide or oligosaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in some animals. 

===Protein===
Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which are characterized by the inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulfur. The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). 

A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]; this is done in quantity only during starvation.

===Minerals===
Dietary [[Mineral (nutrient)|mineral]]s are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet.

Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually  called "bulk minerals". Some are structural, but many play a role as [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, D. L. |author2=Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=1-57259-153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally structural (for muscle and digestive system health, bones, some forms neutralizes acidity, may help clear toxins, and provide signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity)
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=0-444-89307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health)
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte
* [[Sulfur]] for three amino acids and therefore many proteins (skin, hair, nails, liver, and pancreas)

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=0-935702-73-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins===
[[Vitamin]] deficiencies may result in disease conditions. Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health (notably [[vitamin A]]), and animal nutrition researchers have managed to establish safe levels for some common companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;Morris PJ, Salt C, Raila J, Brenten T, Kohn B, Schweigert FJ, Zentek J. Safety evaluation of vitamin A in growing dogs. British Journal of Nutrition. 2012; 108(10):1800-1809.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences.

==Ash==
Though not really a nutrient as such, an entry for ''ash'' is sometimes found on nutrition labels, especially for [[pet food]].  This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600&amp;nbsp;°C.  Thus, it does not include water, fibre, and nutrients that provide calories, but it does include some nutrients, such as minerals &lt;ref&gt;Purina; [http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F The Facts About Dietary Ash] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050811/http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F |date=July 21, 2011 }}; last checked 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Too much ash may contribute to [[feline urological syndrome]] in [[domestic cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Glenn Brown; [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1680954 Low ash cat foods: The role of magnesium in feline nutrition]; Canadian Veterinary Journal 1989 January 30(1): 73–79; last checked 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intestinal bacterial flora==
Animal [[intestine]]s contain a large population of [[gut flora]] which are essential to [[digestion]], and are also affected by the food eaten.

[[Adriaan Reland]], professor of philosophy at the [[University of Harderwijk]], was one of the early [[Orientalists]], teaching Hebrew antiquities from 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Power And Religion in Baroque Rome: Barberini Cultural Policies, P.

The foundations of biblical archaeology were laid in the 19th century with the work of antiquarians such as [[Johann Jahn]], whose manual of biblical antiquities, ''Biblische Archäologie'', (1802, translated into English 1839) was immensely influential in the middle years of the 19th century. Shortly thereafter, [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]], known as ''the founder of modern [[Palestinology]]'' published the bestselling ''Biblical Researches in Palestine, the Sinai, Petrae and Adjacent Regions'' (1841), which prompted a group of English clergymen and scholars to found the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] "to promote research into the archaeology and history, manners and customs and culture, topography, geology and natural sciences of biblical Palestine and the Levant" in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/intro.htm |title=Palestine Exploration Fund website, Introduction to the PEF |access-date=2008-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013184724/http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/intro.htm |archive-date=2008-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Deutscher Palästina-Verein (1877) and the École Biblique (1890). The [[American School of Oriental Research]] was founded in (1900), and the British School of Archaeology in (1919). The research these institutions sponsored, at least in these early days, was primarily geographic, and it was not until the 1890s that [[Sir Flinders Petrie]] introduced the basic principles of scientific excavation, including [[stratigraphy]] and ceramic typology to Palestinian archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Noel Freedman and Bruce E.

==William F. Albright and the Biblical Archaeology school==

The dominant figure in 20th-century biblical archaeology, defining its scope and creating the mid-century consensus on the relationship between archaeology, the Bible, and the history of ancient Israel, was [[William F. Albright]]. An American with roots in the American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] tradition (his parents were Methodist missionaries in Chile), Director of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), (now the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research) through the 1920s and 1930s, editor of ASOR's ''Bulletin'' until 1968, and author of over a thousand books and articles, Albright drew biblical archaeology into the contemporary debates over the origins and reliability of the Bible. In the early decades of the 20th century this debate was dominated by the [[documentary hypothesis]]. This explained the Bible as the composite product of authors working between the 10th and 5th centuries BC, and raised the question of whether the books of the bible could be regarded as a reliable source of information for Solomon’s period or earlier."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2964 J. Maxwell Miller, "History or Legend", ''The Christian Century'', February 24, 2004, p. 42–47. From religion-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; European scholars such as [[Hermann Gunkel]], [[Albrecht Alt]] and [[Martin Noth]] were suggesting that the books of the Old Testament rested on a body of oral tradition that reflected genuine history, but could not themselves be regarded as historically accurate. Albright saw archaeology as the a practical means to test these ideas. Biblical archaeology, for him, therefore embraced all lands and any finds that could "throw some light, directly or indirectly, on the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1x9Rs_zdG8C&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=3o1l2HUOAt&amp;sig=nfMz5JF3CDVKi9bFJu3ZyoLwQyE&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Droger%2Bmoorey%2BA%2BCentury%2Bof%2BBiblical%2BArchaeology%2B%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title#PPA54,M1  Peter Moorey, "A Century of Biblical Archaeology", p.54ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

Albright and his followers believed that archaeology could and should be used to shed light on the Biblical narrative, particularly the [[Old Testament]]. The influential academic positions held by Albright and his followers, and their immense output&amp;nbsp;— Albright alone was the author of over a thousand books and articles&amp;nbsp;— made their work highly influential, especially in America, and especially among ordinary Christians who wished to believe that archaeology had proved the Bible true. In fact the members of the school were not [[biblical literalism|biblical literalists]], and their main concern was to discriminate between those parts of the biblical story that were true and those that were embellishments.

By the middle of the 20th century the work of Albright and his students, notably [[Nelson Glueck]], [[E. A. Speiser]], [[G. Ernest Wright]] and [[Cyrus Gordon]], had produced a consensus that biblical archaeology had provided physical evidence for the originating historical events behind the Old Testament narratives: in the words of Albright, "Discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details of the Bible as a source of history."&lt;ref&gt;W.F.Albright, The Archaeology of Palestine, 1954 edition, p. 128, quoted in [http://www.gcts.edu/communications/contact/bibarch/archpdf/kaiser.pdf Walter F. Kaiser, "What Good is Biblical Archaeology to Bible Readers?", ''Contact'' magazine, Winter 05/06, at gctuedu.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407063802/http://www.gcts.edu/communications/contact/bibarch/archpdf/kaiser.pdf |date=2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus allowed the creation of authoritative textbooks such as [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]]'s ''History of Israel'' (1959).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;dq=john+bright+history+of+israel&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=vZOieNvYF8&amp;sig=61-N9CbmZ4e5XsymZu3ypNZNPLc&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Djohn%2Bbright%2Bhistory%2Bof%2BIsrael%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPR12,M1 John Bright, ''A History of Israel'', 4th edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Bright did not believe that the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph could be regarded as reliable history, or that it was possible to reconstruct the origins of Israel from the biblical text alone, but he did believe that the stories in Genesis reflected the physical reality of the 20th–17th centuries BC, and that it was therefore possible to write a history of the origins of Israel by comparing the biblical accounts with what was known of the time from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/600320 G. W. Ahlstrom, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 95, No. 2 (Apr.&amp;nbsp;– Jun., 1975), review of John Bright's ''History of Israel'' (4th edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical archaeology today==
Albrightian theories were largely overturned in the second half of the 20th century, especially in regards to suppositions that Albrightians made regarding the pre-monarchic era. Improved archaeological methods, notably [[Kathleen Kenyon]]'s excavations at [[Jericho]], did not support the conclusions the biblical archaeologists had drawn, with the result that central theories squaring the biblical narrative with archaeological finds, such as Albright's reconstruction of Abraham as an [[Amorite]] donkey caravaneer, were rejected by the archaeological community. The challenge reached its climax with the publication of two important studies: In 1974 [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' re-examined the record of biblical archaeology in relation to the Patriarchal narratives in Genesis and concluded that "not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the Patriarchal narratives to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/545164 Thomas L. Thompson, "The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham", 1974, p.328, quoted in a review by Dennis Pardee, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1975 [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition (book)|''Abraham in History and Tradition'']]'' reached a similar conclusion about the usefulness of tradition history: "A vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a consensus approval of such arguments should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=101592134 |title=John Van Seters, ''Abraham in History and Tradition'', 1975, p.309 |access-date=2017-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605031648/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=101592134 |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time a new generation of archaeologists, notably [[William G. Dever]], criticized Biblical archaeology for failing to take note of the revolution in archaeology known as [[processual archaeology|processualism]], which saw the discipline as a scientific one allied to anthropology, rather than as a part of the corpus of the humanities linked to history and theology. Biblical archaeology, Dever said, remained "altogether too narrowly within a theological angle of vision,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/biblical_archaeology/archaeological_history_method.html Joel Ng, "Introduction to Biblical Archaeology", 2003 (revised 2004), at Edwardtbabinski.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and should be abandoned and replaced with a regional Syro-Palestinian archaeology operating within a processual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doncbenjamin.com/Archaeology_%26_the_Bible.pdf |title=Don C. Benjamin, "Stones &amp; Stories: an introduction to archaeology &amp; the Bible", 2008, p.16 |access-date=2018-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828065121/http://www.doncbenjamin.com/Archaeology_%26_the_Bible.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dever was broadly successful: most archaeologists working in the world of the Bible today do so within a processual or [[post-processual archaeology|post-processual]] framework: yet few describe themselves in these terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doncbenjamin.com/Archaeology_%26_the_Bible.pdf |title=Don C. Benjamin, "Stones &amp; Stories: an introduction to archaeology &amp; the Bible", 2008, p.7 |access-date=2018-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828065121/http://www.doncbenjamin.com/Archaeology_%26_the_Bible.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this attachment to the old nomenclature are complex, but are connected with the link between excavators (especially American ones) and the denominational institutions and benefactors who employ and support them, and with the unwillingness of biblical scholars, both conservative and liberal, to reject the link between the Bible and archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ziony Zevit]], [http://www.bsw.org/?l=71831&amp;a=Comm01.html "Three Debates About Bible and Archaeology: The 'Biblical Archaeology' Debate", ''[[Biblica (journal)|Biblica]]'' 83 (2002) pp.2–9]&lt;/ref&gt; The result has been a blurring of the distinction{{OR|date=October 2013}}{{failed verification|date=October 2013}}  between the theologically-based archaeology that interprets the archaeological record as "substantiating in general the theological message of a God who acts in history,"&lt;ref&gt;Specifically this was the view of Albright's student, G. E. Wright, and his "Biblical Theology" school, which became popular in America in the 1950s. See [http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/1619_3593.pdf Andrew G. Vaughn, review of William G. Dever, "What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archaeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel" (2001), RBL 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dever's vision of [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology]] as an "independent, secular discipline ... pursued by cultural historians for its own sake."&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, quoted in [[Ziony Zevit]], [http://shop.cwfa.org/cwfa/item.The-Future-of-Biblical-Archaeology-Reassessing-Methodologies.9780802821737.htm&amp;ct=Chapter_Excerpt "The Future of Biblical Archaeology: Reassessing Methodologies and Assumptions", 2001]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biofilm may also be considered a hydrogel, which is a complex polymer that contains many times its dry weight in water. Biofilms are not just bacterial slime layers but biological systems; the bacteria organize themselves into a coordinated functional community. Biofilms can attach to a surface such as a tooth, rock, or surface, and may include a single species or a diverse group of microorganisms. The biofilm bacteria can share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and a host body's immune system. A biofilm usually begins to form when a free-swimming bacterium attaches to a surface.&lt;ref&gt;

The formation of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first colonist bacteria of a biofilm may adhere to the surface initially by the weak [[van der Waals force]]s and hydrophobic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid11397632"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briandet R, Herry J, Bellon-Fontaine M | title = Determination of the van der Waals, electron donor and electron acceptor surface tension components of static Gram-positive microbial biofilms | journal = Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–310 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11397632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20438621"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi H, Suda T, Tanaka Y, Kimura B | title = Cellular hydrophobicity of Listeria monocytogenes involves initial attachment and biofilm formation on the surface of polyvinyl chloride | journal = Lett.

[[Hydrophobicity]] can also affect the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the substratum and the bacterium.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Donlan RM | year = 2002 | title = Biofilms: Microbial Life on Surfaces | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 881–890 | doi=10.3201/eid0809.020063 | pmid=12194761 | pmc=2732559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteria species are not able to attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. [[Non-motile bacteria]] cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt;

During surface colonization bacteria cells are able to communicate using [[quorum sensing]] (QS) products such as [[N-acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL). Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows by a combination of cell division and recruitment. [[Polysaccharide]] matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt; The final stage of biofilm formation is known as dispersion, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size.

The development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony (or colonies) to be increasingly [[antibiotic resistance|resistant to antibiotics]]. Cell-cell communication or [[quorum sensing]] has been shown to be involved in the formation of biofilm in several bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;Quorum-Sensing Regulation of the Biofilm Matrix Genes (pel) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal ==
[[File:Honors Option-MMG.svg|thumb|Biofilm Dispersal]]
Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|biofilm extracellular matrix]], such as [[dispersin B]] and [[deoxyribonuclease]], may contribute to biofilm dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Ramasubbu N, Fine DH |title=Detachment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells by an endogenous beta-hexosaminidase activity |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=185 |issue=16 |pages=4693–8 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896987 |pmc=166467 |doi=10.1128/JB.185.16.4693-4698.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Izano EA, Amarante MA, Kher WB, Kaplan JB |title=Differential roles of poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide and extracellular DNA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=470–6 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18039822 |pmc=2223269 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02073-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzymes that degrade the biofilm matrix may be useful as anti-biofilm agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Velliyagounder K, Fine DH, Ramasubbu N |title=Enzymatic detachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=2633–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15215120 |pmc=434209 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.7.2633-2636.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Xavier JB, Picioreanu C, Rani SA, van Loosdrecht MC, Stewart PS |title=Biofilm-control strategies based on enzymic disruption of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix--a modelling study |journal=Microbiology |volume=151 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3817–32 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16339929 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.28165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, [[Cis-2-Decenoic acid|''cis''-2-decenoic acid]], is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies.

It is generally assumed that cells dispersed from biofilms immediately go into the planktonic growth phase. However, recent studies have shown that the physiology of dispersed cells from ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' biofilms is highly different from those of planktonic and biofilm cells.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chua SL, Liu Y, Yam JK, Tolker-Nielsen T, Kjelleberg S, Givskov M, Yang L |title=Dispersed cells represent a distinct stage in the transition from bacterial biofilm to planktonic lifestyles |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |doi=10.1038/ncomms5462 |pmid=25042103 |pages=4462|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4462C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26158442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SL, Hultqvist LD, Yuan M, Rybtke M, Nielsen TE, Givskov M, Tolker-Nielsen T, Yang L | title = In vitro and in vivo generation and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-dispersed cells via c-di-GMP manipulation | journal = Nat Protoc | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 1165–80 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26158442 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2015.067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the dispersal process is a unique stage during the transition from biofilm to planktonic lifestyle in bacteria.

== Properties ==

Biofilms are usually found on solid [[wikt:substrate|substrates]] submerged in or exposed to an [[aqueous]] [[solution]], although they can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates. Given sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Biofilms can contain many different types of microorganism, e.g. [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[protozoa]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]]; each group performs specialized [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions. However, some organisms will form single-species films under certain conditions. The social structure (cooperation/competition) within a biofilm depends highly on the different species present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nadell|first=Carey D.|author2=Xavier, Joao B. |author3=Foster, Kevin R. |title=The sociobiology of biofilms |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |date=1 January 2009|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=206–224|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00150.x |pmid=19067751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extracellular matrix ===

The EPS matrix consists of [[exopolysaccharides]], proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danese|first=P. N.|last2=Pratt|first2=L.

This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as gene exchange. The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells. Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species (Wingender and Flemming, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 8, 623-633). Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute [[nutrient]]s and signalling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Paul|author2=Dirk deBeer |author3=Zbigniew Lewandowski |title=Liquid Flow in Biofilm Systems |journal=Appl.

Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlamakis|first=Hera|last2=Aguilar|first2=Claudio|last3=Losick|first3=Richard|last4=Kolter|first4=Roberto|date=2008-04-01|title=Control of cell fate by the formation of an architecturally complex bacterial community|journal=Genes &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=7|pages=945–953|doi=10.1101/gad.1645008|issn=0890-9369|pmc=2279205|pmid=18381896}}&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to [[detergent]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community.

However, biofilms are not always less susceptible to antibiotics. For instance, the biofilm form of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms may be due to the presence of [[persister cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Spoering AL, Lewis K |title=Biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have similar resistance to killing by antimicrobials |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |issue=23 |pages=6746–51 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11698361 |pmc=95513 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.23.6746-6751.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacteria mats near Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|Mats of bacterial biofilm color the hot springs in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The longest raised mat area is about half a meter long.]]

Biofilms are ubiquitous in organic life. Nearly every species of microorganism have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. Biofilms will form on virtually every non-shedding surface in [[Asepsis|non-sterile]] aqueous or humid environments. Biofilms can grow in the most extreme environments: from, for example, the extremely hot, briny waters of [[hot spring]]s ranging from very acidic to very alkaline, to frozen [[glacier]]s.

Biofilms can be found on rocks and pebbles at the bottoms of most streams or [[river]]s and often form on the surfaces of [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pools of water. Biofilms are important components of [[food chains]] in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic [[invertebrate]]s upon which many fish feed. Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, as in the case of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|title=Introduction to Biofilms: Desirable and undesirable impacts of biofilm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622002657/http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|archivedate=2008-06-22|df=}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, [[Pierce's Disease]] of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 2007|title=Influence of xylem fluid chemistry on planktonic growth, biofilm formation and aggregation of Xylella fastidiosa|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=274|issue=2|pages=210–7|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00827.x|pmid=17610515|vauthors=Andersen PC, Brodbeck BV, Oden S, Shriner A, Leite B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies in 2003 discovered that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly with the fact that the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support bio-film production and are associated with the bio-films developed in the gut. This is especially important because the appendix holds a mass amount of these bacterial bio-films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Barbas|first2=Andrew|last3=Bush|first3=Errol|last4=Lin|first4=Shu|last5=Parker|first5=William|date=24 June 2007|title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix|url=http://sciences.surgery.duke.edu/files/BillSection1SecondInsert.pdf|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=249|issue=4|pages=826–831|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032|pmid=17936308|last1=Bollinger|first1=Randal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of the appendix and the idea that the appendix can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora.

In the human environment, biofilms can grow in [[shower]]s very easily since they provide a moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and [[Sanitary sewer|sewage]] [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and cause clogging and [[corrosion]]. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause [[bioclogging]]. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/01457638108939572 |title=Influence of Fouling Biofilms on Heat Transfer |year=1981 |last1=Characklis |first1=WG |last2=Nevimons |first2=MJ |last3=Picologlou |first3=BF |journal=Heat Transfer Engineering |volume=3 |pages=23–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schwermer CU, Lavik G, Abed RM |title=Impact of nitrate on the structure and function of bacterial biofilm communities in pipelines used for injection of seawater into oil fields |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=2841–51 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18344353 |pmc=2394879 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02027-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that are attached to the metal subsurface (i.e., [[Microbial corrosion|microbially influenced corrosion]]).

Bacterial adhesion to boat hulls serves as the foundation for [[biofouling]] of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it is easier for other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships' hulls.

[[Stromatolites]] are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, especially of [[cyanobacteria]]. Stromatolites include some of the most ancient records of life on Earth, and are still forming today.

=== Dental plaque ===

Within the human body, biofilms are present on the [[teeth]] as [[dental plaque]], where they may cause [[tooth decay]] and [[gum disease]]. These biofilms can either be in an uncalcified state that can be removed by dental instruments, or a calcified state which is more difficult to remove. Removal techniques can also include [[antimicrobial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandki|first=Rita|last2=Banthia|first2=Priyank|last3=Banthia|first3=Ruchi|date=2011|title=Biofilms: A microbial home|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=111–114|doi=10.4103/0972-124X.84377|issn=0972-124X|pmc=3183659|pmid=21976832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dental plaque]] is an oral biofilm that adheres to the [[teeth]] and consists of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''Candida albicans''), embedded in salivary [[polymers]] and microbial extracellular products.

The dental plaque biofilm can result in the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from balanced populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an [[acidogenic]], aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary [[carbohydrate]]. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues ([[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and then [[dentin]]), the sign and symptom being a [[carious lesion]]. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathology of dental caries.

Competence can lead to genetic transformation, a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the competent cell and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when ''S. mutans'' cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown ''S. mutans'' cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than ''S. mutans'' growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

When the biofilm, containing ''S. mutans'' and related oral streptococci, is subjected to acid stress, the competence regulon is induced, leading to resistance to being killed by acid.&lt;ref name="Lemos" /&gt; As pointed out by Michod et al., transformation in bacterial pathogens likely provides for effective and efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages.&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2008|title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens|url=|journal=Infect.

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus''. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Izano EA, Gopal P |title=Low Levels of β-Lactam Antibiotics Induce Extracellular DNA Release and Biofilm Formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=MBio |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=2012 |doi=10.1128/mBio.00198-12|pmid=22851659 |pmc=3419523 |display-authors=etal |pages=e00198–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the [[tragedy of the commons]] in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com.eg/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;cluster=17231892830113723348&amp;btnI=1&amp;hl=ar] Ibrahim, Ahmed (2015): The tragedy of the commons and prisoner's dilemma may improve our realization of the theory of life and provide us with advanced therapeutic ways. figshare.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' ===

''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of septicemia in HIV-infected persons. When ''S. pneumonia'' grows in biofilms, genes are specifically expressed that respond to oxidative stress and induce competence.&lt;ref name="pmid16925554"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oggioni MR, Trappetti C, Kadioglu A, Cassone M, Iannelli F, Ricci S, Andrew PW, Pozzi G |title=Switch from planktonic to sessile life: a major event in pneumococcal pathogenesis |journal=Mol.

CSP also functions as a quorum-sensing peptide. It not only induces biofilm formation, but also increases virulence in pneumonia and meningitis.

It has been proposed that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of ''S. pneumoniae'' to survive the defenses of the host.&lt;ref name=Michod /&gt; In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22706053"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wei H, Håvarstein LS |title=Fratricide is essential for efficient gene transfer between pneumococci in biofilms |journal=Appl.

=== In industry ===
Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many [[sewage treatment]] plants include a [[secondary treatment]] stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]), while [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. [[Slow sand filter]]s rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate [[petroleum]] oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the [[microbial biodegradation|hydrocarbon-degrading]] activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCB).&lt;ref name="chapter9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|vauthors=Martins dos Santos VA, Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2|pages=1971|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx6v3TIkzXUC&amp;pg=PA1971#v=onepage|editor=Díaz E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New forms of cleaning procedures are being tested in order to reduce biofilm formation in these processes which will lead to safer and more productive food processing industries. These new forms of cleaning procedures also have a profound effect on the environment, often releasing toxic gases into the groundwater reservoirs.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

=== In aquaculture ===
[[File:Screen Shot 2017-12-13 at 1.40.19 PM.png|thumb|A bioflim from the [[Dead sea]]]]

In shellfish and algae farms, biofouling microbial species tend to block nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Marine biofouling on fish farms and its remediation|url=|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|volume=47|issue=|pages=215–252|author=Braithwaite R, McEvoy L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that are more favorable for biofouling species.

== Eukaryotic biofilms ==
{{See also|Phototrophic biofilms}}
Along with bacteria, biofilms are often initiated and produced by eukaryotic microbes. The biofilms produced by eukaryotes is usually occupied by bacteria and other eukaryotes alike, however the surface is cultivated and EPS is secreted initially by the eukaryote.&lt;ref name="pmid16897306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Colen 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cooksey K, Wigglesworth-Cooksey B | year = 1995 | title = Adhesion of bacteria and diatoms to surfaces in the sea: a review | url = | journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.3354/ame009087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[microalgae]] are known to form biofilms in such a way. Biofilms of fungal origin are important aspects of human infection and fungal pathagenicity, as the fungal infection is more resistant to antifungals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fanning S, Mitchell AP | year = 2012 | title = Fungal Biofilms | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = e1002585 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11514524"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra J, Kuhn DM, Mukherjee PK, Hoyer LL, McCormick T, Ghannoum MA | title = Biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans: development, architecture, and drug resistance | journal = J.

In the environment, fungal biofilms are an area of ongoing research. One key area of research is fungal biofilms on plants. For example, in the soil, plant associated fungi including [[mycorrhiza]] have been shown to decompose organic matter, protect plants from bacterial pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications {{cite book|last1=Burmølle|first1=Mette|last2=Kjøller|first2=Annelise|last3=Sørenses|first3=Søren|editor1-last=Lear|editor1-first=Gavin|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Gillian|title=Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications|date=2012|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|isbn=1904455964|pages=61–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by [[diatom]]s. The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress.&lt;ref name="pmid27009999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25268215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele DJ, Franklin DJ, Underwood GJ | title = Protection of cells from salinity stress by extracellular polymeric substances in diatom biofilms | journal = Biofouling | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 987–98 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25268215 | pmc = 4706044 | doi = 10.1080/08927014.2014.960859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the [[phycosphere]], but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as it has been shown that although diatoms excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.&lt;ref name="pmid26986529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Windler M, Leinweber K, Bartulos CR, Philipp B, Kroth PG | title = Biofilm and capsule formation of the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum are affected by a bacterium | journal = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">In video technology, '''blanking level''' is the level of the [[composite video signal]] during the front and back porches of the video signal.

The composite video signal is actually the video information superimposed on blanking. The total level of the composite video signal (blanking + video) is 1000 mV.  This level can also be given in [[IRE (unit)|IRE]] units such that the level difference reserved for video information is 100 IRE units. So white corresponds to 100 IRE units and blanking level corresponds to 0 IRE units. The level of black is 0 IRE units in the case of [[CCIR System B]] and [[CCIR System G]] (European systems) and 7.5 IRE units in the case of [[CCIR System M]] (American system).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolumbus.fi/pami1/video/pal_ntsc.html Kolumbus page]&lt;/ref&gt; So, while there is no difference between the black and the blanking levels in most systems they differ by 50 mV. in system M. (When defined in terms of voltage difference, 7.5 IRE units is almost equal to 50 mV.)

'''Cabinets of curiosities''' (also known in [[German language|German]] loanwords as '''Kunstkabinett''', '''Kunstkammer''' or '''Wunderkammer'''; also '''Cabinets of Wonder''', and '''wonder-rooms''') were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to [[natural history]] (sometimes faked), [[geology]], [[ethnography]], [[archaeology]], religious or historical [[relic]]s, works of art (including  [[cabinet painting]]s), and [[antiquities]]. "The Kunstkammer was regarded as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''51'''.1  (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Charles I of England]]'s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, "The ''Kunstkabinett'' itself was a form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism", A.G. Dickens, ed. ''The Courts of Europe'' (London) 1977:201.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of [[science]] in [[Europe]] formed collections that were precursors to [[museum]]s.

The term ''[[Cabinet (architecture)|cabinet]]'' originally described a room rather than a [[Cabinet (furniture)|piece of furniture]]. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the [[Hradschin]] at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation&lt;ref&gt;This is the secretive aspect emphasised by R.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;W. Evans, ''Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History'' (Oxford) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, "Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio",&lt;!--Representatio is correct--&gt; ''Art Journal'' '''38'''.1 (Autumn 1978:22–28).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf's uncle, [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II, Archduke of Austria]], also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities]] at [[Ambras Castle]] in Austria.

[[Image:RitrattoMuseoFerranteImperato.jpg|thumb|left|Fold-out engraving from [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet]]
[[Image:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|A corner of a cabinet, painted by [[Frans II Francken]] in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era ''[[virtuoso]]'' might evince]]
The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599) (''illustration, left''). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his [[herbarium]]. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a ''studiolo''&lt;ref&gt;''Studiolo'': the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with [[intarsia]] that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in ''trompe-l'oeil'' perspective. The Gubbio ''studiolo'' has been reassembled at the [[Metropolitan Museum]]; the Urbino ''studiolo'' remains in situ.&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of [[Florence]] and [[Antwerp]] were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand.&lt;/ref&gt; Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.

In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised [[Christian&amp;nbsp;I of Saxony]] that three types of item were indispensable in forming a "Kunstkammer" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals".&lt;ref&gt;B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, "How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed", ''Journal of the History of Collections'', 1989 Vol I: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Albrecht Dürer]] visited the [[Netherlands]] in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to [[Nuremberg]] various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly characteristic range of interests represented in  [[Frans II Francken]]'s painting of 1636 (''illustration, left'') shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'') intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely [[amber]], which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing ''Libera'', a Roman fertility goddess)&lt;ref&gt;Her base is inscribed LIBER[A]&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand and modern and religious (''Christ at the Column''&lt;ref&gt;It appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by [[Alessandro Algardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): [[portrait miniature]]s, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro woodcuts]] or drawings, and a small [[still-life]] painting&lt;ref&gt;Still life was considered a [[hierarchy of genres|lesser genre]] than even portraits or landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt; leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of [[Ole Worm]], known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (''illustration, above right''), and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork [[automaton|automata]]; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently [[mythology|mythical]] creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Scythian Lamb]], a woolly [[fern]] thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the [[narwhal]]'s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a [[unicorn]], as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.

In the second half of the 18th century, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (c. 1735–1815) operated in [[Ljubljana]], then the capital of [[Carniola]], a natural history cabinet ({{lang-de|Naturalienkabinet}}) that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Russian grand duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Pope Pius VI]], as well as by famous naturalists, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Griselini|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Benedikt Hermann|de|3=Franz Benedikt Hermann (Geologe)}}. It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the [[Idrija mercury mine|Idrija mine]], a ''[[herbarium vivum]]'' with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an [[anatomical theatre]].&lt;ref name=Jezernik&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-IARZL5AU |title=Ljubljanske »knjige sveta« od Auerspergov do Hacqueta |first=Božidar |last=Jezernik |year=2009 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Ljubljana's "Books of the World" – from the Auerspergs to Hacquet |journal=Etnolog |id={{COBISS|ID=1242502}} |volume=19=70 |pages=23–33 |issn=0354-0316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the ''Museum Wormianum'' (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many [[monarch]]s, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the [[Studiolo of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III of Denmark]], who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the [[Kunstkamera]] founded by [[Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from [[Albertus Seba]] and [[Frederik Ruysch]]. The fabulous [[Habsburg]] Imperial collection included important [[Aztec]] artifacts, including the [[Montezuma's headdress|feather head-dress]] or crown of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] now in the [[Vienna Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]]. 
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum Korallen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An early eighteenth-century German  ''Schrank'' with a traditional display of [[coral]]s (Naturkundenmuseum Berlin)]]

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex ''Kunstschränke'' produced in the early seventeenth century by the [[Augsburg]] merchant, diplomat and collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632, which is kept in the [[Gustavianum|Museum Gustavianum]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[curio cabinet]], as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the [[Grünes Gewölbe]], the "Green Vaults" formed by [[Augustus the Strong]] in [[Dresden]] to display his chamber of wonders.  The "Enlightenment Gallery" in the [[British Museum]], installed in the former "Kings Library" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_1_enlightenment.aspx |title=Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a ''cabinet'' came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of ''[[virtù]]'' or curiosities, such as a ''[[virtuoso]]'' would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, [[Michael Bernhard Valentini]] published an early [[Museology|museological]] work, ''Museum Museorum'', an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial [[freak show]]s and [[sideshows]].

[[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the founder of the [[British Museum]] in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the [[Duke of Albemarle]] offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, ''Natural History of Jamaica'', published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P.

" Sir Hans Sloane and Abbé Jean Paul Bignon: Notes on Collection Building in the Eighteenth Century," in ''The Library Quarterly'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (October 1980), 475–482; de Beer, G.&amp;nbsp;R.

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. [[Herman Boerhaave]] gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased [[Leonard Plukenet]]'s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)]], left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and [[James Petiver]]'s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. [[Mark Catesby]] gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. [[Philip Miller]] gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; de Beer, G. R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; Gray, Basil. "Sloane and the Kaempfer Collection," in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 20–23; and "The Sloane Collection of Manuscripts" in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain [[James Cook]] in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.

[[John Tradescant the elder]] (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, [[John Tradescant the younger]] (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[dodo]] from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr"&gt;Ivins, Jr., William M. "The Tradescant Collection", in ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194–197; Josten, C.H. ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692): His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, His Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to His Life and Work: Texts, 1661–1672'', (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967); Leith-Ross, Prudence.

''Strange Blooms: The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants'', (London: Atlantic, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, [[Freemason]], and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of ''Musaeum Tradescantianum'', a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the [[University of Oxford]], provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole’s donation formed the foundation of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr" /&gt;

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at [[Snowshill Manor]] and [[Wallington Hall]]. The concept has been reinterpreted at [[The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A two-headed lamb and ancient dildos: the UK's strangest new museum|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/two-headed-lamb-ancient-dildos-uks-strangest-new-museum|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Oliver|last = Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social function====
[[File:17th-Century Cabinet of Curiosities.jpg|thumb|left|Italian Baroque-era cabinet of curiosities, circa 1635.]]
Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be "the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic," or the less grandiose, "the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes." Evans goes on to explain that "no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impey, MacGregor|first1=Oliver, Arthur|title=The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/detail.action?docID=10677039&amp;p00=cabinet+curiosities|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the [[English Civil War]] and Interregum [sic].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/reader.action?docID=10677039|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.”&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;” an idea supported by [[John Evelyn]], who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;”

Thomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the [[American College of Physicians]] in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The [[Mütter Museum]] began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including [[Benjamin Rush]]'s medical chest and [[Florence Nightingale]]'s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the Siamese twins; and in 1893, [[Grover Cleveland]]'s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022221/http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundieart.com/cabinet/ |title=James G.

[[P.&amp;nbsp;T. Barnum]] took over [[Barnum's American Museum]] on five floors in New York, "perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, "THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!" at the exit door".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324407504578185622576715416?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture "Catalog of Curiosities"] by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal.

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the [[Hobby Club]], a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their "cabinets of wonder" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and [[incunable]]; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.&lt;ref&gt;According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912–1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
[[Image:My Cabinet o'Curiosities1.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Modern interpretation of a Wunderkammer]]

The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the modern-day [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.&lt;ref&gt;The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: ''Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as [[House on the Rock]], can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[Musée Patamécanique]] is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by [['Pataphysics|Pataphysics]]. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderkammern.net// Wunderkammern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325091444/http://www.wunderkammern.net/ |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how "amazement" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called "Wunder Kammer", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918075929/http://www.wunder-kammer.com/ wunder-kamer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as [[YouTube]] as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions "just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert W.|title=Youtube As Archive: Who Will Curate This Digital Wunderkammer?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|year=2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1177/1367877908098854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caroline King-Okumu''' (formerly Caroline King) is a senior researcher for the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED).  Her major areas of research are [[Drylands|dryland ecosystems]], economic and [[environmental assessment]], and [[climate change]].  She is considered an international expert on land and water management, particularly drylands agriculture.&lt;ref name="Daley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bose|first1=Purabi|title=Action Plan for Drylands Dialogue and Social Diversity|url=https://ciat.cgiar.org/dapa-2/action-plan-for-drylands-dialogue-and-social-diversity|website=CIAT: International Center for Tropical Agriculture|date=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; King-Okumu is based in [[Kenya]]&lt;ref name="Nexus"/&gt; but is involved in research and projects throughout the world.

==Career==
King-Okumu has worked with the [[United Nations University]] (UNU),&lt;ref name="Daley"/&gt; [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD),&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt; and [[International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas]] (ICARDA).&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICARDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Caroline|title=Water &amp;  Livelihoods Initiative|url=http://www.icarda.org/wli/pdfs/FirthRegionalCoordinationMeeting/Introduction_WLIRegionalAgenda_11_05.pdf|website=ICARDA|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has consulted with the Ecosystems and Human Development Association (EHDA)&lt;ref name="Jaafar"/&gt; and has been a Visiting Research Associate at the School of Geography and Environment at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Jaafar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster-Wallace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuster-Wallace|first1=Corinne J.|last2=Grover|first2=Velma I.|last3=Adeel|first3=Zafar|last4=Confalonieri|first4=Ulisses|last5=Elliott|first5=Susan|title=Safe Water as the Key to Global Health|url=http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SafeWater_Web_version.pdf|publisher=United Nations University|date=2008|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently she is a senior researcher in the Climate Change Group of the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED)&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toulmin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toulmin|first1=Camilla|last2=Hesse|first2=Ced|last3=Tari|first3=Daoud|last4=King–Okumu|first4=Caroline|title=Investing in institutional ‘software’ to build climate resilience|url=http://www.aglobalvillage.org/journal/online/iied/|website=A Global Village|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[London, England]]. IIED is an international organization engaged in policy and action research to support sustainable local development in countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Pacific]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iied.org/about|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King-Okumu studies methods for the sustainable integrated management of water and land in dryland ecosystems, and economic and environmental assessment techniques for calculating the costs of groundwater degradation. She encourages initiatives for decision-making in the context of longer-term considerations of increasing variability and climate change.  She works to develop in-country partnerships engaging government, research institutions, civic groups and the private sector, to support sustainable practices and community-based adaptation and to increase climate change resilience.&lt;ref name="IIED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline King-Okumu|url=http://www.iied.org/users/caroline-king-okumu|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner"/&gt;

King-Okumu analyzes situations in terms of a nexus of interlinked water, energy, and food production concerns rather than focusing solely on water balance and food production.&lt;ref name="Jaafar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Caroline|last2=Jaafar|first2=Hadi|title=Rapid assessment of the water–energy–food–climate nexus in six selected basins of North Africa and West Asia undergoing transitions and scarcity threats|journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development|date=22 April 2015|volume=31|issue=3|pages=343–359|doi=10.1080/07900627.2015.1026436|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07900627.2015.1026436?src=recsys|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Conceptual physics''' is an approach to teaching [[physics]] that focuses on the ideas of physics rather than the often daunting mathematics. It is believed that with a strong [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] foundation in physics, students are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and to make connections between the concepts of physics and their everyday life. Early versions used almost no equations or math-based problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewett |first=Paul G. |title=Conceptual Physics |edition=5th |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1985 |isbn=0-316-35974-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul G. Hewitt]] popularized this approach with his textbook ''Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment|publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review at the time, Kenneth Ford noted the emphasis on logical reasoning and said "Hewitt's excellent book can be called physics without equations, or physics without computation, but not physics without mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Kenneth W.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to Your Environment|journal=Physics Today|date=October 1971|volume=24|issue=10|pages=54–55|doi=10.1063/1.3022390|bibcode = 1971PhT....24j..54H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt's wasn't the first book to take this approach. ''Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion'' by Jae R. Ballif and William E. Dibble was published in 1969.&lt;ref name="BallifDibble1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballif|first1=Jae R.|author2=William E. Dibble|title=Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zq7vAAAAMAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Hewitt's book became very successful. As of 2014 it is in its twelfth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewett|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics|year=2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-90910-7|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Hewitt wrote a version for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: The High School Physics Program|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-133-64749-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of the conceptual approach to teaching physics broadened the range of students taking physics in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hehn|first=Jack|author2=Michael Neuschatz|title=Physics For All? A Million and Counting!|journal=Physics Today|volume=59|issue=2|date=February 2006|pages=37–43|doi=10.1063/1.2186280|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/million.pdf|bibcode = 2006PhT....59b..37H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollment in conceptual physics courses in high school grew from 25,000 students in 1987 to over 400,000 in 2009. In 2009, 37% of students took high school physics, and 31% of them were in Physics First, conceptual physics courses, or regular physics courses using a conceptual textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Susan|author2=Casey Langer Tesfaye|title=High School Physics Courses and Enrollments|journal=Focus On|date=August 2010|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/highschool3.pdf|publisher=American Institute of Physics Statistical Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to teaching physics has also inspired books for science literacy courses, such as ''From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness'' by Sadri Hassani.&lt;ref name="Hassani2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassani|first=Sadri|title=From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oypZ_a9pqdsC|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0849-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|1=CRID redirects here. CRID may also refer to a current rail indicator device, a safety device indicating the presence of [[third rail]] power, or to a [[Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector|Cherenkov Ring-Imaging Detector]]}}

== Overview ==
A '''content reference identifier''' or '''CRID''' is a concept from the standardization work done by the [[TV-Anytime]] forum. It is or closely matches the concept of the [[Uniform Resource Locator]], or URL, as used on the [[World-Wide Web]]:

{{Quotation|A unit of content, in a [[Broadcasting|broadcast stream]], can be referred to by its globally unique CRID in the same way that a [[webpage]] can be referred to by its globally unique URL on the web.}}&lt;!--source? or is it not a quotation?--&gt;

The concept of CRID permits to reference contents unambiguously, regardless of their location, i.e., without knowing specific broadcast information (time, date and channel) or how to obtain them through a network, for instance, by means of a streaming service or by downloading a file from an Internet server.

The receiver must be capable of resolving these unambiguous references, i.e., translate them into specific data that will allow it to obtain the location of that content in order to acquire it. This makes it possible for recording processes to take place without knowing that information, and even without knowing beforehand the duration of the content to be recorded: a complete series by a simple click, a program that has not been scheduled yet, a set of programs grouped by a specific criterion…

This framework allows for the separation between the reference to a given content (the CRID) and the necessary information to acquire it, which is called a “locator”. Each CRID may lead to one or more locators which will represent different copies of the same content. They may be identical copies broadcast in different channels or dates, or cost different prices. They may also be distinct copies with different technical parameters such as format or quality.

It may also be the case that the resolution process of a CRID provides another CRID as a result (for example, its reference in a different network, where it has an alternative identifier assigned by a different operator) or a set of CRIDs (for instance, if the original CRID represents a TV series, in which case the resolution process would result in the list of CRIDs representing each episode).
 
From the above it can be concluded that provided that a given content can belong to many groups (each possibly defined by distinctive qualities), it is possible that many CRIDs carry the same content. That is, several CRIDs may be resolved into the same locator.

A CRID is not exactly a universal, unique and exclusive identifier for a given content. It is closely related to the authority that creates it, to the resolution service provider, and to the content provider in such a way that the same content may have different CRIDs depending on the field in which they are used (for example, a different one for each television operator that has the rights to broadcast the content).

== Format ==
A CRID is specified much like URLs. In fact, a CRID is a so-called [[uniform resource identifier|URI]]. Typically, the content creator, the broadcaster or a third party will use their [[domain name system|DNS]]-names in a combination with a product-specific name to create globally unique CRIDs. That is, the syntax of a CRID is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 crid://authority/data
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The ''authority'' field represents the entity that created the CRID and its format is that of a DNS name. The ''data'' field represents a string of characters that will unambiguously identify the content within the authority scope (it is a string of characters assigned by the authority itself).

As an example, let's assume that [[BBC]] wanted to make a CRID for (all the programs of) the Olympics in China. It may have looked something like this
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 crid://bbc.co.uk/olympics/2008/
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This would be a group CRID, that is, a CRID representing a group of contents. Then, to refer to a specific event – such as the women's shot-put final – they could have used the following inside their metadata.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 crid://bbc.co.uk/olympics/2008/final/shotput/women
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Currently,{{When|date=January 2013}} four types of CRIDs are playing a major role in some [[Unidirectional networks|unidirectional]] television networks: programme CRID, series CRID, group CRID, and recommendation CRID. One of the most important applications of CRIDs is the so-called series link recording function (SL) of modern digital video recorders ([[Digital video recorder|DVR]], [[Personal video recorder|PVR]]).

In turn, a locator is a string of characters that contains all the necessary information for a receiver to find and acquire a given content, whether it is received through a transport stream, located in local storage, downloaded as a file from an Internet server, or through a streaming service. For example, a DVB locator will include all the necessary parameters to identify a specific content within a transport stream: network, transport stream, service, table and/or event identifiers.

The locators' format, as established in TV-Anytime, is quite generic and simple, and corresponds to:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 [transport-mechanism]:[specific-data]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first part of the locator’s format (the transport mechanism) must be a string of characters that is unique for each mechanism (transport stream, local file, HTTP Internet access…). The second part must be unambiguous only within the scope of a given transport mechanism and will be standardized by the organism in charge of the regulation of the mechanism itself. 
For instance, a DVB locator to identify a content within the transport stream of networks that follow this standard would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 dvb://112.4a2.5ec;2d22~20121212T220000Z—PT01H30M
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which would indicate a content (identified by the string “2d22”) that airs on a channel available on a DVB network identified by the address “112.4a2.5ec” (network “112”, transport stream “4a2” and service “5ec”), on 12 December 2012 at 10 p.m. and with a duration of 90 minutes.

== The location resolution process ==

The location resolution process is the procedure by which, starting from the CRID of a given content, one or several locators of that content are obtained. Resolving a CRID can be a direct process, which leads immediately to one or many locators, or it may also happen that in the first place one or many intermediate CRIDs are returned, which must undergo the same procedure to finally obtain one or several locators.

This procedure involves some information elements, among which we find two structures named resolving authority record (RAR) and ContentReferencingTable, respectively. Consulting them repeatedly will take the receiver from a CRID to one or many locators that will allow it to acquire the content.

'''The RAR table'''

The RAR table is one or many data structures that provide the receiver, for each authority that submits CRIDs, information on the corresponding resolution service provider. Among other things, it informs about which mechanism is used to provide information to resolve the CRIDs from each authority. That is, one or many RAR records must exist for each authority that indicate the receiver where it has to go to resolve the CRIDs of that particular authority.

For example, in the record of the figure (expressed by means of a XML structure, according to the XML Schema defined in the TV-Anytime) there is an authority called “tve.es”, whose resolution service provider is the entity “rtve.es”, available on the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;"http://tva.rtve.es/locres/tve"&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which means there is resolution information in that URL.

[[File:RAR record example.png|center|RAR table in XML format]]

These RAR records will have reached the receiver in an indefinite form, unimportant for the TV-Anytime specification, which will depend on the specific transport mechanism of the network to which the receiver is connected. Each family of standards that regulates distribution networks (DVB, ATSC, ISDB, IPTV...) will have previously defined such procedure, which will be used by devices certified according to those standards.

'''The ContentReferencingTable table'''

The second structure involved in the location resolution process is a proper resolution table which, given a content's CRID, returns one or several locators that enable the receiver to access an instance of that content, or one or many CRIDs that allow it to move forward in the resolution process.

The figure shows an example of this second structure, an XML document according to the specifications of the XML Schema defined in TV-Anytime. In it, several sections are included (&lt;Result&gt; elements) that structure the information that describes each resolution case.

[[File:ContentReferencingTable.png|center|an example of a ContentReferencingTable]]

The first one declares how a CRID (crid://tv.com/Friends/all), which corresponds to a group content that encompasses several episodes (two) of the “Friends” series is resolved. The result of the resolution process provides two new CRIDs each of them corresponding to one of the two episodes.

The second &lt;Result&gt; element resolves the CRID of the first episode of the first season. The result of the resolution process is two DVB locators. The “acquire” attribute with “any” value indicates that any of them are good (the second one is a repetition broadcast a week later).

The third &lt;Result&gt; element gives information about the second episode. It indicates that it cannot be resolved yet (“status” attribute with the “cannot yet resolve” value), indicating a date on which the request for resolution information must be repeated.

'''The process'''

Once the user has selected a given content (identified by the corresponding CRID) to perform some action upon it, the receiver begins the location resolution process that shall lead to specific location information that allows access to a copy of the content.

This procedure depends mainly on the receiver’s connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between unidirectional networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and bidirectional networks, where there is also a return channel through which the receiver can communicate with the outside (typically an Internet access).

For receivers connected only to a broadcast channel, it is clear that the resolution information must come directly from that channel, or be available somehow in an existing local storage system. After selecting a CRID, the first thing the receiver needs to do is check the information about where to find the resolution table. For this, it must find a RAR record associated with the authority of the selected CRID.

Once a RAR record corresponding to that authority is found, the receiver will know, by referring to the URL field, where to access (or, in this case, where to listen) to obtain the resolution information.

The information that will receive through that access point will consist of a message for each of the consulted CRIDs (for example, a &lt;Result&gt; element in the ContentReferencingTable).

== In web casting ==
To make the CRID even more globally available the [[IETF]] will publish a request for comments specifying the use of the CRID over the web. This will allow consumer devices to hook up to content provider servers, much like current browsers look up webservers, requesting content by CRID.

In May 2005, an Informational RFC, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4078 No 4078], was published as the start of this work.

The long-term goal is that CRIDs should be available for use by [[cell phones]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[Digital television|digital TV]] [[Set-top box|receivers]] and other [[Consumer electronics|consumer devices]] for fetching content, either from a broadcast stream or over [[internet protocol|IP]]-based [[computer network|networks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="972">'''Cryogenic engineering''' is a sub stream of [[mechanical engineering]] dealing with [[cryogenics]], and related very low temperature processes such as [[Liquid air|air liquefaction]], [[cryogenic engine]]s (for rocket propulsion), [[cryosurgery]]. Generally, temperatures below cold come under the preview of cryogenic engineering.
Cryogenics may be considered as the recent advancement in the field of [[refrigeration]]. Though there is no fixed demarcation as to where refrigeration ends and cryogenics begins even then for general reference temperature below –150c(120k) are considered as cryogenic temperature. The four gases which mainly contribute for cryogenic application and research are (O2-B.P.90K), (N2-B.P.77K), (Helium-B.P.4.2k) &amp; (H2-B.P.20K).
The word "cryogenic" is derived from Greek κρύο (cryo) – "cold" + γονική (genic) – "having to do with production".

'''''Dastūr al-Mulūk''''' ({{lang-fa|دستور الملوک}})&lt;ref&gt;Variants: ''Dastur al-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ol-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ul-Muluk'', ''Dastūr-ul-Mulūk''.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of only three surviving [[administrative handbook]]s from early 18th-century [[Safavid]] [[Iran]] and an important research tool for scholars in [[Iranology]]. The Persian manuscript was edited during the 1960s by the Iranian scholar [[Mohammad Taqi Danesh Pajouh]].

A Russian translation by Dr Vil'danova appeared in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], in the 1990s. In 2002, an annotated English translation ({{ISBN|983-9379-26-7}}), which contains also a facsimile of what was then thought among scholars to be the complete manuscript, was published and translated into English for the first time by the German scholar [[:de:Christoph Marcinkowski|Christoph Marcinkowski]], based on his dissertation. 

Already in 2000, this dissertation was awarded by then Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] the First Prize for Best Research on Iranian Culture Award for the Year 2000 (International Category) by the Iranian Ministry of Culture. A Persian translation of Marcinkowski's 2002 study by Ali Kordabadi and Mansur Sefatgol appeared in 1385 AH solar (2006 CE) in Tehran at Markaz-e Asnad va Tarikh-e Diplomasi (published by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs). 

Subsequently, the Iranian scholar [[Iraj Afshar]] discovered and edited the remainder of the manuscript. This part, too, was translated into English and discussed by Dr. Marcinkowski in the ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'', the journal of the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] (see below).

==Biography==
Price was born in [[Leyton]], [[England]], to Philip Price, a [[tailor]], and Fanny de Solla, a singer. He began work in 1938 as an assistant in a physics laboratory at the [[Waltham Forest College|South West Essex Technical College]], before studying [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] at the [[University of London]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1942. He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[experimental physics]] from the [[University of London]] in 1946.

In 1948 Price worked as a teacher of applied mathematics at Raffles College, which was to become part of the [[National University of Singapore]]. It was there that he formulated his theory on the exponential growth of science, an idea that occurred to him when he noticed the characteristic logarithmic curve of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' between 1665 and 1850, which he had stacked against his wall at home while Raffles College had its library built.

After three years, Price returned to England to work on a second Ph.D., in the [[history of science]], this time at the [[University of Cambridge]]. During his Ph.D. studies, he accidentally discovered ''Equatorie of the Planetis'', a [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] manuscript in [[Cambridge University Library]], written in [[Middle English]], which he attributed to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. It is now attributed to a [[St Albans]] monk called John Westwyk.

Around 1950, Price adopted his mother's [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] name, "de Solla", as a middle name. He was a "British [[Atheism|Atheist]]&amp;nbsp;... from a rather well-known Sephardic Jewish family", and although his [[Denmark|Danish]] wife, Ellen, had been christened as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], he did not, according to their son [[Mark de Solla Price|Mark]], regard their marriage as "mixed", because they were both atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.markandvinny.com/Mark_de_Solla_Price_UU_Sermon_Gay_Pride_2007.pdf | title=Mark de Solla Price UU Sermon Gay Pride 2007 | last=Price | first=Mark de Solla | date=2007-06-17 | access-date=2008-08-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his second doctorate, Price moved to the [[United States]], where he served as a consultant to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and as a fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. His next post was at [[Yale University]], where he worked until his death, serving as the Avalon Professor of the History of Science, and as chair of a new department that encompassed the histories of science, technology, and medicine.

In 1984, Price received, posthumously, the [[Association for Information Science and Technology|ASIS Research Award]] for outstanding contributions in the field of information science.

==Scientific contributions==
Price's major scientific contributions include:
* '''Price's square root law''' or '''Price's law''' pertains to the relationship between the literature on a subject and the number of authors in the subject area, stating that half of the publications come from the square root of all contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222619181_Price%27s_square_root_law_Empirical_validity_and_relation_to_Lotka%27s_law| author=Travis Nicholls, Paul| title= Price's square root law: Empirical validity and relation to Lotka's law. |publisher=ResearchGate |doi= 10.1016/0306-4573(88)90049-0 |date=December 1988 |access-date= September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if 100 papers are written by 25 authors, five authors will have contributed 50 papers. Price's law is related to [[Lotka's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allison |first1=Paul D. |last2=Price |first2=Derek de Solla |last3=Griffith |first3=Belver C. |last4=Moravcsik |first4=Michael J. |last5=Stewart |first5=John A. |title=Lotka's Law: A Problem in Its Interpretation and Application |journal=Social Studies of Science |date=1976 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=269–276 |jstor=284934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Studies of the exponential growth of science and the half-life of scientific literature;
* Quantitative studies of the network of citations between scientific papers (Price 1965), including the discovery that both the in- and out-degrees of a citation network have power-law distributions, making this the first published example of a [[scale-free network]];
* '''[[Price's model]]''', a mathematical theory of the growth of citation networks, based on what would now be called a [[preferential attachment]] process (Price 1976);&lt;ref&gt;The technical elements of Price's treatment relied heavily upon previous work by [[Herbert A. Simon]], but Price was the first to apply the idea to the growth of a network.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''design director''' is a position usually found within the [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], [[automotive]] or [[entertainment industry|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well. The position has similarities to that of a [[creative director]]. The design director oversees the design of [[brand]]ing and advertising for a client, ensuring that the new branding and advertising fits in with the client's requirements and the image they wish to promote for their company or product. However, unlike a creative director, the design director is not responsible for the overall quality of the final creative work, but merely for the quality of the project's design elements.

Another distinction between the two positions is that advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copywriting or art directing positions. Design directors, on the other hand, are promoted from [[senior designer]] positions.

{{Discrimination sidebar|expanded=Social}}

'''Elitism''' is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an [[elite]] — a select group of people with a certain [[ancestry]], intrinsic [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], high [[intellect]], [[wealth]], special skills, or experience — are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. In the United States, the term ''elitism'' often refers to the concentration of power in the [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast Corridor]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where the typical American elite resides – journalists, lawyers, doctors, high-level civil servants, businesspeople, university lecturers, entrepreneurs, and financial advisors in the [[quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary sector]], often in established technological or political catchments of their [[higher education]] [[alma mater]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Alternatively, the term ''elitism'' may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include [[anti-elitism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[populism]] and [[political theory]] of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].

[[Elite theory]] is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal. Elitism is closely related to [[social class]] and what [[sociologist]]s call [[social stratification]], which in the [[Anglo Saxon]] tradition have long been anchored in the "blue blood" claims of hereditary [[nobility]]. Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite. The term ''elitism'' is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an [[in-group]] or [[En cadre|cadre]] grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as ''[[discrimination]]''.

==Characteristics==
Attributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elitist status ''can'' be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, it can (in archaic societies) be based on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents. As a term, "elite" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or wisdom within a given field. Elitists tend to favor social systems such as [[meritocracy]], [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and [[plutocracy]] as opposed to radical [[democracy]], political [[egalitarianism]] and [[populism]]. Elitists also believe only a few "shakers and movers" truly change society rather than society being changed by the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power. To elitists, the public is abjectly powerless and can be manipulated only by the top group of elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elite (elitist) theory|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/elite_theory|website=auburn.edu|publisher=Auburn University|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[synonym]]s for "elite" might be "upper-class" or "[[aristocracy|aristocratic]]", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's [[means of production]]. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative "class" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.

===Academic elitism===
{{anchor|Academic}}
{{see also|Ivory tower}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Elitism in the context of [[education]] is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those [[student]]s who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an "elite" school can also mean a school for the wealthy or one that is hard to enter.

==Anti-elitism&lt;!--'Antielitism' and 'Antielitism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{main|Populism|Pluralism (political theory)}}
The term ''elitism'' and the [[pejorative]] title ''elitist'' are sometimes used by people who are not (or, who claim not to be) members of elite organizations. In politics, such terms are often used to disparage a politician's views as out of touch with the interests of the "[[average Joe]]". The implication is that the alleged elitist person or group thinks they are better than everyone else, and put themselves before others as a result. The definition of ''elitist'' is similar to that of the word "[[snob]]".

An elitist is not always seen as truly elite, but only privileged. The definition may have different appreciations depending on the political contexts. Since elitism may be viewed as something necessary for creating patterns of good intellectual or professional performance, it can be used also for maintaining conditions of lack of competition and privilege.

An early proponent of '''anti-elitism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley, ''Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology'', Routledge, 2010, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarianism===
{{further|Egalitarianism}}
Elitism endorses the exclusion of large numbers of people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, [[populism]], [[socialism]], or [[communism]]. They may also support [[affirmative action]], [[social security]], [[luxury tax]]es, and highly [[progressive tax]]es for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti-[[meritocracy|meritocratic]] in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.

The terms ''elitism'' and ''meritocracy'' are not equivalent in meaning. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|date=January 2008|volume=29|issue=7–27|pages=7|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flat Eric''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[puppet]] character created by [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]] from [[Levi's]] [[Television advertisement|commercials]] for [[Sta-Prest]] One Crease Denim Clothing, built by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/299803.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Flat Eric's cruise to the top |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-03-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name comes from an idea for a commercial that included having a car run over his head and flattening it. The idea was not used, but the name stuck. In the commercials, Flat Eric would ride with his friend Angel (played by Philippe Petit) around California, evading the police as a wanted criminal.&lt;ref name="guardian1608"&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyne Ellis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/aug/16/mondaymediasection1 |title=Eric exposed &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2000-08-29|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Flat Eric was based on a puppet called Stéphane that was similar, but with ears and the hands were fixed.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utalkmarketing.com/pages/Article.aspx?ArticleID=15018 |title=Advertising icon Flat Eric to be resurrected - Marketing News |publisher=UTalkMarketing |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stéphane appeared in some short films by Mr. Oizo (including a video for the track [[M-Seq]]), and had a small cult following in the United Kingdom and France.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt; In 1999, Levi's decided to build a television commercial campaign around the puppet, to be directed by Oizo. The character was renamed Eric, a more "international name", in contrast to the original French name Stéphane.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

He was made by Janet Knechtel for [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Dom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/07/flateric.advertising |title=No strings attached &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2001-03-31|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, and was performed by [[Drew Massey]] for all the Levi's commercials. The Levi's adverts took three days to shoot.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The original short films made with Stéphane cost around 15,000 [[franc]]s to produce.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The two Levi's ads cost around two or three million francs each.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The rights to the character were retained by Oizo and production company Partizan.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt;

[[File:R-S mk2.gif|thumb|right|An SR latch, constructed from a pair of cross-coupled [[NOR gate|NOR]] [[logic gate|gates]].]]

In [[electronics]], a '''flip-flop''' or '''latch''' is a [[electronic circuit|circuit]] that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. A flip-flop is a [[bistable multivibrator]]. The circuit can be made to change state by [[signal]]s applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in [[sequential logic]]. Flip-flops and latches are fundamental building blocks of [[digital electronics]] systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.

Flip-flops and latches are used as data storage elements.  A flip-flop is a device which stores a single ''[[bit]]'' (binary digit) of data; one of its two states represents a "one" and the other represents a "zero".  Such data storage can be used for storage of ''[[state (computer science)|state]]'', and such a circuit is described as [[sequential logic]] in electronics. When used in a [[finite-state machine]], the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.

Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or [[clock signal|clock]]ed ([[synchronous]] or edge-triggered).  Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term ''flip-flop'' exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called ''latches''.&lt;ref name="pedroni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ee42"/&gt;

Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.

The first electronic flip-flop was invented in 1918 by the British physicists [[William Eccles]] and [[F. W. Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Eccles and Frank Wilfred Jordan, "[http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB148582&amp;F=0&amp;QPN=GB148582 Improvements in ionic relays]" British patent number: GB 148582 (filed: 21 June 1918; published: 5 August 1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

Early flip-flops were known variously as trigger circuits or [[multivibrator]]s.

According to P. L. Lindley, an engineer at the US [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], the flip-flop types detailed below (SR, D, T, JK) were first discussed in a 1954 [[UCLA]] course on computer design by Montgomery Phister, and then appeared in his book ''Logical Design of Digital Computers.''&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Lindley, Aug. 1968, [[EDN (magazine)]], (letter dated June 13, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lindley was at the time working at Hughes Aircraft under Eldred Nelson, who had coined the term JK for a flip-flop which changed states when both inputs were on (a logical "one"). The other names were coined by Phister. They differ slightly from some of the definitions given below.  Lindley explains that he heard the story of the JK flip-flop from Eldred Nelson, who is responsible for coining the term while working at [[Hughes Aircraft]].  Flip-flops in use at Hughes at the time were all of the type that came to be known as J-K. In designing a logical system, Nelson assigned letters to flip-flop inputs as follows: #1: A &amp; B, #2: C &amp; D, #3: E &amp; F, #4: G &amp; H, #5: J &amp; K.  Nelson used the notations "''j''-input" and "''k''-input" in a patent application filed in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[File:TTL flip-flop.svg|thumb|right|200px|A traditional (simple) flip-flop circuit based on [[bipolar junction transistor]]s]]

Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or asynchronous) or clocked (synchronous). The simple ones are commonly described as ''latches'',&lt;ref name="pedroni"&gt;{{cite book|first=Volnei A. |last=Pedroni |title=Digital electronics and design with VHDL |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZAccwyQeXMC |date=2008 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |isbn=978-0-12-374270-4 |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the clocked ones are described as ''flip-flops''.&lt;ref name="ee42"&gt;[http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/ee100/pdf/lect24.pdf Latches and Flip Flops] (EE 42/100 Lecture 24 from Berkeley)  ''"...Sometimes the terms flip-flop and latch are used interchangeably..."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple flip-flops can be built around a single pair of cross-coupled inverting elements: [[vacuum tube]]s, [[bipolar transistor]]s, [[field effect transistor]]s, [[inverter (logic gate)|inverter]]s, and inverting [[logic gate]]s have all been used in practical circuits.

Clocked devices are specially designed for synchronous systems; such devices ignore their inputs except at the transition of a dedicated clock signal (known as clocking, pulsing, or strobing). Clocking causes the flip-flop either to change or to retain its output signal based upon the values of the input signals at the transition. Some flip-flops change output on the rising [[signal edge|edge]] of the clock, others on the falling edge.

Since the elementary amplifying stages are inverting, two stages can be connected in succession (as a cascade) to form the needed non-inverting amplifier. In this configuration, each amplifier may be considered as an active inverting feedback network for the other inverting amplifier. Thus the two stages are connected in a non-inverting loop although the circuit diagram is usually drawn as a symmetric cross-coupled pair (both the [[:File:Eccles-Jordan trigger circuit flip-flip drawings.png|drawings]] are initially introduced in the Eccles–Jordan patent).

== Flip-flop types ==
Flip-flops can be divided into common types: the '''SR''' ("set-reset"), '''D''' ("data" or "delay"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first=Sajjan G. |last=Shiva |title=Computer design and architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKQFttdG7hcC |edition=3rd |year=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-0368-4 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;), '''T''' ("toggle"), and '''JK'''. The behavior of a particular type can be described by what is termed the characteristic equation, which derives the "next" (i.e., after the next clock pulse) output, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;next&lt;/SUB&gt;}} in terms of the input signal(s) and/or the current output, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

When using static gates as building blocks, the most fundamental latch is the simple ''SR latch'', where S and R stand for ''set'' and ''reset''. It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled [[NOR gate|NOR]] [[logic gate]]s.  The stored bit is present on the output marked Q.

While the R and S inputs are both low, [[feedback]] maintains the Q and {{overline|Q}} outputs in a constant state, with {{overline|Q}} the complement of Q.  If S (''Set'') is pulsed high while R (''Reset'') is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high when S returns to low; similarly, if R is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low when R returns to low.

''Note: X means ''don't care'', that is, either 0 or 1 is a valid value.''

The R = S = 1 combination is called a '''restricted combination''' or a '''forbidden state''' because, as both NOR gates then output zeros, it breaks the logical equation Q = '''not''' {{overline|Q}}. The combination is also inappropriate in circuits where ''both'' inputs may go low ''simultaneously'' (i.e. a transition from ''restricted'' to ''keep'').  The output would lock at either 1 or 0 depending on the propagation time relations between the gates (a [[race condition]]).

To overcome the restricted combination, one can add gates to the inputs that would convert &lt;tt&gt;(S,R) = (1,1)&lt;/tt&gt; to one of the non-restricted combinations. That can be:
* Q = 1 (1,0) – referred to as an ''S (dominated)-latch''
* Q = 0 (0,1) – referred to as an ''R (dominated)-latch''
This is done in nearly every [[programmable logic controller]].
* Keep state (0,0) – referred to as an ''E-latch''
Alternatively, the restricted combination can be made to ''toggle'' the output. The result is the [[#JK latch|JK latch]].

The characteristic equation for the SR latch is :

&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{next} = \bar{R}Q + \bar{R}S&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Q_\text{next} = \bar{R}(Q + S).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Ptc. Ltd. |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-02-3110-1 |page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another expression is :

&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{next} = S + \bar{R}Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;SR = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ee.usyd.edu.au/tutorials/digital_tutorial/part3/fl-types.htm "Summary of the Types of Flip-flop Behaviour"]. Retrieved on 16 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{overline|SR}} NAND latch====
[[File:SR Flip-flop Diagram.svg|thumb|right|An {{overline|SR}} latch constructed from cross-coupled [[NAND gates]].]]

This is an alternate model of the simple SR latch which is built with [[NAND gate|NAND]] [[logic gate]]s. ''Set'' and ''reset'' now become active low signals, denoted {{overline|S}} and {{overline|R}} respectively. Otherwise, operation is identical to that of the SR latch. Historically, {{overline|SR}}-latches have been predominant despite the notational inconvenience of [[logic level|active-low]] inputs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==== SR AND-OR latch ====
[[File:RS-and-or-flip-flop.png|thumb|An SR AND-OR latch. Light green means logical '1' and dark green means logical '0'. The latch is currently in hold mode (no change).]]
From the teaching point of view, SR latches realised as a pair of cross-coupled components (transistors, gates, tubes, etc.) are rather hard to understand for beginners. A didactically easier to understand model uses a single feedback loop instead of the cross-coupling. The following is an SR latch built with an [[AND gate|AND]] gate with one [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverted]] input and an [[OR gate|OR]] gate.

|}

====JK latch====
The JK latch is much less frequently used than the JK flip-flop. The JK latch follows the following state table:

{|class = wikitable
|-
|colspan = 5| '''JK latch truth table'''
|-
|'''J''' || '''K''' || '''Q&lt;sub&gt;next&lt;/sub&gt;''' || '''Comment'''
|-
| 0        || 0       || Q || No change
|-
| 0        || 1       || 0                || Reset
|-
| 1        || 0       || 1                || Set
|-
| 1        || 1       || {{overline|Q}} || Toggle
|}

Hence, the JK latch is an SR latch that is made to ''toggle'' its output (oscillate between 0 and 1) when passed the input combination of 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Diederich |last=Hinrichsen |first2=Anthony J. |last2=Pritchard |title=Mathematical Systems Theory I: Modelling, State Space Analysis, Stability and Robustness |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540264101|pages=63–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u4JYt7OdptYC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the JK flip-flop, the 11 input combination for the JK latch is not very useful because there is no clock that directs toggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hassan A. |last=Farhat |title=Digital design and computer organization |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwZZcgAACAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-1191-8 |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gated latches and conditional transparency===

Latches are designed to be ''transparent.'' That is, input signal changes cause immediate changes in output. Additional logic can be added to a simple transparent latch to make it ''non-transparent'' or ''opaque'' when another input (an "enable" input) is not asserted. When several ''transparent'' latches follow each other, using the same enable signal, signals can propagate through all of them at once. However, by following a ''transparent-high'' latch with a ''transparent-low'' (or ''opaque-high'') latch, a master–slave flip-flop is implemented.

====Gated SR latch====
[[File:SR (Clocked) Flip-flop Diagram.svg|frame|A gated SR latch circuit diagram constructed from [[AND gate|AND]] gates (on left) and [[NOR gates|NOR]] gates (on right).]]

A ''synchronous SR latch'' (sometimes ''clocked SR flip-flop'') can be made by adding a second level of NAND gates to the inverted SR latch (or a second level of AND gates to the direct SR latch). The extra NAND gates further invert the inputs so the simple {{overline|SR}} latch becomes a gated SR latch (and a simple SR latch would transform into a gated {{overline|SR}} latch with inverted enable).

With E high (''enable'' true), the signals can pass through the input gates to the encapsulated latch; all signal combinations except for (0,0) = ''hold'' then immediately reproduce on the (Q,{{overline|Q}}) output, i.e. the latch is ''transparent''.

With E low (''enable'' false) the latch is ''closed (opaque)'' and remains in the state it was left the last time E was high.

The ''enable'' input is sometimes a [[clock signal]], but more often a read or write strobe. When the ''enable'' input is a clock signal, the latch is said to be '''level-sensitive''' (to the level of the clock signal), as opposed to '''edge-sensitive''' like flip-flops below.

[[Image:Multiplexer-based latch using transmission gates.svg|thumb|300px|A gated D latch in [[pass transistor logic]], similar to the ones in the CD4042 or the CD74HC75 integrated circuits. ]]

This latch exploits the fact that, in the two active input combinations (01 and 10) of a gated SR latch, R is the complement of S. The input NAND stage converts the two D input states (0 and 1) to these two input combinations for the next {{overline|SR}} latch by inverting the data input signal. The low state of the ''enable'' signal produces the inactive "11" combination. Thus a gated D-latch may be considered as a ''one-input synchronous SR latch''. This configuration prevents application of the restricted input combination. It is also known as ''transparent latch'', ''data latch'', or simply ''gated latch''. It has a ''data'' input and an ''enable'' signal (sometimes named ''clock'', or ''control''). The word ''transparent'' comes from the fact that, when the enable input is on, the signal propagates directly through the circuit, from the input D to the output Q. Gated D-latches are also '''level-sensitive''' with respect to the level of the clock or enable signal.

Transparent latches are typically used as I/O ports or in asynchronous systems, or in synchronous two-phase systems ([[synchronous system]]s that use a [[two-phase clock]]), where two latches operating on different clock phases prevent data transparency as in a master–slave flip-flop.

Latches are available as [[integrated circuit]]s, usually with multiple latches per chip.  For example, 74HC75 is a quadruple transparent latch in the [[7400 series]].

A successful alternative is the Earle latch. It requires only a single data input, and its output takes a constant two gate delays.  In addition, the two gate levels of the Earle latch can, in some cases, be merged with the last two gate levels of the circuits driving the latch because many common computational circuits have an OR layer followed by an AND layer as their last two levels. Merging the latch function can implement the latch with no additional gate delays.&lt;ref name=kogge/&gt;  The merge is commonly exploited in the design of pipelined computers, and, in fact, was originally developed by John G.

=== D flip-flop ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Counter (digital)|Counter]] --&gt;
[[File:D-Type Flip-flop.svg|frame|right|D flip-flop symbol]]

The D flip-flop is widely used. It is also known as a "data" or "delay" flip-flop.

The D flip-flop captures the value of the D-input at a definite portion of the clock cycle (such as the rising edge of the clock). That captured value becomes the Q output. At other times, the output Q does not change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/sequential/d_nand_flip-flop.html The D Flip-Flop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.usyd.edu.au/tutorials/digital_tutorial/part2/flip-flop02.html Edge-Triggered Flip-flops]&lt;/ref&gt; The D flip-flop can be viewed as a memory cell, a [[zero-order hold]], or a [[Analog delay line|delay line]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4051207&amp;tag=1 A Survey of Digital Computer Memory Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most D-type flip-flops in ICs have the capability to be forced to the set or reset state (which ignores the D and clock inputs), much like an SR flip-flop. Usually, the illegal S = R = 1 condition is resolved in D-type flip-flops. By setting S = R = 0, the flip-flop can be used as described above. Here is the truth table for the others S and R possible configurations:

[[File:4 Bit Shift Register 001.svg|thumb|right|4-bit [[Shift register#Serial-in, parallel-out (SIPO)|serial-in, parallel-out (SIPO) shift register]]]]

These flip-flops are very useful, as they form the basis for [[shift registers]], which are an essential part of many electronic devices.  The advantage of the D flip-flop over the D-type "transparent latch" is that the signal on the D input pin is captured the moment the flip-flop is clocked, and subsequent changes on the D input will be ignored until the next clock event. An exception is that some flip-flops have a "reset" signal input, which will reset Q (to zero), and may be either asynchronous or synchronous with the clock.

The above circuit shifts the contents of the register to the right, one bit position on each active transition of the clock. The input X is shifted into the leftmost bit position.

==== Classical positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop ====
[[File:Edge triggered D flip flop.svg|thumb|right|A positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop]]
This circuit&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn7474.pdf SN7474 TI datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two stages implemented by [[#SR NAND latch|&lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;SR&lt;/span&gt; NAND latches]]. The input stage (the two latches on the left) processes the clock and data signals to ensure correct input signals for the output stage (the single latch on the right). If the clock is low, both the output signals of the input stage are high regardless of the data input; the output latch is unaffected and it stores the previous state. When the clock signal changes from low to high, only one of the output voltages (depending on the data signal) goes low and sets/resets the output latch: if D = 0, the lower output becomes low; if D = 1, the upper output becomes low. If the clock signal continues staying high, the outputs keep their states regardless of the data input and force the output latch to stay in the corresponding state as the input logical zero (of the output stage) remains active while the clock is high. Hence the role of the output latch is to store the data only while the clock is low.

The circuit is closely related to the [[#Gated D latch|gated D latch]] as both the circuits convert the two D input states (0 and 1) to two input combinations (01 and 10) for the output &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;SR&lt;/span&gt; latch by inverting the data input signal (both the circuits split the single D signal in two complementary &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; signals). The difference is that in the gated D latch simple NAND logical gates are used while in the positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;SR&lt;/span&gt; NAND latches are used for this purpose. The role of these latches is to "lock" the active output producing low voltage (a logical zero); thus the positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop can also be thought of as a gated D latch with latched input gates.

====Master–slave edge-triggered D flip-flop====

[[File:Negative-edge triggered master slave D flip-flop.svg|thumb|right|300px|A master–slave D flip-flop. It responds on the falling edge of the ''enable'' input (usually a clock)]]

[[File:D-Type Flip-flop Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|An implementation of a master–slave D flip-flop that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock]]

A master–slave D flip-flop is created by connecting two [[gated D latch]]es in series, and inverting the ''enable'' input to one of them. It is called master–slave because the second latch in the series only changes in response to a change in the first (master) latch.

For a positive-edge triggered master–slave D flip-flop, when the clock signal is low (logical 0) the "enable" seen by the first or "master" D latch (the inverted clock signal) is high (logical 1). This allows the "master" latch to store the input value when the clock signal transitions from low to high. As the clock signal goes high (0 to 1) the inverted "enable" of the first latch goes low (1 to 0) and the value seen at the input to the master latch is "locked". Nearly simultaneously, the twice inverted "enable" of the second or "slave" D latch transitions from low to high (0 to 1) with the clock signal. This allows the signal captured at the rising edge of the clock by the now "locked" master latch to pass through the "slave" latch. When the clock signal returns to low (1 to 0), the output of the "slave" latch is "locked", and the value seen at the last rising edge of the clock is held while the "master" latch begins to accept new values in preparation for the next rising clock edge.

By removing the leftmost inverter in the circuit at side, a D-type flip-flop that strobes on the ''falling edge'' of a clock signal can be obtained. This has a truth table like this:

::{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
||'''D'''||'''Q'''||'''&gt;'''||'''Q&lt;sub&gt;next&lt;/sub&gt;'''

====Dual-edge-triggered D flip-flop====
[[File:D-Type Flip-flop dual Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|An implementation of a master–slave D flip-flop that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock]]

Flip-Flops that read in a new value on the rising and the falling edge of the clock are called dual-edge-triggered flip-flops. Such a flip-flop may be built using two single-edge -triggered D-type flip-flops and a multiplexer as shown in the image.

[[File:D-Type Flip-flop dual.svg|frame|right|Circuit symbol of a dual-edge-triggered D flip-flop.]]

====Edge-triggered dynamic D storage element====
An efficient functional alternative to a D flip-flop can be made with dynamic circuits (where information is stored in a capacitance) as long as it is clocked often enough; while not a true flip-flop, it is still called a flip-flop for its functional role. While the master–slave D element is triggered on the edge of a clock, its components are each triggered by clock levels. The "edge-triggered D flip-flop", as it is called even though it is not a true flip-flop, does not have the master–slave properties.

Edge-triggered D flip-flops are often implemented in integrated high-speed operations using [[dynamic logic (digital electronics)|dynamic logic]].  This means that the digital output is stored on parasitic device capacitance while the device is not transitioning.  This design of dynamic flip flops also enables simple resetting since the reset operation can be performed by simply discharging one or more internal nodes. A common dynamic flip-flop variety is the true single-phase clock (TSPC) type which performs the flip-flop operation with little power and at high speeds.  However, dynamic flip-flops will typically not work at static or low clock speeds: given enough time, leakage paths may discharge the parasitic capacitance enough to cause the flip-flop to enter invalid states.

===T flip-flop===
[[File:T-Type Flip-flop.svg|frame|right|A circuit symbol for a T-type flip-flop]]
If the T input is high, the T flip-flop changes state ("toggles") whenever the clock input is strobed. If the T input is low, the flip-flop holds the previous value. This behavior is described by the characteristic [[equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{next} = T \oplus Q = T\overline{Q} + \overline{T}Q&lt;/math&gt;   (expanding the [[XOR gate|XOR]] operator)

and can be described in a [[truth table]]:

When T is held high, the toggle flip-flop divides the clock frequency by two; that is, if clock frequency is 4&amp;nbsp;MHz, the output frequency obtained from the flip-flop will be 2&amp;nbsp;MHz. This "divide by" feature has application in various types of digital [[Counter (digital)|counter]]s.  A T flip-flop can also be built using a JK flip-flop (J &amp; K pins are connected together and act as T) or a D flip-flop (T input XOR Q&lt;sub&gt;previous&lt;/sub&gt; drives the D input).

=== JK flip-flop ===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[JK flip-flop]] and [[j-k ff]] --&gt;

[[File:JK Flip-flop (Simple) Symbol.svg|frame|right|A circuit symbol for a positive-edge-triggered JK flip-flop]]
[[File:JK timing diagram.svg|thumb|right|JK flip-flop timing diagram]]

The JK flip-flop augments the behavior of the SR flip-flop (J=Set, K=Reset) by interpreting the J = K = 1 condition as a "flip" or toggle command. Specifically, the combination J = 1, K = 0 is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination J = 0, K = 1 is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination J = K = 1 is a command to toggle the flip-flop, i.e., change its output to the logical complement of its current value. Setting J = K = 0 maintains the current state.  To synthesize a D flip-flop, simply set K equal to the complement of J. Similarly, to synthesize a T flip-flop, set K equal to J. The JK flip-flop is therefore a universal flip-flop, because it can be configured to work as an SR flip-flop, a D flip-flop, or a T flip-flop.

The characteristic equation of the JK flip-flop is:

&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{next} = J\overline Q + \overline KQ&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding truth table is:

== Timing considerations ==

=== Timing parameters ===
[[File:FF Tsetup Thold Toutput.svg|thumb|right|Flip-flop setup, hold and clock-to-output timing parameters]]

The input must be held steady in a period around the rising edge of the clock known as the aperture. Imagine taking a picture of a frog on a lily-pad.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=S|last2=Harris|first2=D|title=Digital Design and Computer Architecture - ARM Edition,|date=2016|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann, Waltham, MA|isbn=978-0-12-800056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Suppose the frog then jumps into the water.  If you take a picture of the frog as it jumps into the water, you will get a blurry picture of the frog jumping into the water—it's not clear which state the frog was in.  But if you take a picture while the frog sits steadily on the pad (or is steadily in the water), you will get a clear picture.  In the same way, the input to a flip-flop must be held steady during the '''aperture''' of the flip-flop.

'''Setup time''' is the minimum amount of time the data input should be held steady '''before''' the clock event, so that the data is reliably sampled by the clock.

'''Hold time''' is the minimum amount of time the data input should be held steady '''after''' the clock event, so that the data is reliably sampled by the clock.

'''Aperture''' is the sum of setup and hold time. The data input should be held steady throughout this time period.&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt;

'''Recovery time''' is the minimum amount of time the asynchronous set or reset input should be inactive '''before''' the clock event, so that the data is reliably sampled by the clock.  The recovery time for the asynchronous set or reset input is thereby similar to the setup time for the data input.

'''Removal time''' is the minimum amount of time the asynchronous set or reset input should be inactive '''after''' the clock event, so that the data is reliably sampled by the clock.  The removal time for the asynchronous set or reset input is thereby similar to the hold time for the data input.

Short impulses applied to asynchronous inputs (set, reset) should not be applied completely within the recovery-removal period, or else it becomes entirely indeterminable whether the flip-flop will transition to the appropriate state. In another case, where an asynchronous signal simply makes one transition that happens to fall between the recovery/removal time, eventually the flip-flop will transition to the appropriate state, but a very short glitch may or may not appear on the output, dependent on the synchronous input signal. This second situation may or may not have significance to a circuit design.

Set and Reset (and other) signals may be either synchronous or asynchronous and therefore may be characterized with either Setup/Hold or Recovery/Removal times, and synchronicity is very dependent on the design of the flip-flop.
 
Differentiation between Setup/Hold and Recovery/Removal times is often necessary when verifying the timing of larger circuits because asynchronous signals may be found to be less critical than synchronous signals. The differentiation offers circuit designers the ability to define the verification conditions for these types of signals independently.

=== Metastability ===
{{main | Metastability in electronics}}

Flip-flops are subject to a problem called [[Metastability in electronics|metastability]], which can happen when two inputs, such as data and clock or clock and reset, are changing at about the same time.  When the order is not clear, within appropriate timing constraints, the result is that the output may behave unpredictably, taking many times longer than normal to settle to one state or the other, or even oscillating several times before settling. Theoretically, the time to settle down is not bounded. In a [[computer]] system, this metastability can cause corruption of data or a program crash if the state is not stable before another circuit uses its value; in particular, if two different logical paths use the output of a flip-flop, one path can interpret it as a 0 and the other as a 1 when it has not resolved to stable state, putting the machine into an inconsistent state.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metastability in flip-flops can be avoided by ensuring that the data and control inputs are held valid and constant for specified periods before and after the clock pulse, called the '''setup time''' (t&lt;sub&gt;su&lt;/sub&gt;) and the '''hold time''' (t&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively.  These times are specified in the data sheet for the device, and are typically between a few nanoseconds and a few hundred picoseconds for modern devices. Depending upon the flip-flop's internal organization, it is possible to build a device with a zero (or even negative) setup or hold time requirement but not both simultaneously.

Unfortunately, it is not always possible to meet the setup and hold criteria, because the flip-flop may be connected to a real-time signal that could change at any time, outside the control of the designer. In this case, the best the designer can do is to reduce the probability of error to a certain level, depending on the required reliability of the circuit. One technique for suppressing metastability is to connect two or more flip-flops in a chain, so that the output of each one feeds the data input of the next, and all devices share a common clock. With this method, the probability of a metastable event can be reduced to a negligible value, but never to zero. The probability of metastability gets closer and closer to zero as the number of flip-flops connected in series is increased. The number of flip-flops being cascaded is referred to as the "ranking"; "dual-ranked" flip flops (two flip-flops in series) is a common situation.

So-called metastable-hardened flip-flops are available, which work by reducing the setup and hold times as much as possible, but even these cannot eliminate the problem entirely. This is because metastability is more than simply a matter of circuit design. When the transitions in the clock and the data are close together in time, the flip-flop is forced to decide which event happened first. However fast the device is made, there is always the possibility that the input events will be so close together that it cannot detect which one happened first. It is therefore logically impossible to build a perfectly metastable-proof flip-flop. Flip-flops are sometimes characterized for a maximum settling time (the maximum time they will remain metastable under specified conditions). In this case, dual-ranked flip-flops that are clocked slower than the maximum allowed metastability time will provide proper conditioning for asynchronous (e.g., external) signals.

===Propagation delay===
Another important timing value for a flip-flop is the clock-to-output delay (common symbol in data sheets: t&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[propagation delay]] (t&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the time a flip-flop takes to change its output after the clock edge. The time for a high-to-low transition (t&lt;sub&gt;PHL&lt;/sub&gt;) is sometimes different from the time for a low-to-high transition (t&lt;sub&gt;PLH&lt;/sub&gt;).

When cascading flip-flops which share the same clock (as in a [[shift register]]), it is important to ensure that the t&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of a preceding flip-flop is longer than the hold time (t&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) of the following flip-flop, so data present at the input of the succeeding flip-flop is properly "shifted in" following the active edge of the clock. This relationship between t&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is normally guaranteed if the flip-flops are physically identical. Furthermore, for correct operation, it is easy to verify that the clock period has to be greater than the sum t&lt;sub&gt;su&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;t&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Generalizations==
Flip-flops can be generalized in at least two ways: by making them 1-of-N instead of 1-of-2, and by adapting them to logic with more than two states.  In the special cases of 1-of-3 encoding, or multi-valued [[ternary logic]], these elements may be referred to as ''flip-flap-flops''.&lt;ref&gt;Often attributed to [[Don Knuth]] (1969) (see {{cite book| author = Midhat J. Gazalé| title = Number: from Ahmes to Cantor| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WO1gQYIrG24C| year = 2000| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-00515-7| page = 57 }}), the term ''flip-flap-flop'' actually appeared much earlier in the computing literature, for example,

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conventional flip-flop, exactly one of the two complementary outputs is high.  This can be generalized to a memory element with N outputs, exactly one of which is high (alternatively, where exactly one of N is low).  The output is therefore always a [[one-hot]] (respectively ''one-cold'') representation.  The construction is similar to a conventional cross-coupled flip-flop; each output, when high, inhibits all the other outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenmuseum.com/1411FlipFlap_engl.html |title=Ternary "flip-flap-flop"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, more or less conventional flip-flops can be used, one per output, with additional circuitry to make sure only one at a time can be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|6975152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another generalization of the conventional flip-flop is a memory element for [[multi-valued logic]].  In this case the memory element retains exactly one of the logic states until the control inputs induce a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Flip-Flops for Multiple-Valued Logic

'''Foxfire''', also called '''fairy fire''' or '''[[chimpanzee]] fire'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Congo |series=[[Africa (TV series)|Africa]] |network=[[BBC One]] |date=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is the [[bioluminescence]] created by some species of [[fungus|fungi]] present in decaying wood. The bluish-green glow is attributed to a [[luciferase]], an oxidative enzyme, which emits light as it reacts with a [[luciferin]]. The phenomenon has been known since ancient times, with its source determined in 1823.

== Description ==
Foxfire is the [[bioluminescence]]  created by some species of [[fungus|fungi]] present in decaying wood. It occurs in a number of species, including ''[[Panellus stipticus]]'', ''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'', and ''[[Omphalotus nidiformis]].'' The bluish-green glow is attributed to a [[luciferase]], an oxidative enzyme, which emits light as it reacts with a [[luciferin]]. Some believe that the light attracts insects to spread spores, or acts as a warning to hungry animals, like the bright colors exhibited by some poisonous or unpalatable animal species.&lt;ref name="inamidst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/lights/foxfire|title=Foxfire:Bioluminescent Fungi|publisher=inamidst.com|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although generally very dim, in some cases foxfire is bright enough to read by.&lt;ref name="mykoweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mykoweb.com/articles/BioluminescentFungi.html|title=Bioluminescent Fungi|publisher=Mykoweb|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest recorded documentation of foxfire is from 382&amp;nbsp;B.C., by [[Aristotle]], whose notes refer to a light that, unlike fire, was cold to the touch. The Roman thinker [[Pliny the Elder]] also mentioned glowing wood in olive groves.&lt;ref name="warnell"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Warnell School of Forest Resources| title=Foxfire: Bioluminescence in the Forest| accessdate=July 18, 2011| url=http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/service/library/index.php3?docID=173| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719224836/http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/service/library/index.php3?docID=173| archivedate=July 19, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxfire was used to illuminate the needles on the barometer and the compass of ''[[American Turtle|Turtle]]'', an early submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Navy Department Library| title=The Submarine Turtle: Naval Documents of the Revolutionary War| accessdate=May 1, 2012| url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sub_turtle.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917024301/http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sub_turtle.htm| dead-url=yes| archive-date=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is commonly thought to have been suggested by [[Benjamin Franklin]]; a reading of the correspondence from Benjamin Gale, however, shows that Benjamin Franklin was only consulted for alternative forms of lighting when the cold temperatures rendered the foxfire inactive.

After many more literary references to foxfire by early scientists and naturalists, its cause was discovered in 1823. The glow emitted from wooden support beams in mines was examined, and it was found that the luminescence came from fungal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Journey Idea| title=Bioluminescent foxfire, Bioluminescence facts, Bioluminescent fungi| accessdate=July 18, 2011| url=http://www.journeyidea.com/firefox-that-glows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fox" in "foxfire" may derive from the Old French word ''fols'', meaning "false", rather than from the name of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;Smythe Palmer, Abram, ''The Folk and Their Word-lore: An Essay on Popular Etymologies'' (1904)&lt;/ref&gt; The association of foxes with such fires is widespread, however, and occurs also in Japanese folklore.

'''Helsinki Challenge''' is a science-based competition and idea accelerator which brings together the academic community and society at large to solve the world’s grand challenges in cooperation. The competition goal is not only to create new scientific information, but to influence society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/blog/prepare-for-the-unexpected |title=Prepare for the unexpected - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts from the academic and artistic communities, the business world, the public and third sectors, media and other actors of the society are welcome to take part in the competition. Participating teams are evaluated by the jury using the following criteria: originality, creativity, impact, focus on solutions and use of science-based methods. The competition prize is 375,000 euros and it is meant for the implementation of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |title=How to participate? - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626135757/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helsinki Challenge was held for the first time in 2015. In 2017, the competition is organised by the [[University of Helsinki]] in collaboration with [[Aalto University]], [[Hanken School of Economics]], [[University of Eastern Finland]], [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[University of Oulu]], [[University of the Arts Helsinki]], [[University of Turku]], [[University of Vaasa]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2014–2015==

The first ever Helsinki Challenge was organised by the University of Helsinki and celebrated the University’s 375th anniversary in 2015. The first Helsinki Challenge competition themes were: environmental change, health and wellbeing, future learning, global Helsinki and new world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |title=About - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134954/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifinal 2014–2015===
Out of 80 proposals, a list of 20 semifinalists were announced in December 2014. Teams’ competition ideas ranged from developing tools to analyze [[big data]] on the Finnish discussion forum [[Suomi24]] to studying our expectations of robot morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1417410726435 |title=Tiederyhmä selvittää syyllisyyttä robottien tekemissä virheissä - Tiede - Kotimaa - Helsingin Sanomat |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mika Pantzar |url=http://wau.fi/artikkelit/big-dataa-riittaa-mutta-riittaako-suomessa-kykya-hyodyntaa-sita |title=Big dataa riittää, mutta riittääkö Suomessa kykyä hyödyntää sitä? |publisher=Wau.fi |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final 2014–2015===

In October 2015, the five finalist teams were chosen:  Moralities of Intelligent Machines, Biodiversity Now, Helsinki Sleep Factory, SafePreg – Health into Next Generation and NEMO - Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction.  The jury for the final included Chancellor Thomas Wilhelmsson (chair), Pro-Vice Chancellor of Education [[Sally Mapstone]] from the [[University of Oxford]], Professor of Practice Pasi Sahlberg from [[Harvard University]]’s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], Director Ulrich Weinberg from the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] School of Design Thinking and President Mikko Kosonen of the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]].

====Winner teams====

The €375,000 prize for the science-based idea competition Helsinki Challenge was divided between two teams. The winner was NEMO – Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received €250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received €125,000.The prize money is intended for realising the team’s idea.

NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online.The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions.This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction.The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications.

Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy-receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize-of-250000?publisherId=1807796&amp;releaseId=36507619&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2016–2017==

The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016. The winner will be announced in conjunction with the centennial of [[Finland]]'s independence in 2017. The new Helsinki Challenge themes: Sustainable Plant, Urban Future and People in Change are linked to the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The intention is to create solutions for future wellbeing through cooperation with a range of different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human liquor''' means [[waste]] content from [[bowel]]s isolated to investigate specific [[enzyme]]s and [[peptidase]]s involved in [[enteric]] contraction and [[digestion]] of compounds.

P-endopeptidase isolated from human liquor inactivates [[tachykinin peptides|tachykinins]].  [[Hydrolysis]] of Substance P by P-endopeptidase yields the active fragment of substance P.  A [[neuroactive]] peptide, Substance P is found throughout the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]].  It has mostly been studied for its contractive effect on enteric [[musculature]].

&lt;!-- [[Image:SoftwareEchoscape.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Screensave of active hydroacoustics detecting fish.]] image deleted on commons --&gt;
'''Hydroacoustics''' is the study and application of sound in water.  Hydroacoustics, using [[sonar]] technology, is most commonly used for monitoring of underwater physical and biological characteristics. 
[[File:Collecting Multibeam Sonar Data.jpg|thumb|Collecting Multibeam Sonar Data]] 

Hydroacoustics can be used to detect the depth of a water body ([[bathymetry]]), as well as the presence or absence, abundance, distribution, size, and behavior of underwater plants&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/pls/erdcpub/!www_fact_sheet.product_page?ps_product_numb=112825&amp;tmp_Main_Topic=&amp;page=STATUS  &lt;/ref&gt; and animals.  Hydroacoustic sensing involves "[[passive acoustics]]" (listening for sounds) or ''[[active acoustics]]'' making a sound and listening for the echo, hence the common name for the device, [[echo sounder]] or [[echosounder]].  

There are a number of different causes of noise from shipping. These can be subdivided into those caused by the propeller, those caused by machinery, and those caused by the movement of the hull through the water. The relative importance of these three different categories will depend, amongst other things, on the ship type&lt;ref&gt; reducing underwater noise pollution from large commercial vessels &lt;/ref&gt;
One of the main causes of hydro acoustic noise from fully submerged lifting surfaces is the unsteady separated turbulent flow near the surface's trailing edge that produces pressure fluctuations on the surface and unsteady oscillatory flow in the near wake.The relative motion between the surface and the ocean creates a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) that surrounds the surface. The noise is generated by the fluctuating velocity and pressure fields within this TBL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27140">An '''imaging cycler microscope (ICM)''' is a fully automated (epi)[[fluorescence microscope]] which overcomes the spectral resolution limit resulting in parameter- and dimension-unlimited fluorescence imaging.  The principle and robotic device was described by Walter Schubert in 1997 &lt;ref name=ref1&gt;Schubert W (1997) Automated device and method for measuring and identifying molecules or fragments thereof. European patent EP 0810428 B1 [see also Schubert W. US patent 6,150,173 (2000); Japanese patent 3739528 (1998)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ever since has been further developed with his co-workers within the human [[toponome]] project.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cottingham|first=Katie|title=Human Toponome Project {{!}} Human Proteinpedia is open for (free) business|journal=Journal of Proteome Research|date=May 2008|volume=7|issue=5|pages=1806|doi=10.1021/pr083701k}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Walter|author2=Bonnekoh, Bernd |author3=Pommer, Ansgar J |author4=Philipsen, Lars |author5=Böckelmann, Raik |author6=Malykh, Yanina |author7=Gollnick, Harald |author8=Friedenberger, Manuela |author9=Bode, Marcus |author10= Dress, Andreas W M |title=Analyzing proteome topology and function by automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=1 October 2006|volume=24|issue=10|pages=1270–1278|doi=10.1038/nbt1250 |pmid=17013374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedenberger|first=Manuela|author2=Bode, Marcus |author3=Krusche, Andreas |author4= Schubert, Walter |title=Fluorescence detection of protein clusters in individual cells and tissue sections by using toponome imaging system: sample preparation and measuring procedures|journal=Nature Protocols|date=September 2007|volume=2|issue=9|pages=2285–2294|doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.320|pmid=17853885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{cite web|last=Schubert|first=W|title=Direct, spatial imaging of randomly large supermolecules by using parameter unlimited TIS imaging cycler microscopy.|url=http://www.toposnomos.com/doku/MC2013.pdf|publisher=International Microscopy Conference 2013|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICM runs robotically controlled repetitive incubation-imaging-bleaching cycles  with dye-conjugated probe libraries recognizing target structures in situ (biomolecules in fixed cells or tissue sections). This results in the transmission of a randomly large number of distinct biological informations by re-using the same fluorescence channel after bleaching for the transmission of another biological information using the same dye which is conjugated to another specific probe, a.s.o. Thereby noise-reduced quasi-multi channel fluorescence images with reproducible physical, geometrical, and biophyscial stabilities are generated. The resulting power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) per data point is given by 65,536&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, where 65,536  is the number of grey value levels (output of a 16-bit CCD camera) and ''k'' is the number of co-mapped biomolecules and/or subdomains per biomolecule(s). High PCMD has been shown for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100,&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; and in principle can be expanded for much higher numbers of&amp;nbsp;''k''.  In contrast to traditional multi-channel-few parameter fluorescence microscopy  (Fig 1a) high PCMDs in an ICM lead to high functional and spatial resolution (Fig 1b). Systematic ICM analysis of biological systems reveals the supramolecular segregation law that describes the principle of order of large, hierarchically organized biomolecular networks in situ (toponome).&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=W|title=Systematic, spatial imaging of large multimolecular assemblies and the emerging principles of supramolecular order in biological systems.|journal=Journal of Molecular Recognition|year=2014|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–18|doi=10.1002/jmr.2326|pmid=24375580|pmc=4283051}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICM is the core technology for the systematic mapping of the complete protein network code in tissues (human toponome project).&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt; The original ICM method &lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; includes any modification of the bleaching step.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8679">'''Katherine Bergeron''' is the 11th President of [[Connecticut College]] in [[New London, Connecticut]]. Selected by the College's Board of Trustees in August 2013, she took office on January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/about-president-elect-bergeron/|title=About President-elect Bergeron|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Bergeron was born in [[New London, Connecticut]] in 1958. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in music from [[Wesleyan University]] and master and doctoral degrees in music from [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/08/katherine-bergeron-musicologist-named.html|title=Katherine Bergeron, musicologist,&lt;br /&gt; named President of Connecticut College|website=musicologynow.ams-net.org|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20130820/NWS01/130829981|title=Old Lyme native Katherine Bergeron named president of Conn College|newspaper=The Day|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
As a musician and a historian, Bergeron's scholarship has focused on French music and culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/about-president-elect-bergeron/|title=About President-elect Bergeron|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a two-time recipient of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publisher' Deems-Taylor Award for her books ''Decadent Enchantments'' ([[University of California Press]], 1998) and ''Voice Lessons'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2010). ''Voice Lessons'' also received the Otto Kinkeldey Award from the American Musicological Society.

Bergeron has held professorships at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], and at [[Brown University]], where she also served as dean of the college from 2006 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20140405/NWS01/140409777|title=Katherine Bergeron inaugurated as Conn College's 11th president|newspaper=The Day|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2013, the Connecticut College Board of Trustees elected Katherine Bergeron as the 11th president of Connecticut College. Upon announcing her presidency, the chair of the board of trustees stated, “She has a tremendous ability to connect ideas and convert them into action. She is a champion of the tradition of education in the liberal arts and sciences, and, at the same time, an experienced and effective administrator with a record of successful innovation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/official-announcement/|title=Official Announcement|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergeron commented, “The notions of modern education and broad access to education are written in the DNA of Connecticut College. This tradition is so important at a time when all institutions of higher education are being asked to create new models for learning and to find new ways to expand access.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/official-announcement/|title=Official Announcement|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergeron took office on January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/about-president-elect-bergeron/|title=About President-elect Bergeron|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/|title=President-elect|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency ==
Since the first year of her presidency, Bergeron has supported the development of a new curriculum at Connecticut College, the first major transformation in 40 years. This venture in integrative education, called Connections, requires all students to make deeper linkages between the work they do in courses, in jobs, and in their lives on campus and in the world, in order to prepare them for leadership in an era of changes: liberal arts for the interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/connections/|title=Connections|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/06/30/connecticut-college-revamps-gen-ed|title=Connecticut College revamps gen ed|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/23/connecticut-college-to-try-new-approach-to-curricu/|title=Connecticut College to try new approach to curriculum|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Bergeron's tenure, Connecticut College received the largest gift in its history to support financial aid, career education, and athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2015/09/mass-ceo-gives-connecticut-school-its-largest.html|title=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2015/09/mass-ceo-gives-connecticut-school-its-largest.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The College also completed a $10 million renovation of the Charles E. Shain Library that transformed the mid-century facility into a vibrant, modern space for teaching and learning. The library has received several design awards for architectural excellence and historic renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/09/buildings/lbd/charles-e-shain-library-new-landmark-libraries-2016-winner/#_|title=Charles E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6550">==Life history method==

The method was first used when interviewing [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and specifically Native American leaders who were asked by an interviewer to describe their lives with an insight as to what it was like to be that particular [[person]]. The purpose of the interview was to capture a living picture of a disappearing (as such) people/[[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]].

Later the method was used to interview [[criminal]]s and [[prostitutes]] in [[Chicago]]. Interviewers looked at [[Social work|social]] and [[police]]-records, as well as the [[society]] in general, and asked subjects to talk about their lives. The resulting report discussed (i) Chicago at that particular time; (ii) how the subject viewed their own life (i.e. `how it was like to be this particular person') and (iii) how society viewed the subject and whether they would be [[incarceration|incarcerated]], receive help, perform social work, etc.
 
The landmark of the life history method was developed in the 1920s and most significantly embodied in [[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]] by [[W.I Thomas]] and [[Florian Znaniecki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Story of Life History: Origins of the Life History Method in Sociology|last = Goodson|first = Ivor|authorlink=Ivor Goodson|date = November 12, 2009|journal = Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;The authors employed a Polish immigrant to write his own life story which they then interpreted and analyzed. According to Martin Bulmer, it was "the first systematically collected sociological life history".&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Bulmer|title=The Chicago School of Sociology: Institutionalization, Diversity, and the Rise of Sociological Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0dJJZvcE2YC&amp;pg=PA54|date=15 August 1986|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-08005-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach later lost momentum as quantitative methods became more prevalent in American sociology. The method was revived in the 1970s, mainly through the efforts of French sociologist [[Daniel Bertaux]] and Paul Thompson whose life history research focused on such professions as bakers and fishermen. Major initiatives of the life history method were undertaken also in Germany, Italy, and Finland.

In the German context, the life history method is closely associated with the development of [[biographical research]] and biographical-narrative interviews. The [[narrative interview]] as a method for conducting open narrative interviews in empirical [[social research]] was developed in [[Germany]] around 1975. It borrowed concepts from [[Phenomenology (sociology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]), [[symbolic interactionism]] ([[George Herbert Mead]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), and [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[Karl Mannheim]]). The development and improvement of the method are closely connected to German sociologist [[Fritz Schütze]], part of the [[Bielefeld Sociologist’s Working Group]], which maintained close academic cooperation with American sociolinguists and social scientists such as [[Erving Goffman]], [[Harvey Sacks]], [[John J. Gumperz|John Gumpertz]], and [[Anselm Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Köttig|first=Michaela|last2=Völter|first2=Bettina|date=December 2015|title=„Das ist Soziologe sein!“ – Ein narratives Interview mit Fritz Schütze zur Geschichte seines Werkes in der Soziologie|url=http://www.nwrsa.de/wp-content/uploads/Schuetze-Interview_1_2017.pdf|journal=Rundbrief 69/ Dezember 2015 der Sektion Biographieforschung in der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie|volume=|pages=35 – 53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of life histories was further developed by the biographical case reconstruction method of German sociologist [[Gabriele Rosenthal]] for the analysis of life ''history'' and life ''story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-374-4/rosenthal_interpretive.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Interpretive Social Research. An Introduction.|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen|year=2018|isbn=978-3-86395-374-4|location=Göttingen|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenthal differentiates between the level of analysis of the ''narrated'' life story (''erzählte Lebensgeshichte'') and the ''experienced'' life history (''erlebte Lebensgeschichte'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=1993|title=Reconstruction of life stories: principles of selection in generating stories for narrative biographical interviews.|url=https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/5929/ssoar-tnsl-1993-1-rosenthal-reconstruction_of_life_stories.pdf?sequence=1|journal=The narrative study of lives|volume=1(1)|pages=59-91|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
In both cases, the one doing the interview should be careful not to ask "yes or no"-questions, but to get the subject to tell "the story of his or her life", in his or her own words. This is called the "[[narrative]]" method. It is common practice to begin the interview with the subject's early childhood and to proceed [[chronology|chronologically]] to the present. Another approach, dating from the Polish Peasant, is to ask participants to write their own life stories. This can be done either through competitions (as in Poland, Finland or Italy) or by collecting written life stories written spontaneously. In these countries, there are already large collections of life stories, which can be used by researchers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9613">This is a list of [[freshwater ecoregion]]s in [[Africa]] and [[Madagascar]], as identified by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF).

The WWF divides the Earth's land surface into [[ecoregion]]s, defined as "large area[s] of land or water containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species". Ecoregions are grouped into bioregions, "a complex of ecoregions that share a similar biogeographic history, and thus often have strong affinities at higher taxonomic levels (e.g. genera, families)." The Earth's land surface is divided into eight [[ecozone]]s. Most of Africa lies in the [[Afrotropic]] ecozone, although the freshwater ecoregions of North Africa have much in common with the [[Palearctic]].

Each ecoregion is also classified into '''major habitat types''', or [[biome]]s.

Many consider this classification to be quite decisive, and some propose these as stable borders for bioregional democracy initiatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16621">In [[computer science]], a '''loop invariant''' is a property of a [[Computer program|program]] [[Control flow#Loops|loop]] that is true before (and after) each iteration. It is a [[logical assertion]], sometimes checked within the code by an [[Assertion (software development)|assertion]] call. Knowing its invariant(s) is essential in understanding the effect of a loop.

In [[formal verification|formal program verification]], particularly the [[Hoare logic|Floyd-Hoare approach]], loop invariants are expressed by formal [[predicate logic]] and used to prove properties of loops and by extension [[algorithm]]s that employ loops (usually [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]] properties).
The loop invariants will be true on entry into a loop and following each iteration, so that on exit from the loop both the loop invariants and the loop termination condition can be guaranteed.

From a programming methodology viewpoint, the loop invariant can be viewed as a more abstract specification of the loop, which characterizes the deeper purpose of the loop beyond the details of this implementation. A survey article &lt;ref&gt;Carlo A. Furia, [Bertrand Meyer] and Sergey Velder. "Loop invariants: analysis, classification, and examples."ACM Computing Surveys.  vol. 46, no. 3, February 2014([http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/methodology/invariants.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; covers fundamental algorithms from many areas of computer science (searching, sorting, optimization, arithmetic etc.), characterizing each of them from the viewpoint of its invariant.

Because of the similarity of loops and [[recursion|recursive]] programs, proving partial correctness of loops with invariants is very similar to proving correctness of recursive programs via [[structural induction|induction]].  In fact, the loop invariant is often the same as the inductive hypothesis to be proved for a recursive program equivalent to a given loop.

[[Loop-invariant code motion]], which involves moving code out of the loop if that does not change the effect of the program, is not directly related to loop invariants, which are properties of the loop overall.



==Informal example==
The following [[C (programming language)|C]] [[subroutine]] &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; returns the maximum value in its argument array &lt;code&gt;a[]&lt;/code&gt;, provided its length &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is at least 1.
Comments are provided at lines 3, 6, 9, 11, and 13. Each comment makes an assertion about the values of one or more variables at that stage of the function.
The highlighted assertions within the loop body, at the beginning and end of the loop (lines 6 and 11), are exactly the same. They thus describe an invariant property of the loop.
When line 13 is reached, this invariant still holds, and it is known that the loop condition &lt;code&gt;i!=n&lt;/code&gt; from line 5 has become false. Both properties together imply that &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; equals the maximum value in &lt;code&gt;a[0...n-1]&lt;/code&gt;, that is, that the correct value is returned from line 14.
&lt;!---Usage of (source) tag see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi---&gt;
&lt;source lang="c" line highlight="6,11"&gt;
int max(int n,const int a[]) {
    int m = a[0];
    // m equals the maximum value in a[0...0]
    int i = 1;
    while (i != n) {
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]
        if (m &lt; a[i])
            m = a[i];
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i]
        ++i;
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]
    }
    // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1], and i==n
    return m;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Following a [[defensive programming]] paradigm, the loop condition &lt;code&gt;i!=n&lt;/code&gt; in line 5 should better be modified to &lt;code&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/code&gt;, in order to avoid endless looping for illegitimate negative values of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. While this change in code intuitively shouldn't make a difference, the reasoning leading to its correctness becomes somewhat more complicated, since then only &lt;code&gt;i&gt;=n&lt;/code&gt; is known in line 13. In order to obtain that also &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; holds, that condition has to be included into the loop invariant. It is easy to see that &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt;, too, is an invariant of the loop, since &lt;code&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/code&gt; in line 6 can be obtained from the (modified) loop condition in line 5, and hence &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; holds in line 11 after &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; has been incremented in line 10. However, when loop invariants have to be manually provided for formal program verification, such intuitively too obvious properties like &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; are often overlooked.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[partial correctness]] of a [[while loop]] is governed by the following rule of inference:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\{C\land I\}\;\mathrm{body}\;\{I\}} {\{I\}\;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}\;\{\lnot C\land I\}}&lt;/math&gt;

This means:
* If some property &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is preserved by the code &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; —more precisely, if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; holds after the execution of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; held beforehand— ''(upper line)'' then
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are guaranted to be false and true, respectively, after the execution of the whole loop &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt;, provided &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; was true before the loop ''(lower line)''.

In other words: The rule above is a deductive step that has as its premise the [[Hoare triple]] &lt;math&gt;\{C\land I\}\;\mathrm{body}\;\{I\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This triple is actually a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] on machine states.  It holds whenever starting from a state in which the boolean expression &lt;math&gt;C\land I&lt;/math&gt; is true and successfully executing some code called &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt;, the machine ends up in a state in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is true.  If this relation can be proven, the rule then allows us to conclude that successful execution of the program &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; will lead from a state in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is true to a state in which &lt;math&gt;\lnot C\land I&lt;/math&gt; holds.  The boolean formula &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in this rule is known as the loop invariant.

The loop invariant plays an important role in the intuitive argument for soundness of the Floyd-Hoare rule for &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops.  The loop invariant has to be true before each iteration of the loop body, and also after each iteration of the loop body.  Since a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is precisely the repeated iteration of the loop body, it follows that if the invariant is true before entering the loop, it must also be true after exiting the loop.

===Example===
The following example illustrates how this rule works.  Consider the program

 while (x &lt; 10)
     x := x+1;

One can then prove the following Hoare triple:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\leq10\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{x=10\}&lt;/math&gt;

The condition ''C'' of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10&lt;/math&gt;.  A useful loop invariant &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; has to be guessed; it will turn out that &lt;math&gt;x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is appropriate.  Under these assumptions it is possible to prove the following Hoare triple:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x&lt;10 \land x\leq10\}\; x := x+1 \;\{x\leq10\}&lt;/math&gt;

While this triple can be derived formally from the rules of Floyd-Hoare logic governing assignment, it is also intuitively justified: Computation starts in a state where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10 \land x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is true, which means simply that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10&lt;/math&gt; is true.  The computation adds 1 to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is still true (for integer x).

Under this premise, the rule for &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops permits the following conclusion:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\leq10\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1 \;\{\lnot(x&lt;10) \land x\leq10\}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the post-condition &lt;math&gt;\lnot(x&lt;10)\land x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to 10, but it is not less than 10) is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;x=10&lt;/math&gt;, which is what we wanted to show.

The property &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x&lt;/math&gt; is another invariant of the example loop, and the trivial property &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{true}&lt;/math&gt; is another one.
Applying the above inference rule to the former invariant yields &lt;math&gt;\{0 \leq x\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{10 \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Applying it to invariant &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{true}&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\{\mathrm{true}\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{10 \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is slightly more expressive.

==Programming language support==

===Eiffel===
The [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] programming language provides native support for loop invariants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]], ''Eiffel: The Language,'' [[Prentice Hall]], 1991, pp. 129–131.&lt;/ref&gt; A loop invariant is expressed with the same syntax used for a [[class invariant]]. In the sample below, the loop invariant expression &lt;code&gt;x&amp;nbsp;&lt;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/code&gt; must be true following the loop initialization, and after each execution of the loop body; this is checked at runtime.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;    from
        x := 0
    invariant
        x &lt;= 10
    until
        x &gt; 10
    loop
        x := x + 1
    end&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Whiley===
The [[Whiley (programming language)|Whiley]] programming language also provides first-class support for loop invariants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Designing a Verifying Compiler: Lessons Learned from Developing Whiley | doi=10.1016/j.scico.2015.09.006 | volume=113 | journal=Science of Computer Programming | pages=191–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loop invariants are expressed using one or more &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, as the following illustrates:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="whiley"&gt;
function max(int[] items) -&gt; (int r)
// Requires at least one element to compute max
requires |items| &gt; 0
// (1) Result is not smaller than any element
ensures all { i in 0..|items| | items[i] &lt;= r }
// (2) Result matches at least one element
ensures some { i in 0..|items| | items[i] == r }:
    //
    nat i = 1
    int m = items[0]
    //
    while i &lt; |items|
    // (1) No item seen so far is larger than m
    where all { k in 0..i | items[k] &lt;= m }
    // (2) One or more items seen so far matches m
    where some { k in 0..i | items[k] == m }:
        if items[i] &gt; m:
            m = items[i]
        i = i + 1
    //
    return m
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; function determines the largest element in an integer array.  For this to be defined, the array must contain at least one element.  The [[postconditions]] of &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; require that the returned value is: (1) not smaller than any element; and, (2) that it matches at least one element.  The loop invariant is defined inductively through two &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, each of which corresponds to a clause in the postcondition.  The fundamental difference is that each clause of the loop invariant identifies the result as being correct up to the current element &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, whilst the postconditions identify the result as being correct for all elements.

==Use of loop invariants==

A loop invariant can serve one of the following purposes:
# purely documentary 
# to be checked within in the code by an assertion call
# to be verified based on the [[Hoare logic|Floyd-Hoare approach]]

For 1., a natural language comment (like &lt;code&gt;// m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]&lt;/code&gt; in the [[#Informal example|above]] example) is sufficient.

For 2., programming language support is required, such as the [[C (programming language)|C]] library [[assert.h]], or the [[#Eiffel|above]]-shown &lt;code&gt;invariant&lt;/code&gt; clause in Eiffel. Often, run-time checking can be switched on (for debugging runs) and off (for production runs) by a compiler or a runtime option.{{citation needed|reason=hope that C's or/and Eiffel assert.h supports that?|date=May 2016}}

For 3., some tools exist to support mathematical proofs, usually based on the [[#Floyd–Hoare logic|above]]-shown Floyd–Hoare rule, that a given loop code in fact satisfies a given (set of) loop invariant(s).

The technique of [[abstract interpretation]] can be used to detect loop invariant of given code automatically. However, this approach is limited to very simple invariants (such as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;=n &amp;&amp; i%2==0&lt;/code&gt;).

==Distinction from loop-invariant code==
{{see|Loop-invariant code motion}}
A loop invariant (loop-invariant ''property'') is to be distinguished from loop-invariant ''code''; note "loop invariant" (noun) versus "loop-invariant" (adjective).
Loop-invariant code consists of statements or expressions that can be moved outside the body of a loop without affecting the semantics of a program; such transformations, called [[loop-invariant code motion]], are performed by some compilers to [[optimizing compiler|optimize]] programs.
A loop-invariant code example (in the [[C programming language]]) is
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    x = y+z;
    a[i] = 6*i + x*x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
where the calculations &lt;code&gt;x = y+z&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x*x&lt;/code&gt; can be moved before the loop, resulting in an equivalent, but faster, program:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x = y+z;
t1 = x*x;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    a[i] = 6*i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In contrast, e.g. the property &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; is a loop invariant for both the original and the optimized program, but is not part of the code, hence it doesn't make sense to speak of "moving it out of the loop".

Loop-invariant code may induce a corresponding loop-invariant property.{{clarify|reason=I guess, once the notion of 'loop-invariant code' is defined in a sufficiently formal way, it can be proven that loop-invariant code *always* induces a corresponding loop invariant property.|date=March 2016}} For the above example, the easiest way to see it is to consider a program where the loop invariant code is computed both before and within the loop:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x1 = y+z;
t1 = x1*x1;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    x2 = y+z;
    a[i] = 6*i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
A loop-invariant property of this code is &lt;code&gt;(x1==x2 &amp;&amp; t1==x2*x2) || i==0&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the values computed before the loop agree with those computed within (except before the first iteration).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Mysticism''' is the practice of [[religious ecstasy|religious ecstasies]] (religious experiences during [[Altered state of consciousness|alternate states of consciousness]]), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

The term "mysticism" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word μυω, meaning "to conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} mysticism referred to the biblical liturgical, spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval [[Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} During the [[early modern period]], the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to "extraordinary experiences and states of mind".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}}

In modern times, "mysticism" has acquired a limited definition, with broad applications, as meaning the aim at the "union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God".&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; This limited definition has been applied to a wide range of religious traditions and practices,&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; valuing "mystical experience" as a key element of mysticism.

Broadly defined, mysticism can be found in all [[Religion#Types and demographics|religious traditions]], from [[indigenous religions]] and [[folk religions]] like shamanism, to organised religions like the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] faiths and [[Indian religions]], and modern spirituality, New Age and New Religious Movements.

Since the 1960s scholars have debated the merits of [[perennial philosophy|perennial]] and [[social constructionism|constructionist]] approaches in the scientific research of "mystical experiences".{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The perennial position is now "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} most scholars using a contextual approach, which takes the cultural and historical context into consideration.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Christian contemplation|Henosis}}

"Mysticism" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|μυω}}, meaning "I conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and its derivative {{lang|grc|μυστικός}}, ''[[Wikt:μυστικός|mystikos]]'', meaning 'an initiate'. The verb {{lang|el|μυώ}} has received a quite different meaning in the Greek language, where it is still in use. The primary meanings it has are "induct" and "initiate". Secondary meanings include "introduce", "make someone aware of something", "train", "familiarize", "give first experience of something".&lt;ref group=web name="WordReference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordreference.com/gren/μυώ |title=μυώ |author=|date= |website=WordReference English-Greek Dictionary |publisher=WordReference.com |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related form of the verb {{lang|el|μυέω}} (mueó or myéō) appears in the [[New Testament]]. As explained in ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', it properly means shutting the eyes and mouth to experience mystery. Its figurative meaning is to be initiated into the "mystery revelation". The meaning derives from the initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3453.htm |title=3453. mueó |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also appearing in the New Testament is the related noun {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} (mustérion or mystḗrion), the root word of the English term "mystery".  The term means "anything hidden", a mystery or secret, of which initiation is necessary. In the New Testament it reportedly takes the meaning of the counsels of God, once hidden but now revealed in the Gospel or some fact thereof, the Christian revelation generally, and/or particular truths or details of the Christian revelation.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thayer's Greek Lexicon, the  term {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} in classical Greek meant "a hidden thing", "secret". A particular meaning it took in [[Classical antiquity]] was a religious secret or religious secrets, confided only to the initiated and not to be communicated by them to ordinary mortals. In the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament the meaning it took was that of a hidden purpose or counsel, a secret will. It is sometimes used for the hidden wills of humans, but is more often used for the hidden will of God. Elsewhere in the Bible it takes the meaning of  the mystic or hidden sense of things. It is used for the secrets behind sayings, names, or behind images seen in visions and dreams. The [[Vulgate]] often translates the Greek term to the Latin {{lang|la|sacramentum}} ([[sacrament]]).&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related noun {{lang|el|μύστης}}  (mustis or mystis, singular) means the initiate, the person initiated to the mysteries.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ana Jiménez San Cristobal in her study of [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], the singular form {{lang|el|μύστης}} and the plural form {{lang|el|μύσται}} are used in ancient Greek texts to mean the person or persons initiated to religious mysteries. These followers of mystery religions belonged to a select group, where access was only gained through an initiation. She finds that the terms were associated with the term {{lang|el|βάκχος}} ([[Dionysus|Bacchus]]), which was used for a special class of initiates of the Orphic mysteries. The terms are first found connected in the writings of [[Heraclitus]]. Such initiates are identified in texts with the persons who have been purified and have performed certain rites. A passage of the ''[[Cretans (Euripides)|Cretans]]'' by [[Euripides]] seems to explain that the {{lang|el|μύστης}} (initiate) who devotes himself to an ascetic life, renounces sexual activities, and avoids contact with the dead becomes known as {{lang|el|βάκχος}}. Such initiates were believers in the god Dionysus Bacchus who took on the name of their god and sought an identification with their deity.&lt;ref name="San Cristobal"&gt;San Cristobal (2009), p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term ''[[contemplatio]]'', c.q. ''[[theoria]]''.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} According to Johnson, "[b]oth contemplation and mysticism speak of the eye of love which is looking at, gazing at, aware of divine realities."{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}}

==Definitions==
According to Peter Moore, the term "mysticism" is "problematic but indispensable."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} It is a generic term which joins together into one concept separate practices and ideas which developed separately,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} According to Dupré, "mysticism" has been defined in many ways,{{sfn|Dupré|2005}} and Merkur notes that the definition, or meaning, of the term "mysticism" has changed through the ages.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Moore further notes that the term "mysticism" has become a popular label for "anything nebulous, esoteric, occult, or supernatural."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

Parsons warns that "what might at times seem to be a straightforward phenomenon exhibiting an unambiguous commonality has become, at least within the academic study of religion, opaque and controversial on multiple levels".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Because of its Christian overtones, and the lack of similar terms in other cultures, some scholars regard the term "mysticism" to be inadequate as a useful descriptive term.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} Other scholars regard the term to be an inauthentic fabrication,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; the "product of post-Enlightenment universalism."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

===Union with the Divine or Absolute and mystical experience===
{{See also|Hesychasm|Contemplative prayer|Apophatic theology}}

Deriving from [[Neo-Platonism]] and [[Henosis]], mysticism is popularly known as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} In the 13th century the term ''unio mystica'' came to be used to refer to the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; In the 19th century, under the influence of Romanticism, this "union" was interpreted as a "religious experience," which provides certainty about God or a transcendental reality.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Note that Parmenides' "way of truth" may also be translated as "way of conviction." [[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. Cook's translation "way of conviction" is rendered by other translators as "way of truth."}}

An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} William James popularized this use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Religious experiences belonged to the "personal religion,"{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} He gave a Perennialist interpretation to religious experience, stating that this kind of experience is ultimately uniform in various traditions.{{refn|group=note|William James: "This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think, and which bring it about that the mystical classics have, as been said, neither birthday nor native land."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}}}}

McGinn notes that the term ''unio mystica'', although it has Christian origins, is primarily a modern expression.{{sfn|McGinn|2005|p=6334}} McGinn argues that "presence" is more accurate than "union", since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union. He also argues that we should speak of "consciousness" of God's presence, rather than of "experience", since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about "new ways of knowing and loving based on states of awareness in which God becomes present in our inner acts."{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}

However, the idea of "union" does not work in all contexts. For example, in Advaita Vedanta, there is only one reality (Brahman) and therefore nothing other than reality to unite with it—Brahman in each person (''atman'') has always in fact been identical to Brahman all along. Dan Merkur also notes that union with God or the Absolute is a too limited definition, since there are also traditions which aim not at a sense of unity, but of [[Kenosis|nothingness]], such as [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Meister Eckhart]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; According to Merkur, [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and Buddhism also emphasize [[Sunyata|nothingness]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Blakemore and Jennett note that "definitions of mysticism [...] are often imprecise." They further note that this kind of interpretation and definition is a recent development which has become the standard definition and understanding.&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Blakemore and Jennett: "Mysticism is frequently defined as an experience of direct communion with God, or union with the Absolute, but definitions of mysticism (a relatively modern term) are often imprecise and usually rely on the presuppositions of the modern study of mysticism — namely, that mystical experiences involve a set of intense and usually individual and private psychological states [...] Furthermore, mysticism is a phenomenon said to be found in all major religious traditions.&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/mysticism.aspx#3 Colin Blakemore and Shelia Jennett (2001), ''The Oxford Companion to the Body'']&lt;/ref&gt; Blakemore and Jennett add: "[T]he common assumption that all mystical experiences, whatever their context, are the same cannot, of course, be demonstrated." They also state: "Some have placed a particular emphasis on certain altered states, such as visions, trances, levitations, locutions, raptures, and ecstasies, many of which are altered bodily states. Margery Kempe's tears and [[Teresa of Avila]]'s ecstasies are famous examples of such mystical phenomena. But many mystics have insisted that while these experiences may be a part of the mystical state, they are not the essence of mystical experience, and some, such as Origen, Meister Eckhart, and John of the Cross, have been hostile to such psycho-physical phenomena. Rather, the essence of the mystical experience is the encounter between God and the human being, the Creator and creature; this is a union which leads the human being to an ‘absorption’ or loss of individual personality. It is a movement of the heart, as the individual seeks to surrender itself to ultimate Reality; it is thus about being rather than knowing. For some mystics, such as Teresa of Avila, phenomena such as visions, locutions, raptures, and so forth are by-products of, or accessories to, the full mystical experience, which the soul may not yet be strong enough to receive. Hence these altered states are seen to occur in those at an early stage in their spiritual lives, although ultimately only those who are called to achieve full union with God will do so."&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body" /&gt;}}

According to Gelman, "A unitive experience involves a phenomenological de-emphasis, blurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive significance of the experience is deemed to lie precisely in that phenomenological feature".{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gelman: "Examples are experiences of the oneness of all of nature, “union” with God, as in Christian mysticism, (see section 2.2.1), the Hindu experience that [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]] (that the self/soul is identical with the eternal, absolute being), the Buddhist unconstructed experience, and “monistic” experiences, devoid of all multiplicity."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare [[Plotinus]], who argued that ''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul," initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}}}}

===Religious ecstasies and interpretative context===
{{Main article|Religious ecstasy|Altered state of consciousness|Cognitive science of religion|Neurotheology|Attribution (psychology)}}

Mysticism involves an explanatory context, which provides meaning for so-called mystical and visionary experiences, and related experiences like trances. According to Dan Merkur, mysticism may relate to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness, and the ideas and explanations related to them.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Merkur: "Mysticism is the practice of religious ecstasies (religious experiences during alternate states of consciousness), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;}} Parsons stresses the importance of distinguishing between temporary experiences and mysticism as a process, which is embodied within a "religious matrix" of texts and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}{{refn|group=note|Parsons: "...episodic experience and mysticism as a ''process'' that, though surely punctuated by moments of visionary, unitive, and transformative encounters, is ultimately inseparable from its embodied relation to a total religious matrix: liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals, practice and the arts.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}}} Richard Jones does the same.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 1}} Peter Moore notes that mystical experience may also happen in a spontaneous and natural way, to people who are not committed to any religious tradition. These experiences are not necessarily interpreted in a religious framework.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356}} [[Ann Taves]] asks by which processes experiences are set apart and deemed religious or mystical.{{sfn|Taves|2009}}

===Intuitive insight and enlightenment===
{{Main article|Enlightenment (spiritual)|Divine illumination|Subitism}}

Some authors emphasize that mystical experience involves intuitive understanding of the meaning of existence and of hidden truths, and the resolution of life problems. According to Larson, "mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}{{refn|group=note|Larson: "A mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence – an intuitive understanding and realization which is intense, integrating, self-authenticating, liberating – i.e., providing a sense of release from ordinary self-awareness – and subsequently determinative – i.e., a primary criterion – for interpreting all other experience whether cognitive, conative, or affective."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}}} According to McClenon, mysticism is "the doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|McClenon: "The doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths. Although it is difficult to differentiate which forms of experience allow such understandings, mental episodes supporting belief in "other kinds of reality" are often labeled mystical [...] Mysticism tends to refer to experiences supporting belief in a cosmic unity rather than the advocation of a particular religious ideology."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford"&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Mysticism.htm James McClenon, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopedia of Religion and Society]&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to James R. Horne, mystical illumination "a central visionary experience [...] that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Horne: "[M]ystical illumination is interpreted as a central visionary experience in a psychological and behavioural process that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem. This factual, minimal interpretation depicts mysticism as an extreme and intense form of the insight seeking process that goes in activities such as solving theoretical problems or developing new inventions.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}}}

According to Evelyn Underhill, ''illumination''  is a generic English term for the phenomenon of mysticism. The term ''illumination'' is derived from the Latin ''[[Wikt:illuminatio|illuminatio]]'', applied to Christian [[prayer]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Underhill|2008}} Comparable Asian terms are [[bodhi]], [[kensho]] and [[satori]] in [[Buddhism]], commonly translated as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], and [[vipassana]], which all point to cognitive processes of intuition and comprehension. According to Wright, the use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world, and there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=181–183}}

===Spiritual life and re-formation===
{{Main article|Spirituality|Spiritual development|Self-realization|Ego death}}

Other authors point out that mysticism involves more than "mystical experience." According to Gellmann, the ultimate goal of mysticism is human transformation, not just experiencing mystical or visionary states.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gellman: "Typically, mystics, theistic or not, see their mystical experience as part of a larger undertaking aimed at human transformation (See, for example, Teresa of Avila, Life, Chapter 19) and not as the terminus of their efforts. Thus, in general, ‘mysticism’ would best be thought of as a constellation of distinctive practices, discourses, texts, institutions, traditions, and experiences aimed at human transformation, variously defined in different traditions."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} According to [[Evelyn Underhill]], mysticism is "the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}{{refn|group=note|Original quote in "Evelyn Underhill (1930), ''Mysticism: A Study in the Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness''.{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}{{refn|group=note|Underhill: "One of the most abused words in the English language, it has been used in different and often mutually exclusive senses by religion, poetry, and philosophy: has been claimed as an excuse for every kind of [[occultism]], for dilute [[transcendentalism]], vapid [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], religious or aesthetic sentimentality, and bad [[metaphysics]]. on the other hand, it has been freely employed as a term of contempt by those who have criticized these things.

Waaijman points out that "spirituality" is only one term of a range of words which denote the praxis of spirituality.{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}} Some other terms are "Hasidism, contemplation, kabbala, asceticism, mysticism, perfection, devotion and piety".{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}}}} According to McGinn, personal transformation is the essential criterion to determine the authenticity of Christian mysticism.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}{{refn|group=note|McGinn: "This is why the only test that Christianity has known for determining the authenticity of a mystic and her or his message has been that of personal transformation, both on the mystic's part and—especially—on the part of those whom the mystic has affected.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}}}

==History of the term==
===Hellenistic world===
In the Hellenistic world, 'mystical' referred to "secret" religious rituals{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} The use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} A "mystikos" was an initiate of a mystery religion.

===Early Christianity===
{{Main article|Greco-Roman mysteries|Early Christianity|Esoteric Christianity}}

In early Christianity the term "mystikos" referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The biblical dimension refers to "hidden" or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ at the Eucharist.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}}

Until the sixth century, the Greek term ''theoria,'' meaning "contemplation" in Latin, was used for the mystical interpretation of the Bible.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early [[Church Fathers]], who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology".

''Theoria'' enabled the Fathers to perceive depths of meaning in the biblical writings that escape a purely scientific or empirical approach to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6r7lQ6np94YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=breck+bible+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s4rJTJCkDs2eOpDmpLcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inspired%20vision&amp;f=false John Breck, ''Scripture in Tradition: The Bible and Its Interpretation in the Orthodox Church''], St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Antiochene Fathers, in particular, saw in every passage of Scripture a double meaning, both literal and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6r7lQ6np94YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=breck+bible+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s4rJTJCkDs2eOpDmpLcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=double%20meaning&amp;f=false Breck, ''Scripture in Tradition''], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, ''theoria'' or contemplation came to be distinguished from intellectual life, leading to the identification of θεωρία or ''contemplatio'' with a [[contemplative prayer|form of prayer]]&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; distinguished from discursive meditation in both East&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CpPnSHWu5d8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Matt%C3%A1+al-Misk%C4%ABn+%22return+of+adam%22&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Mattá al-Miskīn, ''Orthodox Prayer Life: The Interior Way'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2003] {{ISBN|0-88141-250-3}}), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; and West.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Contemplation |title=Augustin Poulain, "Contemplation", in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1908 |access-date=2011-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113160224/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Contemplation |archive-date=2012-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval meaning===
{{See also|Middle Ages}}

This threefold meaning of "mystical" continued in the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} According to Dan Merkur, the term ''unio mystica'' came into use in the 13th century as a synonym for the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, although it was mostly a male religiosity, since women were not allowed to study.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology". It is best known nowadays in the western world from [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[John of the Cross]].

===Early modern meaning===
{{See also|Early modern period}}
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 166.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25| ''The Appearance of the Holy Spirit before Saint Teresa of Ávila,'' [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
In the sixteenth and seventeenth century ''mysticism'' came to be used as a substantive.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} This shift was linked to a new discourse,{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} in which science and religion were separated.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–18}}

[[Martin Luther|Luther]] dismissed the allegorical interpretation of the bible, and condemned Mystical theology, which he saw as more Platonic than Christian.{{sfn|King|2002|p=16}} "The mystical", as the search for the hidden meaning of texts, became secularised, and also associated with literature, as opposed to science and prose.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–17}}

Science was also distinguished from religion. By the middle of the 17th century, "the mystical" is increasingly applied exclusively to the religious realm, separating religion and "natural philosophy" as two distinct approaches to the discovery of the hidden meaning of the universe.{{sfn|King|2002|p=17}} The traditional hagiographies and writings of the saints became designated as "mystical", shifting from the virtues and miracles to extraordinary experiences and states of mind, thereby creating a newly coined "mystical tradition".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}} A new understanding developed of the Divine as residing within human, an essence beyond the varieties of religious expressions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}}

===Contemporary meaning===
{{See also|Western esotericism|Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Syncretism|Spirituality|New Age}}

The 19th century saw a growing emphasis on individual experience, as a defense against the growing rationalism of western society.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; The meaning of mysticism was considerably narrowed:&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/400861/mysticism Dan Merkur, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The competition between the perspectives of theology and science resulted in a compromise in which most varieties of what had traditionally been called mysticism were dismissed as merely psychological phenomena and only one variety, which aimed at union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God—and thereby the perception of its essential unity or oneness—was claimed to be genuinely mystical. The historical evidence, however, does not support such a narrow conception of mysticism.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;}}

Under the influence of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], which was popularised in both the west and the east by [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalists]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], mysticism has been applied to a broad spectrum of religious traditions, in which all sorts of [[esotericism]] and religious traditions and practices are joined together.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term mysticism was extended to comparable phenomena in non-Christian religions,&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; where it influenced Hindu and Buddhist responses to colonialism, resulting in [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|McMahan|2010}}

In the contemporary usage "mysticism" has become an umbrella term for all sorts of non-rational world views.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3-5}} William Harmless even states that mysticism has become "a catch-all for religious weirdness".{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=3}} Within the academic study of religion the apparent "unambiguous commonality" has become "opaque and controversial".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} The term "mysticism" is being used in different ways in different traditions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Some call to attention the conflation of mysticism and linked terms, such as spirituality and esotericism, and point at the [[Différance|differences]] between various traditions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=3–4}}

==Variations of mysticism==
Based on various definitions of mysticism, namely mysticism as an experience of union or nothingness, mysticism as any kind of an altered state of consciousness which is attributed in a religious way, mysticism as "enlightenment" or insight, and mysticism as a way of transformation, "mysticism" can be found in many cultures and religious traditions, both in [[folk religion]] and [[organized religion]]. These traditions include practices to induce religious or mystical experiences, but also ethical standards and practices to enhance self-control and integrate the mystical experience into daily life.

Dan Merkur notes, though, that mystical practices are often separated from daily religious practices, and restricted to "religious specialists like monastics, priests, and other renunciates.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;

===Shamanism===
[[File:Khagdaev1.JPG|frameless|left|upright=0.9|Shaman]]
{{Main article|Shamanism}}

According to Dan Merkur, shamanism may be regarded as a form of mysticism, in which the world of spirits is accessed through [[religious ecstasy]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; According to [[Mircea Eliade]] shamanism is a "technique of [[religious ecstasy]]."&lt;ref name = Eli72&gt;Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamanism  is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop87|Hoppál 1987]].  p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance|trance state]] during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "shamanism" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]], as well as those of the neighboring [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]-speaking peoples. The term is also used to describe similar magico-religious practices found within the [[ethnic religion]]s of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. For instance, [[Louisiana Voodoo]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[West African Vodun]], [[Dominican Vudú]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] are related{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} folk-religions with ecstatic elements.

[[Neoshamanism]] refers to  "new"' forms of  [[shamanism]], or methods of seeking visions or  healing, typically practiced in Western countries. Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world, and is associated with [[New Age]] practices.&lt;ref name="Harner1"&gt;Harner, Michael ''The Way of the Shaman.'' 1980, new edition, HarperSanFrancisco, 1990, {{ISBN|0-06-250373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/article/the-new-age-embraces-shamanism/ The New Age embaraces Shamanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mystery religions====
{{Main article|Greco-Roman mysteries}}

The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], (Greek: [[Wikt:Ἐλευσίς|Ἐλευσίνια]] [[Wikt:Μυστήρια|Μυστήρια]]) were annual initiation ceremonies in the cults of the goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]], held in secret at Eleusis (near [[Athens]]) in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerényi, Karoly, "Kore," in C.G.

====Christian mysticism====
{{Christian mysticism}}
{{Main article|Christian contemplation|Christian mysticism|Mystical theology|Apophatic theology|German mysticism}}

=====Early Christianity=====
The [[apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (6th c.) exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, both in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]] and (by Latin translation) in the [[Western Christianity|West]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} Pseudo-Dionysius applied [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] thought, particularly that of [[Proclus]], to Christian theology.

=====Orthodox Christianity=====
The [[Orthodox Church]] has a long tradition of ''[[theoria]]'' (intimate experience) and ''[[hesychasm|hesychia]]'' (inner stillness), in which [[contemplative prayer]] silences the mind to progress along the path of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' (deification).

''Theosis'', practical unity with and conformity to God, is obtained by engaging in [[contemplative prayer]], the first stage of ''theoria'',&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=MHV|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "Noetic prayer is the first stage of theoria."&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"/&gt;}} which results from the cultivation of watchfulness (''[[nepsis]]''). In ''theoria'', one comes to behold the "divisibly indivisible" divine operations (''[[Essence–energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energeia]]'') of God as the "uncreated light" of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], a grace which is eternal and proceeds naturally from the blinding darkness of the incomprehensible divine essence.{{refn|group=note|[[Theophan the Recluse]]: "The contemplative mind sees God, in so far as this is possible for man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophan the Recluse]], ''What Is prayer?''. Cited in ''The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology'', p.73, compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, trans, E. Kadloubovsky and E.M. Palmer, ed. Timothy Ware, 1966, Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "This is what Saint Symeon the New Theologian teaches. In his poems, proclaims over and over that, while beholding the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. Being in "theoria" (vision of God), the saints do not confuse the hypostatic attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing these hypostatic attributes and teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this experience there can be no genuine "therapeutic tradition.""&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"&gt;Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos, [http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/hierotheos_difference.aspx ''The Difference Between Orthodox Spirituality and Other Traditions'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is the main aim of [[hesychasm]], which was developed in the thought St. [[Symeon the New Theologian]], embraced by the monastic communities on [[Mount Athos]], and most notably defended by St. [[Gregory Palamas]] against the Greek [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] philosopher [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam of Calabria]]. According to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] critics, hesychastic practice has its roots to the introduction of a systematic practical approach to [[quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]] by [[Symeon the New Theologian]].{{refn|group=note|Catholic Encyclopedia: "But it was Simeon, "the new theologian" (c. 1025-c. 1092; see Krumbacher, op. cit., 152–154), a monk of Studion, the "greatest mystic of the Greek Church" (loc. cit.), who evolved the [[quietist]] theory so elaborately that he may be called the father of Hesychasm. For the union with God in contemplation (which is the highest object of our life) he required a regular system of spiritual education beginning with baptism and passing through regulated exercises of penance and asceticism under the guidance of a director. But he had not conceived the grossly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] practices of the later Hesychasts; his ideal is still enormously more philosophical than theirs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia online article Hesychasm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience,&lt;ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"&gt;[[#refdeCatanzaro1980|deCatanzaro 1980]], pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and met with strong resistance for his [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God's grace.&lt;ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"/&gt;

=====Western Europe=====
[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil43.jpg|thumb|left|Life of [[Francis of Assisi]] by [[José Benlliure y Gil]] ]]
The [[High Middle Ages]] saw a flourishing of mystical practice and theorization in western Roman Catholicism, corresponding to the flourishing of new monastic orders, with such figures as [[Guigo II]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the [[Victorines]], all coming from different orders, as well as the first real flowering of [[popular piety]] among the laypeople.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] saw the clash between the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] [[school of thought|schools of thought]], which was also a conflict between two different [[mystical theology|mystical theologies]]: on the one hand that of [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzmán]] and on the other that of [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Angela of Foligno]]. This period also saw such individuals as [[John of Ruysbroeck]], [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Catherine of Genoa]], the [[Devotio Moderna]], and such books as the ''[[Theologia Germanica]]'', ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]''.

Moreover, there was the growth of groups of mystics centered around geographic regions: the [[Beguines]], such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] and [[Hadewijch]] (among others); the [[German mysticism|Rhineland mystics]] [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]] and [[Henry Suso]]; and the English mystics [[Richard Rolle]], [[Walter Hilton]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The [[Spanish mystics]] included [[Teresa of Avila]], [[John of the Cross]] and [[Ignatius Loyola]].

The later post-[[reformation]] period also saw the writings of [[layperson|lay]] visionaries such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[William Blake]], and the foundation of mystical movements such as the [[Quaker]]s. Catholic mysticism continued into the modern period with such figures as [[Padre Pio]] and [[Thomas Merton]].

The [[philokalia]], an ancient method of [[Eastern Orthodox]] mysticism, was promoted by the twentieth century [[Traditionalist School]]. The allegedly inspired or "[[Mediumship|channeled]]" work ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' represents a blending of non-denominational Christian and [[New Age]] ideas.

====Western esotericism and modern spirituality====
{{Main article|Western esotericism|Spirituality|New Age}}

Many western esoteric traditions and elements of modern spirituality have been regarded as "mysticism," such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the [[Fourth Way]],{{sfn|Magee|2016}} and [[Neo-Paganism]]. Modern western spiritually and [[transpersonal psychology]] combine western psycho-therapeutic practices with religious practices like meditation to attain a lasting transformation. Nature mysticism is an intense experience of unification with nature or the cosmic totality, which was popular with Romantic writers.{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6342}}

===Jewish mysticism===
{{Jewish mysticism}}
{{Main article|Jewish mysticism|Kabbalah}}

In the common era, Judaism has had two main kinds of mysticism: [[Merkabah mysticism]] and [[Kabbalah]].  The former predated the latter, and was focused on visions, particularly those mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel.  It gets its name from the Hebrew word meaning "chariot", a reference to Ezekiel's vision of a fiery chariot composed of heavenly beings.

Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious [[Ein Sof]] (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation.

Kabbalah originally developed entirely within the realm of [[Jewish thought]]. Kabbalists often use classical Jewish sources to explain and demonstrate its esoteric teachings. These teachings are thus held by followers in [[Judaism]] to define the inner meaning of both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and traditional [[Rabbinic literature]], their formerly concealed [[Oral Torah|transmitted]] dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish [[Halakha|religious observances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380313/jewish/Imbued-with-Holiness.htm "Imbued with Holiness"] – The relationship of the esoteric to the [[exoteric]] in the fourfold [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]] interpretation of Torah and existence. From www.kabbalaonline.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabbalah emerged, after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th to 13th century [[Hachmei Provence|Southern France]] and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]], becoming reinterpreted in the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century [[Safed|Ottoman Palestine]]. It was popularised in the form of [[Hasidic Judaism]] from the 18th century forward. 20th-century interest in Kabbalah has inspired cross-denominational [[Jewish renewal]] and contributed to wider non-Jewish [[New Age|contemporary spirituality]], as well as engaging its [[Gershom Scholem|flourishing emergence]] and historical re-emphasis through newly established [[Jewish studies|academic investigation]].

===Islamic mysticism===
{{Sufism|Persian mysticism}}
{{Main article|Sufism}}

Sufism is said to be Islam's inner and mystical dimension.&lt;ref name="Godlas"&gt;Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, ''Sufism's Many Paths'', 2000, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html University of Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuh Ha Mim Keller, "How would you respond to the claim that Sufism is Bid'a?", 1995.

A practitioner of this tradition is nowadays known as a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūfī}}'' ({{lang|fa|صُوفِيّ}}), or, in earlier usage, a [[dervish]]. The origin of the word "Sufi" is ambiguous. One understanding is that Sufi means wool-wearer; wool wearers during early Islam were pious ascetics who withdrew from urban life. Another explanation of the word "Sufi" is that it means 'purity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seyyedeh Dr. Nahid Angha |url=http://ias.org/sufism/origin-of-word-tasawouf/ |title=origin of the Wrod Tasawouf |publisher=Ias.org |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufis generally belong to a ''[[khalqa]]'', a circle or group, led by a Sheikh or ''[[Murshid]]''. Sufi circles usually belong to a ''[[Tariqa]]'' which is the Sufi order and each has a ''[[Silsila]]'', which is the spiritual lineage, which traces its succession back to notable Sufis of the past, and often ultimately to the last prophet [[Muhammed]] or one of his close associates. The ''turuq'' (plural of ''tariqa'') are not enclosed like Christian monastic orders; rather the members retain an outside life. Membership of a Sufi group often passes down family lines. Meetings may or may not be segregated according to the prevailing custom of the wider society. An existing Muslim faith is not always a requirement for entry, particularly in Western countries.

Sufi practice includes
* ''[[Dhikr]]'', or remembrance (of God), which often takes the form of rhythmic chanting and breathing exercises.
* ''[[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]'', which takes the form of music and dance — the whirling dance of the ''[[Mevlevi]]'' dervishes is a form well known in the West.
* ''[[Muraqaba]]'' or meditation.
* Visiting holy places, particularly the tombs of Sufi saints, in order to remember death and the greatness of those who have passed.

The aims of Sufism include: the experience of ecstatic states (''hal''), purification of the heart (''[[qalb]]''), overcoming the lower self (''[[nafs]]''), extinction of the individual personality (''[[fana (Sufism)|fana]]''), communion with God (''[[haqiqa]]''), and higher knowledge (''[[marifat]]''). Some sufic beliefs and practices have been found unorthodox by other Muslims; for instance [[Mansur al-Hallaj]] was put to death for blasphemy after uttering the phrase ''[[Ana'l Haqq]]'', "I am the Truth" (i.e. God) in a trance.

Notable classical Sufis include [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], [[Fariduddin Attar]], [[Sultan Bahoo]], [[Sayyed Sadique Ali Husaini]], [[Saadi Shirazi]] and [[Hafez]], all major poets in the [[Persian language]]. [[Omar Khayyam]], [[Al-Ghazzali]] and [[Ibn Arabi]] were renowned scholars. [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], [[Moinuddin Chishti]], and [[Bahauddin Naqshband]] founded major orders, as did Rumi. [[Rabia Basri]] was the most prominent female Sufi.

Sufism first came into contact with the Judeo-Christian world during the
[[Moorish]] occupation of [[Spain]]. An interest in Sufism revived in non-Muslim countries during the modern era, led by such figures as [[Inayat Khan]] and [[Idries Shah]] (both in the UK), [[Rene Guenon]] (France) and [[Ivan Aguéli]] (Sweden). Sufism has also long been present in Asian countries that do not have a Muslim majority, such as [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/25/china-xinjiang-sufi-shrines/ Xinjiang Sufi Shrines]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====
{{Main article|Hinduism}}

In Hinduism, various [[sadhana]]s aim at overcoming ignorance (''avidhya'') and transcending the limited identification with body, mind and ego to attain ''[[moksha]]''. Hinduism has a number of interlinked [[Sādhanā|ascetic traditions]] and [[Darsanas|philosophical schools]] which aim at [[moksha]]{{sfn|Raju|1992}} and the acquisition of higher powers.{{sfn|White|2012}} With the onset of the British colonisation of India, those traditions came to be interpreted in western terms such as "mysticism", drawing equivalents with western terms and practices.{{sfn|King|2001}}

[[Yoga]] is the [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], and [[soul|spiritual]] practices or disciplines which aim to attain a state of permanent peace.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=10, 457}} Various traditions of yoga are found in [[Hinduism]], Buddhism and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Denise Lardner Carmody, John Carmody, ''Serene Compassion.'' Oxford University Press US, 1996, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Stuart Ray Sarbacker, ''Samādhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga.''

Classical [[Vedanta]] gives philosophical interpretations and commentaries of the [[Upanishads]], a vast collection of ancient hymns.  At least ten schools of Vedanta are known,{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} of which [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vishishtadvaita]], and [[Dvaita]] are the best known.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}} Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]], states that there is no difference between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. The best-known subschool is Kevala Vedanta or ''mayavada'' as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]]. Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.{{sfn|King|1999}} In contrast [[Bhedabheda]]-Vedanta emphasizes that Atman and Brahman are both the same and ''not'' the same,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} while [[Dvaita]] Vedanta states that Atman and God are fundamentally different.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} In modern times, the Upanishads have been interpreted by [[Neo-Vedanta]] as being "mystical".{{sfn|King|2001}}

Various [[Shaivism|Shaivist]] traditions are strongly nondualistic, such as [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].

====Tantra====
{{Main article|Tantra}}

Tantra is the name given by scholars to a style of meditation and ritual which arose in [[India]] no later than the fifth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Einoo |first=Shingo (ed.) |year=2009 |page=45 |title=Genesis and Development of Tantrism |publisher=University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantra has influenced the [[Hindu]], [[Bön]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Jain]] traditions and [[silk road transmission of Buddhism|spread with Buddhism]] to [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}} Tantric ritual seeks to access the supra-mundane through the mundane, identifying the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] with the [[macrocosm]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric aim is to sublimate (rather than negate) reality.&lt;ref name=nikhilananda&gt;Nikhilanada (1982), pp. 145–160&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric practitioner seeks to use ''[[prana]]'' (energy flowing through the [[universe]], including one's body) to attain goals which may be spiritual, material or both.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Tantric practice includes visualisation of deities, [[mantra]]s and [[mandala]]s. It can also include sexual and other ([[antinomian]]) practices.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Sant-tradition and Sikhism====
{{Main article|Sant (religion)|Nirguna Brahman|Sikhism}}

[[File:Miniature of Guru Nanak from Astronomical treatise.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Guru Nanak]] and [[Bhai Mardana]]]]
Mysticism in the [[Sikh]] [[dharma|dharm]] began with its founder, [[Guru Nanak]], who as a child had profound mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalra|first=Surjit|title=Stories Of Guru Nanak|year=2004|publisher=Pitambar Publishing|isbn=9788120912755}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guru Nanak stressed that God must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lebron|first=Robyn|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...can There be Common Ground?: A Basic Internet Guide to Forty World Religions &amp; Spiritual Practices|year=2012|publisher=CrossBooks|isbn=9781462712618|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Arjan]], the fifth [[Sikh Guru]], added religious [[bhagat|mystics]] belonging to other religions into the [[Adi Granth|holy scriptures]] that would eventually become the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Presectarian Buddhism|Buddhist meditation|Subitism}}

According to Oliver, Buddhism is mystical in the sense that it aims at the identification of the true nature of our self, and live according to it.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, P. ''Mysticism: A Guide for the Perplexed, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism originated in India, sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries [[Common Era|BCE]], but is now mostly practiced in other countries, where it developed into a number of traditions, the main ones being [[Therevada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]].

Buddhism aims at [[Moksha|liberation]] from the cycle of rebirth by self-control through meditation and morally just behaviour. Some [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Buddhist paths]] aim at a gradual development and transformation of the personality toward [[Nirvana]], like the Theravada [[Four stages of enlightenment|stages of enlightenment]]. Others, like the Japanese Rinzai Zen tradition, emphasize [[Subitism|sudden insight]], but nevertheless also prescribe intensive training, including meditation and self-restraint.

Although [[Theravada]] does not acknowledge the existence of a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as a transcendent reality which may be attained.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}}{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=7}} It further stresses transformation of the personality through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}} According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened.{{sfn|Jones|2016| p=12 }} It is best known in the west from the [[Vipassana movement]], a number of branches of modern [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism from [[Buddhism in Burma|Burma]], [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]] and [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], and includes contemporary [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist teachers]] such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] and [[Jack Kornfield]].

Both denoye the potentiality of attaining Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lankavatara-interpretation, ''tathagata-garbha'' as a potentiality turned into a metaphysical Absolute reality which had to be realised.}} ''Vijñapti-mātra'', coupled with ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' or ''tathagatagarba'', has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

Chinese and Japanese Zen is grounded on the Chinese understanding of the [[Buddha-nature]] as one true's essence, and the [[Two truths doctrine]] as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or [[Buddha-nature]], thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=168}} In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and [[shikan-taza]], sitting meditation, is the expression of the already existing Buddhahood.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a [[Kensho|break-through insight]] in this Buddha-nature,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life,{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|p=54, 140}} as expressed in the [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]].{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} The Japanese Zen-scholar [[D.T.

Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28586-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan [[Vajrayana]] tradition is based on Madhyamaka philosophy and Tantra.{{sfn|Newman|2001|p=587}} In deity yoga, visualizations of deities are eventually dissolved, to realize the inherent [[sunyata|emptiness]] of every-'thing' that exists.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=16–20}} [[Dzogchen]], which is being taught in both the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan buddhist]] [[Nyingma]] school and the [[Bön]] tradition,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dzogchen Rigpa Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on direct insight into our real nature. It holds that "mind-nature" is manifested when one is enlightened,{{sfn|Klein|Tenzin Wangyal|2006|p=4}} being nonconceptually aware (''[[rigpa]]'', "open presence") of one's nature,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}} "a recognition of one's beginningless nature."{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=272}} [[Mahamudra]] has similarities with Dzogchen, emphasizing the meditational approach to insight and liberation.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}

Taoist philosophy is centered on the ''Tao'', usually translated "Way", an ineffable cosmic principle. The contrasting yet interdependent concepts of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]'' and ''[[yin and yang|yang]]'' also symbolise harmony, with Taoist scriptures often emphasing the ''Yin'' virtues of femininity, passivity and yieldingness.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysticism: A guide for the Perplexed''. Oliver, P.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist practice includes exercises and rituals aimed at manipulating the life force ''[[Qi]]'', and obtaining health and longevity.{{refn|group=note|Extending to physical immortality: the Taoist pantheon includes ''[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]'', or immortals.}} These have been elaborated into practices such as ''[[Tai chi]]'', which are well known in the west.

===The Secularization of Mysticism===
{{see also|New Age}}

Today there is also occurring in the West what Richard Jones calls "the secularization of mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Jones, ''Philosophy of Mysticism'' (SUNY Press, 2016), epilogue.&lt;/ref&gt; That is the separation of meditation and other mystical practices from their traditional use in religious ways of life to only secular ends of purported psychological and physiological benefits.

==Scholarly approaches of mysticism and mystical experience==
{{Main article|Scholarly approaches of mysticism}}

===Types of mysticism===
[[R. C. Zaehner]] distinguishes three fundamental types of mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The monistic type, which according to Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul,{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the work of [[C.G. Jung]].}} includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as [[Samhya]] and [[Advaita vedanta]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into one of these two categories.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}

[[Walter Terence Stace]], in his book ''Mysticism and Philosophy'' (1960), distinguished two types of mystical experience, namely extrovertive and introvertive mysticism.{{sfn|Stace|1960|p=chap. 1}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} Extrovertive mysticism is an experience of the unity of the external world, whereas introvertive mysticism is "an experience of unity devoid of perceptual objects; it is literally an experience of 'no-thing-ness'."{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} The unity in extrovertive mysticism is with the totality of objects of perception. While perception stays continuous, “unity shines through the same world”; the unity in introvertive mysticism is with a pure consciousness, devoid of objects of perception,{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=292}} “pure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-451-60306-0|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stace such experiences are nonsensous and nonintellectual, under a total “suppression of the whole empirical content.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn= 0-451-60306-0|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace argues that doctrinal differences between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Stace argues that mysticism is part of the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.&lt;ref name="Mysticism and Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=Mysticism and Philosophy|date=1960|publisher=MacMillan|pages=44–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mystical experiences===
Since the 19th century, '''mystical experience''' has evolved as a distinctive concept. It is closely related to "mysticism" but lays sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior, whereas mysticism encompasses a broad range of practices aiming at a transformation of the person, not just inducing mystical experiences.

[[William James]]' ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is the classic study on religious or mystical experience, which influenced deeply both the academic and popular understanding of "religious experience".{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} He popularized the use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his "Varieties",{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental:{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}
{{quote|Under the influence of William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience, heavily centered on people's conversion experiences, most philosophers' interest in mysticism has been in distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting "mystical experiences.""{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}}}

Yet, Gelman notes that so-called mystical experience is not a transitional event, as William James claimed, but an "abiding consciousness, accompanying a person throughout the day, or parts of it. For that reason, it might be better to speak of mystical consciousness, which can be either fleeting or abiding."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

Most mystical traditions warn against an attachment to mystical experiences, and offer a "protective and hermeneutic framework" to accommodate these experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} These same traditions offer the means to induce mystical experiences,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} which may have several origins:
* Spontaneous; either apparently without any cause, or by persistent existential concerns, or by neurophysiological origins;
* Religious practices, such as [[contemplation]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]]-repetition;
* Entheogens (psychedelic drugs)
* Neurophysiological origins, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

The theoretical study of mystical experience has shifted from an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, takes into account the historical and cultural context.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.

===Perennialism versus constructionism===
The term "mystical experience" evolved as a distinctive concept since the 19th century, laying sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior. Perennialists regard those various experience traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof. In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the context in which they emerge.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Well-known representatives are William James, R.C. Zaehner, William Stace and Robert Forman.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity."{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}}

In contrast, for the past decades most scholars have favored a constructionist approach, which states that mystical experiences are fully constructed by the ideas, symbols and practices that mystics are familiar with.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} Critics of the term "religious experience" note that the notion of "religious experience" or "mystical experience" as marking insight into religious truth is a modern development,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} and contemporary researchers of mysticism note that mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts "which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience".{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic.{{sfn|Katz|2000|pp=3–4}}

Richard Jones draws a distinction between "anticonstructivism" and "perennialism": constructivism can be rejected with respect to a certain class of mystical experiences without ascribing to a perennialist philosophy on the relation of mystical doctrines.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 2; also see Jensine Andresen, "Introduction: Towards  a Cognitive Science of Religion," in Jensine Andresen, ed., ''Religion in Mind''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.}} One can reject constructivism without claiming that mystical experiences reveal a cross-cultural "perennial truth". For example, a Christian can reject both constructivism and perennialism in arguing that there is a union with God free of cultural construction. Constructivism versus anticonstructivism is a matter of the nature of ''mystical experiences'' while perennialism is a matter of ''mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse''.

===Contextualism and attribution theory===
{{Main article|Attribution (psychology)|Neurotheology}}

The contextual approach has become the common approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Contextualism takes into account the historical and cultural context of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The attribution approach views "mystical experience" as non-ordinary states of consciousness which are explained in a religious framework.{{sfn|Taves|2009}} According to Proudfoot, mystics unconsciously merely attribute a doctrinal content to ordinary experiences. That is, mystics project cognitive content onto otherwise ordinary experiences having a strong emotional impact.{{sfn|Proudfoot|1985}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}} This approach has been further elaborated by [[Ann Taves]], in her ''[[Religious Experience Reconsidered]]''. She incorporates both [[Neurotheology|neurological]] and cultural approaches in the study of mystical experience.

===Neurological research===
{{See also|Neurotheology}}

Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.{{sfn|Newberg|d'Aquili|2008}}{{sfn|Newberg|Waldman|2009}} This leads to a central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural correlates of mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences are no more than brain events or does it merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 4}}

Interest in mystical experiences and psychedelic drugs has also recently seen a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{Harvnb|Richards|2015}}; {{Harvnb|Osto|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temporal lobe]] seems to be involved in mystical experiences,&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 14 November 2015 | url = http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | title = The Neurophysiology of the Brain: Its Relationship to Altered States of Consciousness (With emphasis on the Mystical Experience) | author = Peter Fenwick | year = 1980 | publisher = Wrekin Trust | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160214151842/http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | archive-date = 14 February 2016 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Picard|2013}} and in the change in personality that may result from such experiences.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; It generates the feeling of "I," and gives a feeling of familiarity or strangeness to the perceptions of the senses.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; There is a long-standing notion that epilepsy and religion are linked,{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}} and [[List of people with epilepsy#Religious figures|some religious figures]] may have had [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt;{{sfn|Bryant|1953}}{{sfn|Leuba|1925}}{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}}

The [[anterior insula]] may be involved in [[ineffability]], a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words, which is a common quality in mystical experiences. According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the [[anterior insula]], a part of the brain which is involved in [[interoception]], self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk".{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2496–2498}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/can-epilepsy-unlock-the-secret-to-happiness-/epilepsy-happiness-brain-fabienne-picard/c4s13429/ Francesca Sacco (2013-09-19), ''Can Epilepsy Unlock The Secret To Happiness?'', Le Temps]}}

===Mysticism and morality===
A philosophical issue in the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to [[morality]]. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Stace 1960, pp. 323–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is not as simple as that.{{sfn|Barnard|Kripal|2002}}{{sfn|Jones|2004}}

Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism – that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences – serves to exclude it from political issues as social justice. Mysticism thus becomes seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than seeking to transform the world, serve to accommodate the individual to the status quo through the alleviation of anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4454">'''Neighbourhoods Green''' is an English partnership initiative which works with [[Public housing|social landlords]] and [[housing associations]] to highlight the importance of open and [[Urban open space|green space]] for residents and raise the overall quality of design and management with these groups.

==History and governance==
The partnership was established in 2003 when [[Peabody Trust]] and Notting Hill Housing Group held a conference which identified the need to raise the profile of the green and open spaces owned and managed by social landlords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zurich.co.uk/municipal/yoursector/socialhousing/neighbourhoodsgreen.htm Neighbourhoods Green], ''Zurich Municipal Website''.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme attracted praise from the then [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for parks and green spaces [[Yvette Cooper]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcplus.com/lgc-news/minister-applauds-neighbourhoods-green/1276728.article Minister Applauds Neighbourhoods Green], ''Local Government Chronicle'', 4 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 the partnership has expanded to include [[National Housing Federation]], [[Groundwork UK|Groundwork]], [[The Wildlife Trusts]], [[Landscape Institute]], [[Green Flag Award]], [[Royal Horticultural Society]], [[Natural England]] and [[CABE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/enjoying/linkingpeople/communities/neighbourhoodsgreen/default.aspx Neighbourhoods Green Partners], ''Natural England Website''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is overseen by a steering group which includes representatives from [[Circle Housing Group]], Great Places Housing Group, Helena Homes, [[London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham]], Medina Housing, New Charter Housing Trust, Notting Hill Housing, Peabody Trust, [[Places for People]], Regenda Group and Wakefield &amp; District Housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/partners Neighbourhoods Green Partners], ''Neighbourhoods Green Website''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Neighbourhoods Green has three main areas of emphasis. It produces [[best practice]] guidance, highlighting the contribution parks, gardens and play areas make to the quality of life for residents – including the [[mitigation of climate change]], promotion of [[biodiversity]] and aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/news/index.php/news_articles/view/residential_green_space_boosts_community_cohesion/ Residential green space boosts community cohesion], ''Landscape Institute News and Events'' 24 Nov 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also generates a number of case studies from housing associations and community groups and offers training for landlords, residents and partners on areas such as playspace, green infrastructure and growing food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/training Training and Events], ''Neighbourhoods Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, working in conjunction with [[University of Sheffield]] and the National Housing Federation, Neighbourhoods Green produced ''Greener Neighbourhoods'' a best practice guide to managing green space for social housing. Its ten principles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/upload/public/documents/webpage/Greener-neighbourhoods-weblinks-2110.pdf Greener Neighbourhoods : A Good Practice Guide to Managing Green Space], ''Neighbourhoods Green'' 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  for housing green space were:
* Commit to quality
* Involve residents
* Know the bigger picture
* Make the best use of funding
* Design for local people
* Develop training and skills	
* Maintain high standards
* Make places feel safe	
* Promote healthy living
* Prepare for climate change		

During 2013/14 Neighbourhoods Green will be working with [[Keep Britain Tidy]] to support the expansion of the Green Flag Award into the social housing sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/about/gfa Green Flag Award], ''Neighbourhoods Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4850">'''Nesin Mathematics Village''', named after [[Aziz Nesin]], a former Turkish writer, is an educational and research institute devoted to [[mathematics]] in [[Turkey]], which is located 800m from [[Şirince]] Village in [[Selçuk|Selçuk district]] of [[Izmir]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/haber-detay.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=70193|title=A brief introduction to Turkey’s ‘Mathematics Village|website=Hürriyet Daily News {{!}} LEADING NEWS SOURCE FOR TURKEY AND THE REGION|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2007 by [[Ali Nesin]], a veteran mathematician who heads up education non-profit [[Nesin Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/welcome-to-the-turkish-village-dedicated-to-maths|title=Welcome to the Turkish ‘Village’ Dedicated to Maths|website=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics Village is funded by donations made to the Nesin Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nesin Mathematics Village hosts various mathematical activities, mostly short summer courses. Teaching in the mathematics village "is voluntary;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while the mathematics village does not provide honoria for the teachers, it provides free accommodations and meals".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishnaswami Alladi and Gabriela Asli Rino Nesin|first=|year=2015|title=The Nesin Mathematics Village in Turkey|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201506/rnoti-p652.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=62-6|pages=652–658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses range from high-school to graduate university courses. All high school courses are taught in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as the students do not necessarily know foreign languages, but any undergraduate or postgraduate course may be taught in English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Students usually stay in the village for a cycle of two weeks. Each Thursday, a vacation activity is organized. There are no TVs or broadcast music, although there are occasionally film screenings.

Around fifteen paid staff and nearly one hundred volunteers work there every year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The village has also been hosting domestic and international mathematics meetings recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matematikkoyu.org/eng/events.php|title=Events {{!}} Nesin Mathematics Village|last=nesinvakfi.org|first=Nesin Vakfı -|website=matematikkoyu.org|language=tr|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Nesin is awarded the 2018 [[Leelavati Award]] for " his outstanding contributions towards increasing public awareness of mathematics in Turkey, in particular for his tireless work in creating the "Mathematical Village" as an exceptional, peaceful place for education, research and the exploration of mathematics for anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/leelavati-prize/leelavati-prize-2018|title=Leelavati Prize 2018 {{!}} International Mathematical Union (IMU)|website=www.mathunion.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition scare==
According to a statement in July 2017 by Tekin Karadağ, the president of the Şirince Environment and Nature Association, Nesin Mathematics Village was slated for demolition by the authorities as being an "illegal construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Şirince'de yıkım başlıyor|trans-title=Demolition begins in Şirince|author=Banu Şen|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/sirincede-yikim-basliyor-40536452|newspaper=[[Hürriyet]]|date=31 July 2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harun Abuş, Director of Development and City Planning of Selçuk Municipality, declared that at this moment Nesin Mathematics Village is "not on the demolition calendar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Şirince'deki Matematik Köyü ve Nişanyan Evleri, yıkım takviminde yok"|trans-title="Mathematics Village and Nişanyan Houses in Şirince not on the demolition calendar"|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/sirincedeki-matematik-koyu-ve-nisanyan-evleri-yikim-takvimde-yok,417504|newspaper=T24|date=1 August 2017|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Parasagitta elegans''''' is a small [[Chaetognatha|arrow worm]] in the family [[Sagittidae]], previously named ''Sagitta elegans''

==Morphology==

''Parasagitta elegans'' (prev. ''Sagitta elegans''). Body of adult animal is narrow, firm and opaque (this image: animal very see-through. Visible opaque animal needs better picture).

Fins are separated, rounded, and completely rayed. Anterior fins beginning below the ventral ganglion. Alimentary diverticula present. Eyes with small, round pigment spot. Ovaries long and narrow. Seminal vesicles conical in shape, either exactly next to or very close to the tail fin, separated from posterior fins.

For anatomy, reproduction, classification, and fossil record; see [[Chaetognatha]]

==Taxonomy==

Three subspecies are recognised - ''Sagitta elegans arctica'', ''Sagitta elegans baltica'' and ''Sagitta elegans elegans''.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal |author= Thuesen, Erik V. 
|title= Parasagitta elegans (Verrill, 1873). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=105440 on 2014-08-21
|journal=WoRMS|year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subspecies are considered to vary in size depending on the temperature of the waters in which they develop, which could be an indication of them being synonymous species. The numbers of hooks and teeth vary slightly in the three subspecies.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. C. Pierrot-Bults and K. C. Chidgey, edited by Doris M. Kermack and R. S. K. Barnes, 1988 |title= Chaetognatha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With exception for the [[Benthos|benthic]] species ''Spadella'', arrow worms are all adapted for [[plankton]]ic existence. They swim to the surface at night, and descend during daytime. Most of the time they drift passively, but they can dart forward in swift spurts, using their caudal fin and longitudinal muscles. Horizontal fins bordering the trunk serve largely as stabilizers, and are used in flotation rather than in active swimming.

===Distribution===

''Parasagitta elegans'' and the three subspecies occur in [[Arctic]] and subarctic waters. ''S. elegans elegans'' is a coastal subspecies with oceanic influence. ''S. elegans arctica'' is a boreal-arctic form, and ''S. elegans baltica'' is the smallest form, found only in or near the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal |author= Fraser, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4357">'''Pseudorationalism''' was the label given by economist and philosopher [[Otto Neurath]] to a school of thought that he was heavily critical of, throughout many of his writings but primarily in his 1913 paper "The lost wanderers of Descartes and the auxiliary motive" and later to a lesser extent in his 1935 "Pseudorationalismus der Falsifikation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Pseudorationalismus der Falsifikation |author=Otto Neurath |journal=[[Erkenntnis]] |year=1935 |volume=5 |number=1 |pages=353–365 |doi=10.1007/BF00172326}}&lt;/ref&gt; a review of and attack on [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s first book, ''Logik der Forschung'' (''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), contrasting this approach with his own view of what [[rationalism]] should properly be.{{sfn|Uebel|2008|p=54}}  Neurath aimed his criticism at a [[René Descartes|Cartes]]ian belief that all actions can be subject to rational analysis,{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}}{{sfn|Reisch|2005|p=31}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}} saying that

{{quote|Once reason has gained a certain influence, people generally show a tendency to regard all their actions as reasonable.  Ways of action which depend on dark instincts receive reinterpretation or obfuscation.|{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}} {{harvnb|Neurath|1913|p=441}}}}

Neurath considered that "pseudo-rationalists", be they philosophers or scientists, made the mistake of assuming that a complete rational system could be devised for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].  He argued rather that no system could be complete, being based upon a picture of reality that could only ever be incomplete and imperfect.  Pseudo-rationalism, in Neurath's view, was a refusal or simple inability to face up to the limits of rationality and reason.{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}}  "Rationalism", he wrote {{harv|Neurath|1913|p=8}}, "sees its chief triumph in the clear recognition of the limits of actual insight.".  Whereas a pseudorationalist acknowledges no such limits, but rather contents that ''all'' decisions can be subject to the rules of insight.{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}}  Scientific method is, according to Neurath, pseudorationalist where it contends that the rules for the [[scientific method]] will always lead ever closer to the truth.{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}}

Neurath further challenged Cartesian "pseudorationalism" by asserting that operating upon incomplete data was in fact the norm, where Cartesian thinking would have it be the rare exception.  Rather than there being one, final, rational answer to any given problem, Neurath asserted that scientific endeavour required a continuing and never-ending series of choices, made so in part because of the ambiguity of language.{{sfn|Reisch|2005|p=31}}

In statistics, '''response surface methodology (RSM)''' explores the relationships between several [[explanatory variable]]s and one or more [[response variable]]s.  The method was introduced by [[George E. P. Box]] and K. B. Wilson in 1951.  The main idea of RSM is to use a sequence of [[design of experiments|designed experiments]] to obtain an optimal response.  Box and Wilson suggest using a [[Degree of a polynomial|second-degree]] [[polynomial]] model to do this.  They acknowledge that this model is only an approximation, but they use it because such a model is easy to estimate and apply, even when little is known about the process.

Statistical approaches such as RSM can be employed to maximize the production of a special substance by optimization of operational factors. In contrast to conventional methods, the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Maged, Salah Haridy, Mohammad Shamsuzzaman, Imad Alsyouf, and Roubi Zaied.

==Basic approach of response surface methodology==
An easy way to estimate a first-degree polynomial model is to use a [[factorial experiment]] or a [[fractional factorial design]].  This is sufficient to determine which explanatory variables affect the response variable(s) of interest.  Once it is suspected that only significant explanatory variables are left, then a more complicated design, such as a [[central composite design]] can be implemented to estimate a second-degree polynomial model, which is still only an approximation at best.  However, the second-degree model can be used to optimize (maximize, minimize, or attain a specific target for).

==Important RSM properties and features==

''ORTHOGONALITY:''
The property that allows individual effects of the k-factors to be estimated independently without (or with minimal) confounding. Also orthogonality provides minimum variance estimates of the model coefficient so that they are uncorrelated.

''ROTATABILITY'':
The property of rotating points of the design about the center of the factor space. The moments of the distribution of the design points are constant.

''UNIFORMITY:''
A third property of CCD designs used to control the number of center points is uniform precision (or Uniformity).

==Special geometries==

===Cube===
Cubic designs are discussed by Kiefer, by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias and by Hardin and Sloane.

===Sphere===
[[Spherical design]]s are discussed by Kiefer and by Hardin and Sloane.

===Simplex geometry and mixture experiments===
Mixture experiments are discussed in many books on the [[design of experiments]], and in the response-surface methodology textbooks of Box and Draper and of Atkinson, Donev and Tobias. An extensive discussion and survey appears in the advanced textbook by John Cornell.

==Extensions==

&lt;!-- ===Constraints=== --&gt;

===Multiple objective functions===
{{see also|Multiobjective optimization|Pareto efficiency}}
Some extensions of response surface methodology deal with the multiple response problem.  Multiple response variables create difficulty because what is optimal for one response may not be optimal for other responses.  Other extensions are used to reduce variability in a single response while targeting a specific value, or attaining a near maximum or minimum while preventing variability in that response from getting too large.

==Practical concerns==
Response surface methodology uses statistical models, and therefore practitioners need to be aware that even the best statistical model is an approximation to reality. In practice, both the models and the parameter values are unknown, and subject to uncertainty on top of ignorance. Of course, an estimated optimum point need not be optimum in reality, because of the errors of the estimates and of the inadequacies of the model.

Nonetheless, response surface methodology has an effective track-record of helping researchers improve products and services: For example, Box's original response-surface modeling enabled chemical engineers to improve a process that had been stuck at a saddle-point for years. The engineers had not been able to afford to fit a cubic three-level design to estimate a quadratic model, and their [[Bias (statistics)|biased]] linear-models estimated the gradient to be zero. Box's design reduced the costs of experimentation so that a quadratic model could be fit, which led to a (long-sought) ascent direction.&lt;ref&gt;Box, G. E. P. and Wilson, K.B.

According to former pornographic actress [[Shelley Lubben]], a 1980s outbreak of HIV led to the death of 27 porn stars between 1985 and 1992, including [[Wade Nichols]] (who died in 1985),&lt;ref name=Lubben2013/&gt; [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] (1988), [[Marc Stevens (actor)|Marc Stevens]] (1989), and [[Al Parker]] (1992).&lt;ref name=Lubben2013&gt;{{cite web |last=Lubben |first=Shelley |date=September 3, 2013 |title=STD and HIV Outbreaks in the Porn Industry Since the 1980's |url=http://pornharmsresearch.com/2013/09/std-and-hiv-outbreaks-in-the-porn-industry-since-the-1980s/ |type=compilation |website=pornharmsresearch.com |publisher=Morality in Media |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1986, Holmes was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Six months previously, he had tested negative. During the summer of 1986, Holmes, knowing his HIV status, agreed to perform in two pornographic films to be filmed in Italy, without informing the producers of his HIV status. Performers in one film, ''The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress'', were [[Ilona Staller|Ilona "Cicciolina" Staller]], who later became a member of the Italian parliament, [[Tracey Adams]], [[Christoph Clark]], and [[Amber Lynn]].&lt;ref name=Huge2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Various |year=2008 |editor-last=Patrick |editor-first=John |title=Huge |publisher=STARbooks |page=13 |isbn=978-1-934187-29-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers in the other film, ''The Devil In Mr. Holmes'', were Adams, Lynn, [[Karin Schubert]], and [[Marina Hedman]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Subsequently, it was revealed that Holmes had consciously chosen not to reveal his HIV status to his producers or co-stars before engaging in unprotected sex for the filming.&lt;ref name=Huge2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden010112&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=12 January 2001 |title= WADD: The Life and Times of John C.

The heterosexual segment of the porn industry voluntarily shut down for 30 days (a 60-day moratorium was originally announced but it was lifted early) while it tried to deal with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7652.php AIDS in pornography industry of California contained says adult industry body]&lt;/ref&gt; Darren James, Jessica Dee, and Lara Roxx were barred from further production of sexually explicit content. About 60 actors who had had contact with James or Roxx were barred from working until HIV tests were completed and they were declared HIV negative. A further estimated 130 actors who had had contact with James were tested and received an HIV-negative result. A total of five actors were diagnosed with the virus by the end of the moratorium: one male and four females, including one transgender woman&lt;ref name="afyi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lat1" /&gt; named Jennifer.&lt;ref name=AVNMay2004 /&gt;

In June 2009, AIM reported that a female adult entertainer had tested positive, though it was believed that transmission occurred in her private life. LA County Public Health claimed that there had been 16 "unreported" HIV cases in the adult film industry. The AIM Healthcare Foundation claimed those cases did not involve actors in production companies that followed their testing protocols and included members of the general public who used AIM Healthcare testing services or individuals attempting to work in the porn industry who never were able to obtain employment in adult films because of their failure to provide proof negative status for HIV or other STD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-porn-hiv12-2009jun12,0,3569962.story More porn HIV cases disclosed]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a male porn actor tested HIV positive, leading FSC to halt production for one week. This infection was also determined to have taken place off-set.&lt;ref name="PASS Blog"/&gt;

==Testing and clinics==
The revelations led to the creation of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM Healthcare or AIM) in 1998, which helped set up a monitoring system in the pornographic film industry in the United States, and pornographic film actors were required to be tested for HIV every 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basten|first=Fred |author2=Laurie Holmes |author3=John C. Holmes|title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIM system required all sexual contact to be logged, with positive test results leading to all sexual contacts for the last three to six months being contacted and re-tested. The use of condoms became standard in films featuring homosexual [[anal sex]].{{why?|date=January 2018}} Due to accurate and mandatory medical tests, HIV and [[AIDS]] cases became rare in the pornographic film industry.{{source needed|date=January 2018}}

However, testing is voluntary (though refusal to be tested can result in the actor not being cast in a sex role) and there is no testing or monitoring of the pornographic film industry in other countries. There have been indications that actors have voluntarily left the industry, at least the industry in the United States, rather than be tested by AIM and have their AIDS and HIV status disclosed.

AIM closed all its operations in May 2011, forcing the industry to look for other mechanisms for supporting and enforcing regular testing.&lt;ref name="romero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/05/porn_clinic_closed_aim_testing.php|title=Porn Clinic AIM Closes For Good: Valley-Based Industry Scrambles to Find New STD Testing System|last=Dennis Romero|date=May 3, 2011|work=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap was filled by the [[Free Speech Coalition]], which set up the APHSS system, now known as [[Performer Availability Screening Services]] (PASS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSC Pass |url=http://www.fscpass.com|accessdate= |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Regulations to limit the spread of HIV===
Due to this limited outbreak, the California State government considered regulating the industry. Some proposed to mandate the wearing of [[condom]]s during sexually explicit scenes. Industry insiders say this would ruin sales of their wares since the unprotected content is one of the selling points of some of their films. They say the wearing of condoms ruins the sexual fantasies of many viewers. Insiders say that such regulation would force the industry underground, out of California or overseas where it would be more prone to health risks for performers. The non-profit [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM Healthcare) worked with the government, to develop policies that both the industry and the government would find acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1892037 | pmid=17579507 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040126 | volume=4 | issue=6 | title=The adult film industry: time to regulate? | year=2007 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e126 | last1 = Grudzen | first1 = CR | last2 = Kerndt | first2 = PR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ballot measure in Los Angeles ===
In the 2012 election voters in Los Angeles were presented with [[Measure B]] ("Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act") with the following text:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/11/06/ca/la/meas/B/|title=Measure B: Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act - Los Angeles County, CA|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Shall an ordinance be adopted requiring producers of adult films to obtain a County public health permit, to require adult film performers to use condoms while engaged in sex acts, to provide proof of blood borne pathogen training course, to post permit and notices to performers, and making violations of the ordinance subject to civil fines and criminal charges?}}

Proponents of the measure claimed pornography performers were significantly more likely to acquire HIV than the general population and that they are generally not given health insurance by their employers and so the tax payer would foot the bill for HIV treatment. Opponents claimed it to be a waste of tax dollars because of existing stringent HIV testing protocols and because nobody has contracted HIV on set in the past eight years in the United States.{{When|date=September 2016}}

The measure passed with 57% voting for and 43% voting against.&lt;ref name=DailyMail8November2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Shergold|first=Adam|title=California votes to mandate condoms in porn industry|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2229232/Measure-B-California-votes-mandate-condoms-LA-porn-industry-amid-fears-industry-leave-state.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail (London)|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn industry trade group vows to fight condom requirement|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/porn-industry-trade-group-plans-to-fight-condom-decision.html|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California's Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health's Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Industrial Revolution''', also known as the '''Technological Revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muntone|first=Stephanie|title=Second Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|work=Education.com|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|accessdate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022224325/http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a phase of rapid [[industrialization]] in the final third of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The [[First Industrial Revolution]], which ended in the early to mid 1800s, was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions{{clarify|date=January 2018}} before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in [[manufacturing]], such as the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, the development of methods for manufacturing [[interchangeable parts]] and the invention of the [[Bessemer Process]] to produce [[steel]], the Second Industrial Revolution is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 (the start of [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ushistoryscene.com/article/second-industrial-revolution/ The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870-1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of preexisting technological systems such as [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] and [[railroad]] networks, gas and [[water supply]], and [[sewage systems]], which had earlier been concentrated to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas, which culminated in a new wave of [[globalization]]. In the same time period, new technological systems were introduced, most significantly [[electrical power]] and [[telephone]]s. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory [[electrification]] and the [[production line]], and ended at the start of [[World War I]].

==Overview==
The Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, primarily in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], but also in [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. It followed on from the [[First Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe and North America. It was characterized by the build out of [[railroad]]s, large-scale iron and [[steel]] production, widespread use of [[machinery]] in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power, widespread use of the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], use of [[petroleum]] and the beginning of [[electrification]].  It also was the period during which modern organizational methods for operating large scale businesses over vast areas came into use.

The concept was introduced by [[Patrick Geddes]], ''[[Patrick Geddes#Published works|Cities in Evolution]]'' (1910), but [[David Landes]]' use of the term in a 1966 essay and in ''[[The Unbound Prometheus]]'' (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] (1918–2007). However, some continue to express reservations about its use.&lt;ref&gt;James Hull, "The Second Industrial Revolution: The History of a Concept", ''Storia Della Storiografia,'' 1999, Issue 36, pp 81–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Landes (2003) stresses the importance of new technologies, especially, the [[internal combustion engine]] and petroleum, new materials and substances, including alloys and [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], electricity and communication technologies (such as the [[telegraph]], telephone and [[radio]]).

Vaclav Smil called the period 1867–1914 "The Age of [[Synergy]]" during which most of the great innovations were developed since the inventions and innovations were engineering and [[Applied science|science-based]].&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |authorlink=Vaclav Smil  |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-516874-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry and technology ==
A synergy between iron and steel, railroads and coal developed at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.  Railroads allowed cheap transportation of materials and products, which in turn led to cheap rails to build more roads.  Railroads also benefited from cheap coal for their steam locomotives.  This synergy led to the laying of 75,000 miles of track in the U.S. in the 1880s, the largest amount anywhere in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron ===
The [[hot blast]] technique, in which the hot [[flue gas]] from a blast furnace is used to [[air preheater|preheat]] combustion air blown into a [[blast furnace]], was invented and patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828 at [[Wilsontown Ironworks]] in Scotland. Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, and was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first=David.  S.|authorlink=David Landes|year=1969|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-09418-6|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling costs for producing [[wrought iron]] coincided with the emergence of the [[railway]] in the 1830s.

The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium.  Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. [[Edward Alfred Cowper]] developed the Cowper stove in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=256–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem.  The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces.  The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.

With the greatly reduced cost of producing pig iron with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] using hot blast, demand grew dramatically and so did the size of blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Steel ===
[[File:ConverterB.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Bessemer converter]]. Air blown through holes in the converter bottom creates a violent reaction in the molten pig iron that oxidizes the excess carbon, converting the pig iron to pure iron or steel, depending on the residual carbon.]]

The [[Bessemer process]], invented by [[Sir Henry Bessemer]], allowed the [[mass-production]] of [[steel]], increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material, and decreasing the labor requirements. The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from [[pig iron]] by [[oxidation]] with air blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

The "acid" Bessemer process had a serious limitation in that it required relatively scarce [[hematite]] ore&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is low in phosphorus. [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] developed a more sophisticated process to eliminate the [[phosphorus]] from [[iron]]. Collaborating with his cousin, [[Percy Gilchrist]] a chemist at the [[Blaenavon Ironworks]], [[Wales]], he patented his process in 1878;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-THOM-GIL-1850.html ''Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist'' at Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolckow Vaughan]] &amp; Co. in [[Yorkshire]] was the first company to use his patented process.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist |volume=26 |page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; His process was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron was much greater than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom/&gt;

[[File:Barrow Steelworks.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]] operated 18 Bessemer converters and owned the largest steelworks in the world at the turn of the 20th century.]]

The next great advance in steel making was the [[Siemens-Martin process]]. Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, for which he claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.

French engineer [[Pierre-Émile Martin]] was the first to take out a license for the Siemens furnace and apply it to the production of steel in 1865. The Siemens-Martin process complemented rather than replaced the [[Bessemer process]].  Its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), it was easier to control, and that it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. It became the leading steel making process by the early 20th century.

The availability of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, [[skyscraper]]s, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other important steel products—also made using the open hearth process—were [[steel cable]], steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled much more powerful engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s and naval ships.

=== Rail ===
[[File:The rail rolling mill, Hughesovka.jpg|thumb|300px|A rail rolling mill in [[Donetsk]], 1887.]]
The increase in steel production from the 1860s meant that [[railroad]]s could finally be made from steel at a competitive cost. Being a much more durable material, steel steadily replaced iron as the standard for railway rail, and due to its greater strength, longer lengths of rails could now be rolled. [[Wrought iron]] was soft and contained flaws caused by included [[dross]].  Iron rails could also not support heavy locomotives and was damaged by [[hammer blow]]. The first to make durable [[rail profile|rails]] of steel rather than [[wrought iron]] was [[Robert Forester Mushet]] at the [[Darkhill Ironworks]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1857.

The first of his steel rails was sent to [[Derby Midland railway station]].  They were laid at part of the station approach where the iron rails had to be renewed at least every six months, and occasionally every three. Six years later, in 1863, the rail seemed as perfect as ever, although some 700 trains had passed over it daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolt |first1=L.T.C |title=Victorian Engineering |year=1974 |origyear= |publisher=Pelican |location=London |isbn=  |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the accelerated construction of [[railways|rail transportation]] throughout the world in the late nineteenth century.  Steel rails lasted over ten times longer than did iron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0801811481 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the falling cost of steel, heavier weight rails were used.  This allowed the use of more powerful locomotives, which could pull longer trains, and longer rail cars, all of which greatly increased the productivity of railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first=Nathan|authorlink=|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-27367-6|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rail became the dominant form of transport infrastructure throughout the industrialized world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Grubler|first1=Arnulf|author1-link=|title=The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures|year=1990|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a steady decrease in the cost of shipping seen for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name ="Fogel1964"&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0-8018-1148-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrification ===
{{Main|Electrification|Electricity}}
The theoretical and practical basis for the harnessing of electric power was laid by the scientist and experimentalist [[Michael Faraday]]. Through his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]], Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Faraday, Michael |volume=10 |page=173 |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004417/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] were the foundation of the practical use of electricity in technology.

[[File:Light bulb Edison 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|U.S. Patent#223898: Electric-Lamp. Issued January 27, 1880.]]

In 1881, [[Sir Joseph Swan]], inventor of the first feasible [[incandescent light bulb]], supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps to the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the City of Westminster, London, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', October 3, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRE&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html Description of lightbulb experiment] in ''The Times'', December 29, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Swan's lightbulb had already been used in 1879 to light Mosley Street, in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the first electrical street lighting installation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|title=Sir Joseph Wilson Swan|publisher=home.frognet.net|accessdate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005841/http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Chemsoc/Activities/ChemicalLandmarks/UK/JosephSwan.asp |title=Sir Joseph Swan, The Literary &amp; Philosophical Society of Newcastle |date=3 February 2009 |publisher=rsc.org |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the stage for the electrification of industry and the home.

Each wire carries current 120 degrees apart in phase. Arrows show the resulting magnetic force vectors. Three phase current is used in commerce and industry.]]

The first modern power station in the world was built by the English [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]] at [[Deptford]]. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) [[alternating current]], it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it supplied high-voltage [[AC power]] that was then "stepped down" with transformers for consumer use on each street. [[Electrification]] allowed the final major developments in manufacturing methods of the Second Industrial Revolution, namely the [[assembly line]] and [[mass production]].&lt;ref name ="Ford1922"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Henry|author1-link=Henry Ford|author2=Crowther, Samuel |title=My Life and Work: An Autobiography of Henry Ford|year=1922|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrification]] was called "the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century" by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives |last=Constable |first=George|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |year=2003 |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC |isbn= 0-309-08908-5 |pages= |url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=2988 }} (Viewable on line)&lt;/ref&gt; Electric lighting in factories greatly improved working conditions, eliminating the heat and pollution caused by gas lighting, and reducing the fire hazard to the extent that the cost of electricity for lighting was often offset by the reduction in fire insurance premiums. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor in 1886. By 1889 110 electric [[tram|street railways]] were either using his equipment or in planning.  The electric street railway became a major infrastructure before 1920.  The AC ([[Induction motor]]) was developed in the 1890s and soon began to be used in the [[electrification#History of electrification|electrification]] of industry.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink=  |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= |pages=14, 15 |url= |location= Cambridge, MA; London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household electrification did not become common until the 1920s, and then only in cities. [[Fluorescent light]]ing was commercially introduced at the [[1939 World's Fair]].

Electrification also allowed the inexpensive production of [[Electrochemistry#19th century|electro-chemicals]], such as aluminium, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and magnesium.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine tools ===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|A graphic representation of formulas for the pitches of threads of screw bolts.]]

The use of [[machine tool]]s began with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution|First Industrial Revolution]]. The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]—and hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s boring machine, that bored a precise hole in [[James Watt]]'s first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to [[Henry Maudslay]] and refined by [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Standardization of screw threads began with [[Henry Maudslay]] around 1800, when the modern [[screw-cutting lathe]] made [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.

In 1841, [[Joseph Whitworth]] created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became the world's first national machine tool standard called [[British Standard Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 9–10.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards.

The importance of [[machine tools]] to mass production is shown by the fact that production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools, most of which were powered by electricity.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Ford]] is quoted as saying that mass production would not have been possible without electricity because it allowed placement of machine tools and other equipment in the order of the work flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last=Ford |first=Henry |authorlink= |author2=Crowther, Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |isbn= |pages=30 |url= |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper making ===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
The first paper making machine was the [[Fourdrinier machine]], built by Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers in [[London]]. In 1800, [[Matthias Koops]], working in London, investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000'', Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}. pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1840s,  that [[Charles Fenerty]] in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] in [[Saxony]] both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood (as with rags) and from it, made paper.

Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with the invention of the [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also allowed keeping personal diaries or writing letters and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. By the 1880s chemical processes for paper manufacture were in use, becoming dominant by 1900.

=== Petroleum ===
The [[petroleum industry#History|petroleum industry]], both production and [[Petroleum refinery|refining]], began in 1848 with the first oil works in Scotland. The chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] set up a small business refining the crude oil in 1848. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | authorlink = | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 Young built the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world at [[Bathgate]], using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

[[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|Cable tool drilling]] was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells.  The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine.  Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;

Although there were many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is considered the first "modern oil well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vArc08DO9ykC&amp;pg=PA13 M.

Kerosene lighting was much more efficient and less expensive than vegetable oils, tallow and whale oil.  Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until the invention of the [[gas mantle]]. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. [[Gasoline]] was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the [[Burton process]] for [[cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.&lt;ref name = Yergin/&gt;

=== Chemical ===
[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1881]]
[[Synthetic dye]] was discovered by English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] in 1856. At the time, chemistry was still in a quite primitive state; it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds and chemical industry was still in its infancy. Perkin's accidental discovery was that [[aniline]] could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He scaled up production of the new "[[mauveine]]", and commercialized it as the world's first synthetic dye.&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"&gt;Michigan State University, Department of Chemistry website.{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202902/http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }} Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of mauveine, many new [[aniline dye]]s appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.
Towards the end of the century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.

=== Maritime technology ===
[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The launch of [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], which was advanced for her time, 1843.|alt=A crowd of people watch a large black and red ship with one funnel and six masts adorned with flags]]
This era saw the birth of the modern ship as disparate technological advances came together.

The [[propeller (marine)|screw propeller]] was introduced in 1835 by [[Francis Pettit Smith]] who discovered a new way of building propellers by accident. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length. But during the testing of a boat propelled by one, the screw snapped off, leaving a fragment shaped much like a modern boat propeller. The boat moved faster with the broken propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |title=History and Design of Propellers: Part 1 |publisher=the boatbuilding.community |accessdate=2007-09-03 |date=2004-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811200813/http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superiority of screw against paddles was taken up by navies. Trials with Smith's [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], the first steam driven screw, led to the famous tug-of-war competition in 1845 between the screw-driven {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}} and the paddle steamer {{HMS|Alecto|1839|6}}; the former pulling the latter backward at 2.5 knots (4.6&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The first seagoing iron steamboat was built by [[Horseley Ironworks]] and named the ''[[Aaron Manby]]''. It also used an innovative oscillating engine for power. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets.

Other technological developments followed, including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on purified water rather than salt water, eliminating the need to stop to clean them on long sea journeys. The ''[[SS Great Western|Great Western]]''&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan (2006), pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref name="Beckett 2006, pp. 171–173"&gt;Beckett (2006), pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumpleton and Miller (2002), pp. 34–46&lt;/ref&gt; built by engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[keel]] and was the first to prove that transatlantic steamship services were viable. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails.

Brunel followed this up with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], launched in 1843 and considered the first modern ship built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, John H (2003). ''The Engines of Our Ingenuity''. [[Oxford University Press]] (US). {{ISBN|978-0-19-516731-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunel's vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

Highly efficient [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion steam engines]] began being used on ships, allowing them to carry less coal than freight.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt; [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|The oscillating engine]] was first built by [[Aaron Manby (ironmaster)|Aaron Manby]] and Joseph Maudslay in the 1820s as a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term ''oscillating''.

It was [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]], engineer for the [[Royal Navy]] who perfected the oscillating engine. One of his earliest engines was the [[grasshopper beam engine]]. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the [[Admiralty]] yacht, {{HMS|Black Eagle}} with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay, Son &amp; Field]]. Penn also introduced the [[marine steam engine#Trunk|trunk engine]] for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. {{HMS|Encounter|1846|6}} (1846) and {{HMS|Arrogant|1848|6}} (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships and were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.&lt;ref&gt;Osbon, G. A., 1965, The Crimean War gunboats. Part. 1. The Mariner's Mirror, The Journal of the Society of Nautical Research. 51, 103–116 &amp; Preston, A., &amp; Major, 1965, J., Send a gunboat. Longmans, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution in naval design led to the first modern [[battleship]]s in the 1870s, evolved from the [[ironclad]] design of the 1860s. The [[Devastation-class ironclad|''Devastation''-class]] [[turret ship]]s were built for the British [[Royal Navy]] as the first class of ocean-going [[capital ship]] that did not carry [[sail]]s, and the first whose entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

===Rubber===
The [[vulcanization]] of [[rubber]], by American [[Charles Goodyear]] and Englishman [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in the 1840s paved the way for a growing rubber industry, especially the manufacture of [[Tyres|rubber tyre]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Veu9u0brhrcC&amp;pg=PA245 |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boyd Dunlop]] developed the first practical [[pneumatic]] tyre in 1887 in South Belfast. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's newly invented pneumatic tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling - William Hume, 1938.

&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;[http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/ Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlop's development of the pneumatic tyre arrived at a crucial time in the development of [[road transport]] and commercial production began in late 1890.

===Bicycles===
The modern bicycle was designed by the English engineer [[Harry John Lawson]] in 1876, although it was [[John Kemp Starley]] who produced the first commercially successful safety bicycle a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/technology/1880-1939/IC.025/|title=Icons of Invention: Rover safety bicycle, 1885|publisher=The Science Museum.|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity soon grew, causing the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.

Road networks improved greatly in the period, using the [[Macadam]] method pioneered by Scottish engineer [[John Loudon McAdam]], and hard surfaced roads were built around the time of the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Modern [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was patented by British civil engineer [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=Morton2002&gt;{{citation |year=2002 |author=Ralph Morton|title=Construction UK: Introduction to the Industry| place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Science|page=51 |isbn=0-632-05852-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW4CRawd1TgC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile===
German inventor [[Karl Benz]] patented the world's [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|first automobile]] in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition &lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]]&lt;/ref&gt; and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. It was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage.

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history.

[[Henry Ford]] built his first car in 1896 and worked as a pioneer in the industry, with others who would eventually form their own companies, until the founding of Ford Motor Company in 1903.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; Ford and others at the company struggled with ways to scale up production in keeping with Henry Ford's vision of a car designed and manufactured on a scale so as to be affordable by the average worker.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; The solution that Ford Motor developed was a completely redesigned factory with [[machine tools]] and special purpose machines that were systematically positioned in the work sequence. All unnecessary human motions were eliminated by placing all work and tools within easy reach, and where practical on conveyors, forming the [[assembly line]], the complete process being called [[mass production]]. This was the first time in history when a large, complex product consisting of 5000 parts had been produced on a scale of hundreds of thousands per year.&lt;ref name ="Ford1922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; The savings from [[mass production]] methods allowed the price of the [[Model T]] to decline from $780 in 1910 to $360 in 1916. In 1924 2 million T-Fords were produced and retailed $290 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied science===
[[Applied science]] opened many opportunities. By the middle of the 19th century there was a scientific understanding of chemistry and a fundamental understanding of [[thermodynamics]] and by the last quarter of the century both of these sciences were near their present-day basic form. Thermodynamic principles were used in the development of [[physical chemistry]]. Understanding chemistry greatly aided the development of basic inorganic chemical manufacturing and the aniline dye industries.

The science of [[metallurgy]] was advanced through the work of [[Henry Clifton Sorby]] and others. Sorby pioneered the study of [[iron]] and [[steel]] under [[microscope]], which paved the way for a scientific understanding of metal and the mass-production of steel. In 1863 he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of metals and was the first to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Henry Clifton Sorby|url=http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211758/http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for [[Henry Bessemer]] and [[Robert Forester Mushet]] to develop the method for mass-producing steel.

Other processes were developed for purifying various elements such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[nickel]] which could be used for making alloys with special properties, especially with steel. [[Vanadium steel]], for example, is strong and fatigue resistant, and was used in half the automotive steel.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (2006) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Alloy steels were used for ball bearings which were used in large scale bicycle production in the 1880s.  Ball and roller bearings also began being used in machinery.  Other important alloys are used in high temperatures, such as steam turbine blades, and stainless steels for corrosion resistance.

The work of [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] laid the groundwork for modern industrial chemistry. Liebig is considered the "father of the fertilizer industry" for his discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient and went on to establish [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] which produced the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] [[meat extract]]. Hofmann headed a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the [[Royal College of Chemistry]], introduced modern conventions for [[molecular modeling]] and taught Perkin who discovered the first synthetic dye.

The science of [[thermodynamics]] was developed into its modern form by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[William Rankine]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]]. These scientific principles were applied to a variety of industrial concerns, including improving the efficiency of boilers and [[steam turbine]]s. The work of [[Michael Faraday]] and others was pivotal in laying the foundations of the modern scientific understanding of [[electricity]].

Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was particularly influential—his discoveries ushered in the era of [[modern physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Knots_and_physics.html |title=Topology and Scottish mathematical physics |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that described [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] as manifestations of the same [[phenomenon]], namely the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of [[radio waves]] and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865 |bibcode=1865RSPT..155..459C |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell himself developed the first durable [[Color photography|colour photograph]] in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maxwell, James Clerk |year=1868 |title=On Governors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=16 |pages=270–283 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055 |jstor=112510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Otto | author-link= Otto Mayr | title=Maxwell and the Origins of Cybernetics |journal=Isis |volume=62 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=424–444 |doi=10.1086/350788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control theory is the basis for [[process control]], which is widely used in [[automation]], particularly for [[process industries]], and for controlling ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800–1930 |last=Benett|first= Stuart|authorlink=|year=1986|publisher =Institution of Engineering and Technology
|location=|isbn= 978-0-86341-047-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Control theory]] was developed to analyze the functioning of [[centrifugal governor]]s on steam engines.  These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by [[James Watt]].  Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders.  However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which marked the beginning of the formal development of control theory.  The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.

===Fertilizer===
[[Justus von Liebig]] was the first to understand the importance of [[ammonia]] as [[fertilizer]], and promoted the importance of inorganic minerals to [[plant nutrition]]. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating [[phosphate of lime]] in bone meal with [[sulfuric acid]]. Another pioneer was [[John Bennet Lawes]] who began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, leading to a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid; this was to be the first product of the nascent artificial manure industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lawes, Sir John Bennet |volume=16 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[Coprolite#Coprolite mining|coprolites]] in commercial quantities in [[East Anglia]], led Fisons and [[Edward Packard (businessman, born 1819)|Edward Packard]] to develop one of the first large-scale commercial fertilizer plants at [[Bramford]], and [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] in the 1850s. By the 1870s [[superphosphate]]s produced in those factories, were being shipped around the world from the port at [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html History of Fisons at Yara.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520151251/http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50172&amp;back=|title=Oxford DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Birkeland–Eyde process]] was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] along with his business partner [[Sam Eyde]] in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Aaron John Ihde|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0486642356|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon replaced by the much more efficient [[Haber process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short history of twentieth-century technology c. 1900-c. 1950|author1=Trevor Illtyd Williams|author2=Thomas Kingston Derry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0198581599|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
developed by the [[Nobel prize]]-winning chemists [[Carl Bosch]] of [[IG Farben]] and [[Fritz Haber]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/haberbosch.html Haber &amp; Bosch ''Most influential persons of the 20th century''], by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;/ref&gt; The process utilized molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material for production of [[nitric acid]].

===Engines and turbines===
The [[steam turbine]] was developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]] in 1884. His first model was connected to a [[dynamo]] that generated 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW (10&amp;nbsp;hp) of electricity.&lt;ref name="birrcastle.com"&gt;[http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152751/http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp |date=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized [[Turbinia|marine transport and naval warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110063209/http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parson's death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary power rather than reciprocating power which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine's first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.

The first widely used [[internal combustion engine]] was the [[Otto engine|Otto type]] of 1876. From the 1880s until electrification it was successful in small shops because small steam engines were inefficient and required too much operator attention.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt; The Otto engine soon began being used to power automobiles, and remains as today's common gasoline engine.

The [[diesel engine]] was independently designed by [[Rudolf Diesel]] and [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] in the 1890s using thermodynamic principles with the specific intention of being highly efficient. It took several years to perfect and become popular, but found application in shipping before powering locomotives. It remains the world's most efficient prime mover.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

The first commercial [[telegraph]] system was installed by Sir [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] in May 1837 between [[Euston railway station]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EKr7FUkw?url=http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm |date=2013-02-10 }} BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first [[undersea cable]] being built by [[John Watkins Brett]] between [[France]] and [[England]].
The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. This was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Arthur (1994). The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization. p. 203. Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-85573-301-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1850s until 1911, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref name="kennedy197110"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=563928| title=Imperial Cable Communications and Strategy, 1870-1914 | author=Kennedy, P.

The [[telephone]] was patented in 1876 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and like the early telegraph, it was used mainly to speed business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John, ''Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications''  (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, one of the most important scientific advancements in all of history was the unification of light, electricity and magnetism through [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory]]. A scientific understanding of electricity was necessary for the development of efficient electric generators, motors and transformers. [[David Edward Hughes]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] both demonstrated and confirmed the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves that had been predicted by Maxwell.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

It was Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amit|last=Roy|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081208/jsp/nation/story_10221833.jsp|work=The Telegraph|location=[[Kolkota]]|title=Cambridge 'pioneer' honour for Bose|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Marconi Company|The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of the Mysteries and Marvels of the Ingenious Irish|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year transmitted [[Morse code]] across [[Salisbury Plain]], sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea&lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070120163444/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]&lt;/ref&gt; and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]] to [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key development of the [[vacuum tube]] by Sir [[John Ambrose Fleming]] in 1904 underpinned the development of modern electronics and radio broadcasting. [[Lee De Forest]]'s subsequent invention of the [[triode]] allowed the amplification of electronic signals, which paved the way for radio broadcasting in the 1920s.

===Modern business management===
Railroads are credited with creating the modern [[business enterprise]] by scholars such as Alfred Chandler.  Previously, the management of most businesses had consisted of individual owners or groups of partners, some of whom often had little daily hands-on operations involvement.  Centralized expertise in the home office was not enough.  A railroad required expertise available across the whole length of its trackage, to deal with daily crises, breakdowns and bad weather.    A collision in Massachusetts in 1841 led to a call for safety reform.  This led to the reorganization of railroads into different departments with clear lines of management authority.  When the telegraph became available, companies built telegraph lines  along the railroads to keep track of trains.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads involved complex operations and employed extremely large amounts of capital and ran a more complicated business compared to anything previous.  Consequently, they needed better ways to track costs.  For example, to calculate rates they needed to know the cost of a ton-mile of freight.  They also needed to keep track of cars, which could go missing for months at a time.  This led to what was called "railroad accounting", which was later adopted by steel and other industries, and eventually became modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last= Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred |date= 1993 |title= The Visible Hand|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 115 |isbn= 0674417682 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lAI3AwAAQBAJ | access-date = 2017-06-29 | quote = [...] American railroad accounting overstated operating costs and understated capital consumption.[...] The basic innovations in financial and capital accounting appeared in the 1850s in response to specific needs and were perfected in the years after the Civil War.

&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Later in the Second Industrial Revolution, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and others in America developed the concept of [[scientific management]] or [[Taylorism]]. Scientific management initially concentrated on reducing the steps taken in performing work (such as bricklaying or shoveling) by using analysis such as [[time and motion study|time-and-motion studies]], but the concepts evolved into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], and [[business management]] that helped to completely restructure{{cn|date=June 2017}} the operations of factories, and later entire segments of the economy.

Taylor's core principles included:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* replacing rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks
* scientifically selecting, training, and developing each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves
* providing "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task"
* dividing work nearly equally between managers and workers, such that the managers apply scientific-management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

==Socio-economic impacts==
The period from 1870 to 1890 saw the greatest increase in economic growth in such a short period as ever in previous history. Living standards improved significantly in the newly industrialized countries as the prices of goods fell dramatically due to the increases in [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)|productivity]].  This caused [[unemployment]] and great upheavals in commerce and industry, with many laborers being displaced by machines and many factories, ships and other forms of fixed capital becoming obsolete in a very short time span.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The economic changes that have occurred during the last quarter of a century -or during the present generation of living men- have unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world's history".&lt;ref name ="Wells1890"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crop failures no longer resulted in starvation in areas connected to large markets through transport infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

Massive improvements in public health and sanitation resulted from [[public health]] initiatives, such as the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] in the 1860s and the passage of laws that regulated filtered water supplies—(the [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced regulation of the water supply companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time in 1852). This greatly reduced the infection and death rates from many diseases.

By 1870 the work done by steam engines exceeded that done by animal and human power.  Horses and mules remained important in agriculture until the development of the internal combustion tractor near the end of the Second Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ayres|last2=Warr|first1=Robert U.|first2 = Benjamin|author1-link =|title=Accounting for Growth: The Role of Physical Work|year=2004|url=http://www.iea.org/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in steam efficiency, like [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, allowed ships to carry much more freight than coal, resulting in greatly increased volumes of international trade.  Higher steam engine efficiency caused the number of steam engines to increase several fold, leading to an increase in coal usage, the phenomenon being called the [[Jevons paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 1890 there was an international telegraph network allowing orders to be placed by merchants in England or the US to suppliers in India and China for goods to be transported in efficient new steamships.  This, plus the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], led to the decline of the great warehousing districts in London and elsewhere, and the elimination of many middlemen.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

The tremendous growth in productivity, transportation networks, industrial production and agricultural output lowered the prices of almost all goods.  This led to many business failures and periods that were called ''depressions'' that occurred as the world economy actually grew.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;  See also: [[Long depression]]

The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists (as opposed to work at home). The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive, and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers. The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1730s, when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50%, a development that would only happen elsewhere (the [[Low Countries]]) in the 1830s and '40s. By 1890, the figure had fallen to under 10% percent and the vast majority of the British population was [[urbanization|urbanized]]. This milestone was reached by the [[Low Countries]] and the US in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Grigg|title=Agriculture in the World Economy: an Historical Geography of Decline|journal=|jstor=40572192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first industrial revolution, the second supported population growth and saw most governments protect their national economies with tariffs. Britain retained its belief in [[free trade]] throughout this period.  The wide-ranging social impact of both revolutions included the remaking of the working class as new technologies appeared. The changes resulted in the creation of a larger, increasingly professional, middle class, the decline of child labor and the dramatic growth of a consumer-based, material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the leaders in industrial production was Britain with 24% of the world total, followed by the US (19%), Germany (13%), Russia (9%) and France (7%). Europe together accounted for 62%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p. 149, based on Paul Bairoch, "International Industrialization Levels from 1750 to 1980," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1982) v. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The great inventions and innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution are part of our modern life.  They continued to be drivers of the economy until after WWII.  Only a few major innovations occurred in the post-war era, some of which are: computers, semiconductors, the fiber optic network and the Internet, cellular telephones, [[combustion turbine]]s (jet engines) and the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives|last=Constable|first=George|authorlink=|author2=Somerville, Bob|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-08908-5|pages=|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/id=2988}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}This link is to entire on line book.&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial aviation existed before WWII, it became a major industry after the war.

==United Kingdom==

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
New products and services were introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap steel meant that slow, sailing ships were replaced with faster steamship, which could handle more trade with smaller crews. The [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries also moved to the forefront. Britain invested less in technological research than the U.S. and Germany, which caught up.

The development of more intricate and efficient machines along with [[mass production]] techniques (after 1910) greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &amp;mdash; and falling &amp;mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.

==United States==
The U.S. had its highest economic growth rate in the last two decades of the Second Industrial Revolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vatter | last2 = Walker| last3 =Alperovitz| first1 = Harold G.| first2 = John F.| first3 =Gar| author1-link =| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910–1990, Journal of Economic Issues| date = June 1995| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5437/is_n2_v29/ai_n28658086/| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, population growth slowed while productivity growth peaked around the mid 20th century.  The [[Gilded Age]] in America was based on heavy industry such as factories, railroads and [[coal mining]].  The iconic event was the opening of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, providing six-day service between the East Coast and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Gilded Age, American railroad mileage tripled between 1860 and 1880, and tripled again by 1920, opening new areas to commercial farming, creating a truly national marketplace and inspiring a boom in coal mining and steel production. The voracious appetite for capital of the great trunk railroads facilitated the consolidation of the nation's financial market in [[Wall Street]]. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry&amp;mdash;a few large corporations, some organized as "trusts" (e.g. Standard Oil), dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meatpacking, and the manufacture of agriculture machinery. Other major components of this infrastructure were the new methods for manufacturing steel, especially the [[Bessemer process]]. The first billion-dollar corporation was [[United States Steel]], formed by financier [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1901, who purchased and consolidated steel firms built by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and others.&lt;ref name="Edward C. Kirkland 1961"&gt;Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry Comes of Age, Business, Labor, and Public Policy 1860–1897'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased mechanization of industry and improvements to worker efficiency, increased the productivity of factories while undercutting the need for skilled labor. Mechanical innovations such as batch and continuous processing began to become much more prominent in factories. This mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. In some cases, the advancement of such mechanization substituted for low-skilled workers altogether. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hovey Calhoun, ''The American Civil Engineer: Origins and Conflicts'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment distribution ===
In the early 1900s there was a disparity between the levels of employment seen in the northern and southern United States. On average, states in the North had both a higher population, and a higher rate of employment than states in the South. The higher rate of employment is easily seen by considering the 1909 rates of employment compared to the populations of each state in the 1910 census. This difference was most notable in the states with the largest populations, such as New York and Pennsylvania. Each of these states had roughly 5 percent more of the total US workforce than would be expected given their populations. Conversely, the states in the South with the best actual rates of employment, North Carolina and Georgia, had roughly 2 percent less of the workforce than one would expect from their population. When the averages of all southern states and all northern states are taken, the trend holds with the North over-performing by about 2 percent, and the South under-performing by about 1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Steuart, William M. Abstract of the Census of Manufactures, 1914 .. Washington: Govt. Print. Off., 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Empire]] came to rival Britain as Europe's primary industrial nation during this period. Since Germany industrialized later, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. The German [[Concern (business)|concern]] system (known as ''Konzerne''), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.  Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry and O'Rourke (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 the German chemical industry dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]]. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913 these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs, and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.  The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrochemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]]. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers, leading Chandler to call the German dye companies "the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1990) p 474-5&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many spin offs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Burhop, "Pharmaceutical Research in Wilhelmine Germany: the Case of E. Merck," ''Business History Review''. Volume: 83. Issue: 3. 2009. pp 475+. in [[ProQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] during the [[Belle Époque]] showed the value of the [[History of rail transport|railways]] for speeding the Second Industrial Revolution. After 1830, when it [[Belgian Revolution|broke away from the Netherlands]] and became a new nation, it decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cruciform system that connected major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. [[History of rail transport in Belgium|The system]] was soundly built along British lines, so that profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O’Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative uses==
There have been other times that have been called "second industrial revolution". Industrial revolutions may be renumbered by taking earlier developments, such as the rise of [[medieval technology]] in the 12th century, or of ancient Chinese technology during the [[Tang Dynasty]], or of [[ancient Roman technology]], as first. "Second industrial revolution" has been used in the popular press and by technologists or industrialists to refer to the changes following the spread of new technology after [[World War I]].

Excitement and debate over the dangers and benefits of the [[Atomic Age]] were more intense and lasting than those over the [[Space age]] but both were predicted to lead to another industrial revolution. At the start of the [[21st century]]&lt;ref&gt;google.com&lt;/ref&gt; the term "second industrial revolution" has been used to describe the anticipated effects of hypothetical [[molecular nanotechnology]] systems upon society. In this more recent scenario, they would render the majority of today's modern manufacturing processes obsolete, transforming all facets of the modern economy.

The '''Shania Twain Centre''' was a city-owned [[tourist attraction]] that operated in [[Timmins]], [[Ontario]] from 2001 to 2013. It exhibited  memorabilia, [[Shania Twain awards|awards]] and other personal items loaned to the Centre by singer [[Shania Twain]], who was raised in Timmins.

==History==

The Shania Twain Centre was opened on June 30, 2001.

[[Image:Nov2resize019.jpg|thumb|right|Twain, on Nov. 2, 2005, at homecoming in Timmins, Ontario.]]

On November 2, 2004, Twain visited the Centre and officially declared it open before an audience of hundreds of fans from around the world, some of whom had queued for up to 20 hours for the opportunity of an autograph and greeting with Twain.

===Annual fan conventions===
From 2003 to 2012, fans of Shania Twain traveled to Timmins for the International Shania Twain Fan Convention. 32 fans attended the inaugural fan convention in 2003.  Attendance peaked at approximately 100 for the four-day event in 2005.

At subsequent conventions held each August:
* 2004: Two large gifts from Twain to the Centre were unveiled:  the stage from her "Up" tour and her tour bus. Twain band members  Cory Churko and JD Blair attended the convention.
* 2005: 100 fans attended the third convention. Drummer JD Blair and guitarist Randall Waller participated.
* 2006: Drummer JD Blair and fiddler Allison Cornell attended.
* 2007: 50 fans attended. Events included a karaoke night, a country party, a mini-golf tournament and Go-cart races. Drummer JD Blair and guitarist Randall Waller sent messages.
* 2008-2012: conventions were held annually. Visitors at the 2011 convention included fans from the U.K., Denmark, and the U.S.

===Costs to the city===
Annual attendance for the Centre was originally projected at 50,000 but never reached above 15,000.&lt;ref name=national /&gt; Annual subsidies to the center cost the city of Timmins $7 per resident, or $33.72 per centre visitor.&lt;ref name=national /&gt;  A 2011 financial study suggested that the city council faced either closing the centre or spending $233,000 per year subsidizing its operations.&lt;ref name=national /&gt; 

===Closing===
In May 2012, Shania Twain's management company had the singer's items repatriated to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], removing most of the Centre's exhibits.&lt;ref name=national /&gt;   In January 2013, Timmins city officials announced plans to sell the Centre building due to declining attendance.&lt;ref name=aube&gt;{{cite news

      <comment>/* Ancient Shona Music */That isn't true. There was no citation because there never will be one. That group, as talented as they are, is a modern adaptation, playing differently tuned mbira across different octaves is a modern phenomenon, or very rare in traditional music at best... certainly not a notable example of the ancient music.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6777">'''Shona music''' is the [[music]] of the [[Shona people]] of [[Zimbabwe]]. There are several different types of traditional Shona music including [[mbira]], [[singing]], [[Hosho (instrument)|hosho]] and [[drum (musical instrument)|drumming]].  Very often, this music will be accompanied by [[dance|dancing]], and participation by the audience.  In Shona music, there is little distinction between the performer and the audience, both are often actively involved in the music-making, and both are important in the religious ceremonies where Shona Music is often heard.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Mbira==
[[Image:Mbira dzavadzimu.jpg|thumb|An [[Mbira#Mbira dzavadzimu|Mbira Dzavadzimu]]]]
{{Main|Mbira}}

The mbira is a traditional instrument of the Shona People often used in religious ceremonies.  There are several different varieties of mbira including the [[Mbira#Mbira dzavadzimu|Mbira Dzavadzimu]] and [[Mbira#Mbira Nyunga Nyunga|Mbira Nyunga Nyunga]].

Shona music is well known as representative of mbira ("thumb piano") music. The performer of the "[[kushaura]]" (lead mbira part) often acts also as the lead vocalist, selecting a known melody or mbira pattern to accompany selected lyrics, usually a phrase or a few lines of text which are then commented upon improvisationally. The performer of the "kutsinira" (second mbira part) plays a pattern which interlocks with the "kushaura" in a way that creates the repeated notes which identify mbira music. The "kutsinira" part is sometimes the same part as the "kushaura", but following the kushaura one pulse behind. The mbira players are accompanied by another less active singer who plays the [[hosho (instrument)|hosho]] (a rattle) and responds to the improvised lyrics of the singer and, most importantly, embellishes and complements the lead vocal melody. (Garfias 1971){{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Drumming==
Drums are always associated with dance and can be used for various dances.

===Mhande Drums===
# [[Shauro]]- used for the lead rhythm
# [[Tsinhiro]]- used for the response rhythm

===Dinhe Drums===
# [[Mhito]]- used for the lead rhythm
# [[Mitumba miviri]]- used for the response rhythm

===Chokoto Drums===
(these are two headed)
# [[Chimudumbana]]- small, for lead rhythm
# [[Chigubha]]- big, for response rhythm

==Hosho==
[[Image:Hosho instrument.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[Hosho (instrument)|Hosho]]]]
{{Main|Hosho (instrument)}}

Shona music is often accompanied by the '''[[Hosho (instrument)|hosho]]''', a hollowed-out maranka gourd containing ''hota'' seeds or other objects that is shaken to generate a sound.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

== Ancient Shona Music ==
Traditional ancient Shona musics consist of [[Mbira dzavadzimu]] played by multiple players, [[Hosho (instrument)|Hosho]] and [[Ngoma drums]].Ancient shona music is mainly played at spiritual ceremonies called Bira.

==Modern==
Traditional Shona music has been adapted to modern instruments such as electric guitars and western drumsets, for example by musicians such as [[Thomas Mapfumo]], [[Stella Chiweshe]], and [[Oliver Mtukudzi]]. This music is also associated with the [[Chimurenga]] movement.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Shona music in the West==
Shona music has become popular in the West and even in the East such as Japan.  In the United States, Shona music has become popular in Colorado, California, the Pacific Northwest and in some places of Argentina, largely due to the seeding influence of musicians such as [[Dumisani Maraire]], [[Ephat Mujuru]], Thomas Mapfumo and [[Erica Azim]].{{cn|date =October 2017}}

===Shona music on Marimba===
Shona marimbas are diatonic and are made with F#'s and without. They are different from other marimbas through their larger keys and resonators beneath the keys (to produce a buzzing sound). Often traditional mbira songs are translated to the marimba.

[[File:SongOfTheEarth.jpg|thumb|First edition  (publ. [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]])]]
'''''Song of the Earth''''' is a novel by [[Alexander Cordell]], first published in 1969.  It is the final book of Cordell's "Mortymer Trilogy".

The novel is Cordell's third book in the lives of the Mortymer family, after ''Rape of the Fair Country'' and ''Hosts of Rebecca''. It tells of the Evan family buying a canal barge on the [[Neath Canal|Neath valley canal]]. There they meet Mari Mortymer and her adopted daughter Rhiannon. It tells of the coal industry in [[Resolven]] as well as the [[Brunel]] designed Canal system of the valley. It describes the landscape of the area (still viewable today over 150 years later) as well as the hardship suffered by the family, and growth of disease and population topography in the industrial revolution.

Cordell's third book in the lives of Mortymer family switches its focus to the canals and waterways of South Wales, especially the Neath Valley. The narrator is Bryn Evan, son of Mostyn and he describes how he, his Father and the Evan family take delivery of a new barge as owner/operators. They struggle to maintain a working existence against the onslaught of the new railways then under construction and being forged by the inspired engineering skills of Isambard Kingdom Brunel which are penetrating the valleys of South Wales. Against this backdrop, Mostyn marries Marie Mortymer who also appears in 'Rape of the Fair Country' and 'The Hosts of Rebecca'.

Time passes and the family have to accept the inevitable that the canals are failing, so they move to Aberdare to work in the pits and experience the grinding poverty and the everyday struggle of the Miners working the coalfields of the middle period of the 19th. Century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6085">'''Space psychology''' refers to applying psychology to advise [[human spaceflight]]. This includes applying [[industrial and organizational psychology]] to team selection, individual and team mental preparation, team training, and ongoing psychological support,&lt;ref&gt;Freiberg, Peter. (1998). "Psychology keeps astronauts well grounded."''Monitor'', ''American Psychological Association'', March Edition, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and applying [[human factors and ergonomics]] to the construction of [[spacecraft]] to ensure sufficient [[habitability]].

==Components of industrial/organizational psychology==
The field is necessary for planning for and accomplishing successful [[human spaceflight]] missions by ensuring readiness for the unique physiological and psychological challenges posed by spending extended time in closed isolated environments like spacecraft. It is critical that each team member functions individually and as a team in order to avoid [[human error]], overcome unforeseeable challenges, and complete the mission. 
Due to the importance of team reliance on mission success, the field has focused on [[team composition and cohesion in spaceflight missions]] ever since 1957's [[Project Mercury]]. This involves applying and conducting research from [[social psychology]], [[group dynamics]], group performance and team psychology, and applying it to select team members that will be able to live together in close quarters for an extended amount of time, and create team training programs that improve team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Novotney, Amy. (2013). "I/O psychology goes to Mars" ''Monitor on Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to [[teamwork]], there is an assortment of [[psychological and sociological effects of spaceflight]] that needs to be addressed in order to plan for successful space missions, such as [[loneliness]], unavailability of familial [[mental health]] support, elevated levels of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] due to demanding tasks, and reduced material comforts.

==Components of human factors and ergonomics==
To ensure [[habitability]] of constructed [[spacecraft]], [[human factors and ergonomics]] specialists must advise on environmental requirements such as lighting, room layout and design, sound requirements, and solutions for the physiological challenges posed by being in an environment without gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmire, Alexandra. (2014). "The Use of Psychology to Inform the Design of Future Space Vehicles and Habitats". ''American Psychological Association Convention Presentation''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Factor in space has to deal not only with adapting to different physical habitats, but also to different social habitats and different communication settings. New activities such as performing human extravehicular activity (EVA) beyond the low Earth orbit environment require complex synchronization methods. The ergonomic approach to these environments has to include new variables, such as time delay in communication due to speed of light transmission limitations. Astronauts will become increasingly isolated from Earth-based mission support and thus will rely heavily on their own decision-making capabilities and onboard tools to accomplish proposed EVA mission objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Matthew|title=Information flow model of human extravehicular activity operations|journal=IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings 2015|date=June 2015|doi=10.1109/AERO.2015.7118942|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282954950_Information_flow_model_of_human_extravehicular_activity_operations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Most published research specific to space psychology has been conducted by [[NASA]]s [[Human Systems Integration Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Barrett. (2006). "Group Performance and space flight teams: Chapter 8" in Bowers, Salas and Jentsch. (2006). "Creating High-Tech Teams: Practical Guidance on Work Performance and Technology." ''American Psychological Association''&lt;/ref&gt; Tests conducted to ensure team success include putting a team in an airtight quarters on earth for an extended period of time, such as in the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/ground/1.3Crewmembers.pdf Nasa Lunar-Mars Life Support Test]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the context of space flight, teamwork is an essential ingredient in successful missions. A variety of adverse influences may negatively impact the performance of mission teams both on the ground and in flight. Such influences may include physical stressors on the organism such as diurnal disruption, effects of microgravity, injury, or task overload as well as psychological factors such as social isolation, role overload, or interpersonal conflict among team members. Given the importance of team effectiveness, NASA’s Behavioral Health and Performance Element (BHP) has identified a need to monitor the functioning of teams, primarily using unobtrusive means. The purpose of such monitoring lies in providing a stream of indicators that can serve several operational goals:
# Monitoring during personnel selection activities can provide input for the selection of compatible team members and of individuals with psychological profiles suited to teamwork in extreme environments and situations.
# Monitoring during training activities can provide diagnostic information useful in guiding further instruction and coaching as well as in determining the composition of teams prior to mission deployment.
# Monitoring during missions can provide forewarning of potential operational failures due to disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Maidel, &amp; Jeffrey M. Stanton (2010), ''Unobtrusive Monitoring of Spaceflight Team Functioning. Literature Review and Operational Assessment for NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Element''. School of Information Studies, Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{political anthropology}}
'''State formation''' is the process of the development of a centralized government structure in a situation where one did not exist prior to its development.  State formation has been a study of many disciplines of the [[social science]]s for a number of years, so much so that Jonathan Haas writes that "One of the favorite pastimes of social scientists over the course of the past century has been to theorize about the evolution of the world's great civilizations."{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=1}} The study of state formation is divided generally into either the study of early states (those that developed in [[Stateless society|stateless societies]]) or the study of modern states (particularly of the form that developed in Europe in the 17th century and spread around the world). Academic debate about various theories is a prominent feature in fields like Anthropology, Sociology, Economics and Political Science.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=523}}

==The state==
{{main|State (polity)}}
A state is a political system with a centralized government, a military force, a civil service, an arranged society, and literacy. Though, there is no clear agreement on the defining characteristics of a state and the definition can vary significantly, based upon the focus of the particular definition.{{sfn|Haas|1982|pp=2-3}} The state is considered to be territoriality bound and is distinct from tribes or units without centralized institutions.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=2-5}}

According to Painter &amp; Jeffrey, there are 5 distinctive features of the modern state:

1) They are ordered by precise boundaries with administrative control across the whole;

2) They occupy large territories with control given to organized institutions;

3) They have a capital city and are endowed with symbols that embody state power;

4) The government within state creates organizations to monitor, govern and control its population through surveillance and record keeping;

5) They increase monitoring over time.{{sfn|Painter|Jeffrey|2009|pp=22-24}}

Additionally, Herbst holds that there is another relevant characteristic of modern states: [[nationalism]]. This feeling of belonging to a certain territory plays a central role in state formation since it increases citizens' willingness to pay taxes.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

==Explaining early states and explaining modern states==
Theories of state formation have two distinct focuses, depending largely on the field of study:

# The early transition in human society from tribal communities into larger political organizations.  Studies of this topic, often in [[anthropology]], explore the initial development of basic administrative structures in areas where states developed from stateless societies.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=129}} Although state formation was an active research agenda in anthropology and archaeology until the 1980s, some of the effort has changed to focus not on why these states formed but on how they operated.{{sfn|Marcus|Feinman|1998|p=3}} 
# In contrast, studies in [[political science]] and in [[sociology]] have focused significantly on the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=131}}

Sandeford as socially stratified and bureaucratically governed societies with at least four levels of settlement hierarchy (e.g., a large capital, cities, villages, and hamlets). Primary states are those state societies that developed in regions where no states existed before. These states developed by strictly internal processes and interaction with other non-states societies.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}} The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places,{{sfn|Wright|1977|p=386}} but Sandeford lists ten likely cases of primary state formation in Eurasia, the Americas, and the Pacific.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}}

Studies on the formation of '''early states''' tend to focus on processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations]] and the [[Malagasy culture#Madagascar|Malagasy civilization in Madagascar]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=306}} Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=50}}

===Modern state formation===
Theories on the formation of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread around the world with colonialism. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with [[decolonization]] processes underway, attention began to focus on the formation and construction of modern states with significant bureaucracies, ability to tax, and territorial sovereignty around the world.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=153}}{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=132}} However, some scholars hold that the modern state model formed in other parts of the world prior to colonialism, but that colonial structures replaced it.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=13}}

==Theories about early state development==
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.{{sfn|Spencer|Redmond|2004|p=174}}

===Voluntary theories===
[[File:City context.svg|thumb|right|Uruk one of the prime sites for research into early state formation]]
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.  The argument is that such pressures result in integrative pressure for rational people to unify and create a state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=21}} Much of the [[social contract]] philosophical tradition proposed a voluntary theory for state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=21-23}}

One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the ''hydraulic hypothesis'', which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}} The theory was most significantly detailed [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}}

In addition to this, is what Carneiro calls the ''automatic hypothesis'', which contends that the development of agriculture easily produces conditions necessary for the development of a state. With surplus food stocks created by agricultural development, creation of distinct worker classes and a division of labor would automatically trigger creation of the state form.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}}

A third voluntary hypothesis, particularly common with some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus for states to develop at key locations: such as ports or oases. For example, the increased trade in the 16th century may have been a key to state formation in West African states such as [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], [[Dahomey]], and the [[Benin Empire]].{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Conflict theories===
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}} In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or oppression as a causal process or as a necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: ''economic stratification'', ''conquest of other peoples'', conflict in ''circumscribed areas'', and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy. 
[[File:Panorama of Monte Alban from the South Platform.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Panorama of Monte Albán in present-day Mexico, seen from the South Platform. Archeologists oftentimes look for evidence of such "large-scale construction projects, trade networks, and religious systems" to identify early states.{{sfn|Haas|1981|p=82}}]]

:*'''''Economic stratification'''''
:: [[Friedrich Engels]] articulated one of the earliest theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884).{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=6}} The theory of Engels developed from study of ''Ancient Society'' (1877) by [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and from the sketches of this work by [[Karl Marx]] on the [[Asiatic mode of production]].{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=25-26}} Engels argues that the state developed as a result of the need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes who worked the land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=7}} The anthropologist [[Morton Fried]] (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}}

:*'''''Conquest theories'''''
:: Similar to the economic stratification theories, the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered. The theory has its roots in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) and of [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] (1864-1943).{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Gross|1999|p=5}} Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=10}}

:*'''''Carneiro's circumscription theory'''''
[[File:Macchupicchu.jpg|thumb|right|The mountain [[Huayna Picchu]] overlooks the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]]. The [[Andes]] mountains circumscribed much of the region.]] 
:{{main|Carneiro's circumscription theory}}
::[[Robert Carneiro]] developed a theory (1970){{sfn|Carneiro|1970}} aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of state formation by accounting for the fact that many factors (surplus agriculture, warfare, irrigation, conquest, etc.) did not produce states in all situations. He concluded that while population pressure and warfare were mechanisms of state formation, they only created states in geographic regions circumscribed, or walled off from the surrounding area.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=13}} Geographic barriers (or in some cases barriers created by nomadic raiders or by rival societies) create limitations on the ability of the people to deal with production shortfalls, and the result is that warfare results in state creation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}} In situations of unlimited agricultural land (like the Amazon or the Eastern United States), Carneiro believes that the pressures did not exist and so warfare allowed people to move elsewhere and thus did not spur creation of a state.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|pp=734-735}}

:*'''''Neoevolutionary theories'''''
:{{further|Neoevolutionism}}
::A number of different theories, sometimes connected with some of the processes above, explain state formation in terms of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[leadership]] systems. This argument sees human society as evolving from [[tribe]]s or [[chiefdom]]s into states through a gradual process of transformation that lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of [[symbol]]s of power.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=8}} Groups that gained power in tribal society gradually worked towards building the hierarchy and segmentation that created the state.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=9}}

::[[Elman Service]] (1915-1996) proposed that, unlike in economic stratification theories, the state largely creates stratification in society rather than being created to defend that stratification.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=38}} Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and economic stratification as a means to further increase its power.{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=73}} Warfare may play a key role in the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=51}} Similarly, anthropologist [[Henry T. Wright]] argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=316}}

===Other theories===
Other aspects are highlighted in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members are crucial to state development. However, most of these factors are found to be secondary in anthropological analysis.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=61-68}} In addition to conquest, some theories contend that the need for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Discredited theories===
Some theories proposed in the 19th century and early 20th century have since been largely discredited by anthropologists. Carneiro writes that theories "with a racial basis, for example, are now so thoroughly discredited that they need not be dealt with...We can also reject the belief that the state is an expression of the 'genius' of a people, or that it arose through a 'historical accident.' Such notions make the state appear to be something metaphysical or adventitious, and thus place it beyond scientific understanding."{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} Similarly, [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] perspectives like those of [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''Physics and Politics'' argued that the state form developed as a result of the best leaders and organized societies gradually gaining power until a state resulted. Such explanations are not considered sufficient to explain the formation of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=42}}

==Theories about modern state development==
In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] (500-1400) in Europe, there were a variety of authority forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} Often dated to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], there began to be the development in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} The state became prominent in Europe over the next few centuries before the particular form of the state spread to the rest of the world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=535}} Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=12}}

Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began studying the state formation processes in Europe and elsewhere in the 17th century—beginning significantly with [[Max Weber]]. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=525}} A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}  The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about [[State-building]]. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=8}}

Based on the model of European states, it has been commonly assumed that development is the natural path that states will eventually walk through. However, Herbst holds that in the case African states, as well as in developing countries of other regions, development need not be the natural step. States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

===Warfare theories===
[[File:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A woodcut of the [[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618—which began the [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the Peace of Westphalia that started the recognition of the modern state]]

Two related theories are based on military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. [[Charles Tilly]] developed an argument that the state developed largely as a result of "state-makers" who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states.{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=170}} In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war  and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527-528}} Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]] emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid.{{sfn|Kaldor|1963}} Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy."{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=169}}

[[Michael Roberts (historian)|Michael Roberts]] and [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], in contrast, finds that the primary causal factor was not the "state-makers" themselves, but simply the military revolutions that allowed development of larger armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=5}} The argument is that with the expanded state of warfare, the state became the only administrative unit that could endure in the constant warfare in the Europe of this period, because only it could develop large enough armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=6}} 
This view—that the modern state replaced chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, and ignoring the violence of modern states.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=19}}

War has played a key role not only in the consolidation of European states but also of some third world states. According to Herbst, external security threats have had a fundamental role in the development of the [[South Korea]]n and [[Taiwan]]ese states.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}} A 2017 study which tests the predictions of warfare theories of Tilly and others found that the predictions do not match the empirical record.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The study found that median state size decreased from 1100 to 1800, and that the number of states increases rapidly between the twelfth and thirteen centuries and remained constant until 1800.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Commerce theories===
[[Stein Rokkan]] and others have argued that the modern territorial state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial "city belt" ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The existence of prosperous urban centers that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The elites in those urban centers could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other urban centers to sustain their independence. A lower density of urban centers in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Feudal crisis theories===
Another argument contends that the state developed out of economic and social crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} In addition, Marxist theory contends that the economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted in the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=529}}

===Cultural theories===
Some scholarship, linked to wider debates in Anthropology, has increasingly emphasized the state as a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=9}} Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then is not simply a military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}

===Outside Europe===
While modern states existed without European influence around the world before colonialism,{{sfn|Ejogu|2011|p=595}} post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, the development of the international norm of [[non-interventionism]] means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal political processes.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=531}}{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} [[John W. Meyer|John W. Meyer's]] ''World Society Theory'' contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}} In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}}

}}'''Stellenbosch University''' ({{lang-af|Universiteit Stellenbosch}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] situated in [[Stellenbosch]], a town in the [[Western Cape]] province of South Africa. Stellenbosch is jointly the oldest university in South Africa and the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest extant university in Sub-Saharan Africa]] alongside the [[University of Cape Town]] which received full university status on the same day in 1918. Stellenbosch University (abbreviated as SU) designed and manufactured Africa's first microsatellite, [[SUNSAT]], launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/sunsat|title=SUNSAT - eoPortal Directory - Satellite Missions|website=directory.eoportal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stellenbosch University was the first African university to sign the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10019.1/4828|title=Signing of the Berlin Declaration by Prof Russel Botman, Rector and Vice-Chancellor of the Stellenbosch University|first=Botman, H.|last=Russel|date=20 October 2010|website=handle.net|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The students of Stellenbosch University are nicknamed "Maties". The term probably arises from the Afrikaans word "tamatie" (meaning tomato, and referring to the maroon sport uniforms and blazer colour). An alternative theory is that the term comes from the Afrikaans colloquialism ''maat'' (meaning "buddy" or "mate") originally used diminutively ("maatjie") by the students of the [[University of Cape Town]]'s precursor, the [[South African College]].

Stellenbosch University is the second-highest ranked African University according to the 2017-2018 [[QS World University Rankings]]. 

== History ==
The origin of the university can be traced back to the '''Stellenbosch Gymnasium''', which was founded in 1864 and opened on 1 March 1866. The first five students matriculated in 1870, but capacity did not initially exist for any tertiary education. However, in the 1870s the Cape Colony's first locally elected government took office and prioritised education. In 1873, four of the five 1870 matriculants became the institution's first graduates by attaining the "Second Class Certificate" through distance learning, and the gymnasium's student numbers rose to over a hundred.

In 1874, a series of government acts provided for colleges and universities, with generous subsidies and staff. A personal intervention by the Prime Minister in the same year ensured that Stellenbosch qualified, after initially being allocated to be purely a secondary school. Later in 1874, the institution acquired its first Professor and in the coming few years its capacity and staff grew rapidly. Its first academic senate was constituted at the beginning of 1876, when several new premises were also acquired. The first MA degree (in Stellenbosch and in South Africa) was completed in 1878, and also in that year, the Gymnasium's first four female students were enrolled.&lt;ref name="Smuts"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stellenbosch.

[[File:Stellenbosch Ou Hoofgebou.jpg|thumb|322x322px|The ''Ou Hoofgebou'' (Former Main Administration building, now the Law Faculty) on Stellenbosch University campus]]
The institution became the '''Stellenbosch College''' in 1881 and was located at the current Arts Department. 
In 1887 this college was renamed '''[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] College'''; when it acquired university status on 2 April 1918 it was renamed once again, to '''Stellenbosch University'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/place/stellenbosch-university|title=Stellenbosch University|last=Nolundi|date=2017-05-04|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially only one university was planned for the Cape but after the government was visited by a delegation from the '''Victoria College''', it was decided to allow the college to be a university if it could raise £100,000.&lt;ref name="Pretorius"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of South Africa: From the Distant Past to the Present Day | publisher=Protea Book House | author=Pretorius, Fransjohan | year=2014 | location=Hatsfield, Pretoria | isbn=978-1-86919-908-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290–1}} [[Jannie Marais]], a wealthy Stellenbosch farmer, bequeathed the money required before his death in 1915.&lt;ref name=Pretorius/&gt;{{rp|291}} There were certain conditions to his gift which included Dutch/Afrikaans having equal status to English and that the lecturers teach at least half their lectures in Dutch/Afrikaans. By 1930, very little, if any, tuition was in English.&lt;ref name=Pretorius/&gt;{{rp|291}}

In December 2014, specialists at the university performed the first successful [[penis transplantation]] on a 21-year-old man.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31876219 | title=South Africans perform first 'successful' penis transplant | work=BBC News | date=13 March 2015 | accessdate=15 March 2015 | author=Gallagher, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:UniStellenbosch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|View over the "Red Square" of Stellenbosch University with the peak,"The Twins" beyond]]
[[Stellenbosch]] is located about 50 kilometres from Cape Town and is situated on the banks of the ''Eersterivier'' ("First River") in the famous wine-growing region and is encircled by picturesque mountains. Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided between the main campus in Stellenbosch, the Tygerberg campus (where the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences is situated), the [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville Park]] campus (where the [[University of Stellenbosch Business School]] (USB) is situated), and the [[Saldanha Bay|Saldanha]] campus (housing the Faculty of Military Science at the Military Academy of the South African National Defence Force).

== Language ==
Stellenbosch University used to be a predominantly [[Afrikaans]]-medium university. However, as the student body became more diversified, pressure mounted for more classes in English. 

Today, the university's Language Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/language|title=Language at Stellenbosch University|website=www.sun.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; promotes multilingualism as a means to increase equitable access for all students and staff. Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa are used in academic, administrative, professional and social contexts, and classes are offered in Afrikaans and English.

Students are allowed to write their assignments, tests and examinations in English or Afrikaans. The language of tuition also varies depending on the faculty. The Faculty of Arts for example, is 40% English, so courses are lectured bilingually and the language of most handouts or prescribed material is determined by the student.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

At postgraduate level the language of tuition is determined by the composition of the class. Most advanced postgraduate courses are conducted in English. According to the 2016 language profile of the university, 40.7% of its students stated Afrikaans as their home language, 46.1% stated English, 0.9% stated English and Afrikaans, and 3.1% of students stated [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]] as their home language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/english/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/english/Documents/Statistics/2016/Statistiese%20Profiel%202016%20-%20Tabel%206.xlsx&amp;action=default|title=Statistiese Profiel 2016 - Tabel 6.xlsx|website=www.sun.ac.za|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language policy is still an ongoing issue for the University, since it is one of the very few tertiary institutions left in South Africa still offering tuition in Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Afrique-du-Sud-Stellenbosch-bastion-de-l-ombre-de-l-apartheid_a1180.html  |title=Afrique du Sud : Stellenbosch, bastion de l’ombre de l’apartheid |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2015-12-20 |language=French |author=Arthur Cerf |newspaper=Le Journal International}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in the Western Cape province, where 67% of the population have Afrikaans as home language, and the only one of four universities in the province to offer degree courses in Afrikaans. Due to this, it is held in high regard by the Afrikaner community.

The University annually hosts the SU ''Woordfees'', a predominantly Afrikaans-language festival of the written and spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=4497|title=News - SU Woordfees launches its 2017 programme...|website=www.sun.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Matieland''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/english/matieland/Pages/default.aspx|title=Home|website=www.sun.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of the official alumni magazine. It is published twice a year and distributed to some 100 000 alumni and friends of the University.

== Sport ==
Sports facilities for the more than 30 competitive and recreational sports that are supported by the university include [[Danie Craven Stadium]], two large swimming pools (one under roof), the Coetzenburg Centre, a multi-purpose center for ceremonies and indoor sports, numerous playing fields, including two artificial hockey fields, a gymnasium and a new football complex.

Stellenbosch has served as a test site in 2006 for a set of proposed modifications to the rules of [[rugby union]], commonly referred to as the [[Stellenbosch Laws]].

==Student housing==
[[File:Dagbreek lug.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of the Dagbreek student residence hall at Stellenbosch University.]]
Stellenbosch has 34 [[Dormitory|residence halls]] in configurations for women only, men only and mixed gender. Each residence is supervised by a warden assisted by a House Committee of senior students. The House Committee assists students with security, maintenance, and social programs. Each residence incorporates a laundry room and a common living room. Residences for women have a communal lounge while several men's residences include a pub.

The number of available rooms in university residences is limited, which requires some students to find private boarding. Students in private lodgings can join the Private Students' Organisation (PSO), also known as Private Wards. There are 6 PSO wards, and a student is assigned to one according to the location of their lodgings in Stellenbosch. Students who commute to the university are assigned to one of two mixed-gender wards. As of 2008, four new PSO wards had been commissioned. The oldest residence is Wilgenhof men's residence, established in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www0.sun.ac.za/willows/|title=Wilgenhof Manskoshuis|website=www0.sun.ac.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSO wards are grouped into six clusters with nearby residences to form student communities (a seventh cluster is on the Tygerberg campus)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www0.sun.ac.za/ssg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=529&amp;lang=en|title=Clusters|first=Mathew|last=Smorenburg|date=|website=www0.sun.ac.za|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For each of these clusters, a hub facility is being built, of which two have already been completed, namely amaMaties and Wimbledon. In this way, day students can enjoy the same benefits as residence students, such as mentor support, meals and a well-appointed place to go to between classes.

A '''thermal vacuum chamber''' is a [[vacuum chamber]] in which the [[Radiation|radiative]] thermal environment is controlled.

Typically the thermal environment is achieved by passing [[liquid]]s or [[fluid]]s through thermal shrouds for cold [[temperature]]s or through the application of thermal [[Lamp (fixture)|lamps]] for high [[temperature]]s.

Thermal vacuum chambers are frequently used for testing [[spacecraft]] or parts thereof under a simulated [[Outer space|space]] environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">The '''Undervoltage-Lockout''' or '''UVLO''' is an [[electronic circuit]] used to turn off the power of an electronic device in the event of the [[voltage]] dropping below the operational value. For instance, in [[embedded device]]s, UVLOs can be used to monitor the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] charge or turn off the circuit if the battery voltage drops below a specific threshold, thus protecting the associated equipment. Some variants may also have an upper threshold.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
Undervoltage lockout is an integral part of many electronic devices. For instance, it is widely used in many [[Electrical ballast]] circuits to switch them off in the event of voltage falling below the operational value.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Undervoltage-lockout should be used for [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] when the [[output impedance]] of an electrical network is higher than the input impedance of the [[voltage regulator|regulator]] in order to prevent oscillations and possible malfunctions of the regulator.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="SOKA73A"&gt; Sokal, N.

[[File:The New Testament in the original Greek - 1881.djvu|thumb|page=9]]
'''''The New Testament in the Original Greek''''' is a Greek-language version of the [[New Testament]] published in 1881. It is also known as the '''Westcott and Hort''' text, after its editors [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]] (1828–1892). (Textual scholars use the abbreviation "'''WH'''".&lt;ref&gt;

It is a [[Textual criticism|critical text]], compiled from some of the oldest New Testament fragments and texts that had been discovered at the time. The two editors worked together for 28 years.

Westcott and Hort state: "[It is] our belief that even among the numerous unquestionably spurious readings of the New Testament there are no signs of deliberate falsification of the text for dogmatic purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=0xtVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=ACfU3U33CMW3331Vv20NgGvjyOs52I1mlA&amp;vq=%22will+not+be+out+of+place+to+add+here+a+distinct+expression+of+our+belief+that+even+among+the+numerous%22&amp;source=gbs_quotes_r&amp;cad=2_0#PPA283,M1 'The New Testament in the Original Greek: Introduction, Appendix''], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; 
They find that without orthographic differences, doubtful textual variants exist only in one sixtieth of the whole New Testament (with most of them being comparatively trivial variations), with the substantial variations forming hardly more than one thousandth of the entire text.

According to Hort, "Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings". The two editors favoured two manuscripts: [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]]. They also believed that the combination of [[Codex Bezae]] with the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] and the [[Peshitta|Old Syriac]] represents the original form of the New Testament text, especially when it is shorter than other forms of the text, such as the majority of the [[Byzantine text-type]].&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book | last = Aland | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Aland |author2=[[Barbara Aland]] |translator=Erroll F.

&lt;/ref&gt; In this they followed one of the primary principles of their fledgling textual criticism, ''[[lectio brevior]]'', sometimes taken to an extreme, as in the theory of [[Western non-interpolations]], which has since been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Aland, Kurt and Barbara.

== WH edition ==
[[File:Wyh.jpg|thumb|[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]]]

Westcott and Hort distinguished four text types in their studies. The most recent is the Syrian, or [[Byzantine text-type]] (eastern), of which the newest example is the [[Textus Receptus]] and thus from the critical text view is less likely reliable. The [[Western text-type]] is much older, but tends to paraphrase, so according to the critical text view also lacks dependability. The [[Alexandrian text-type]], exemplified in the [[Codex Ephraemi]], exhibits a polished Greek style. The two scholars identified their favorite text type as "Neutral text", exemplified by two 4th-century manuscripts, the [[Codex Vaticanus]] (known to scholars since the 15th century), and the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (discovered in 1859), both of which they relied on heavily (albeit not exclusively) for this edition. This text has only a few changes of the original.&lt;ref name = Schumacher&gt;H. Schumacher, A Handbook of Scripture Study (B. Herder Book Co.: St. Louis-London 1923), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is based on the critical works especially of Tischendorf and Tregelles.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; The minuscules play a minimal role in this edition.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes, ''From Nestle to the `Editio Critica Maior`'', in: ''The Bible as Book: The Transmission of the Greek Text'', London 2003, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-7123-4727-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westcott and Hort worked on their Testament from 1853 until its completion in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

In 1892, a revised edition was released by [[Francis Crawford Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Reception ==

The edition of Westcott and Hort began a new epoch in the history of textual criticism.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; Most critical editions published after Westcott and Hort share their preference of the Alexandrian text-type and therefore are similar to ''The New Testament in the Original Greek''. An exception is the text edited by [[Hermann von Soden]]. Soden's edition stands much closer to the text of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]] than to the text of Westcott and Hort. All editions of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] remain close in textual character to the text WH. [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] reports that, while NA25 text shows, for example, 2,047 differences from von Soden, 1,996 from Vogels, 1,268 from Tischendorf, 1,161 from Bover, and 770 from Merk, it contains only 558 differences from WH text.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland &amp; B. Aland, ''Text of the New Testament'', pp. 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bruce M. Metzger]], "the general validity of their critical principles and procedures is widely acknowledged by scholars today."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1981 Metzger said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The international committee that produced the ''United Bible Societies'' Greek New Testament, not only adopted the Westcott and Hort edition as its basic text, but followed their methodology in giving attention to both external and internal consideration”.&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Metzger, cited by James Brooks, ''Bible Interpreters of the 20th century'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Comfort]] gave this opinion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The text produced by Westcott and Hort is still to this day, even with so many more manuscript discoveries, a very close reproduction of the primitive text of the New Testament. Of course, I think they gave too much weight to Codex Vaticanus alone, and this needs to be tempered. This criticism aside, the Westcott and Hort text is extremely reliable. (...) In many instances where I would disagree with the wording in the Nestle / UBS text in favor of a particular variant reading, I would later check with the Westcott and Hort text and realize that they had often come to the same decision. (...) Of course, the manuscript discoveries of the past one hundred years have changed things, but it is remarkable how often they have affirmed the decisions of Westcott and Hort.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Comfort, ''Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography &amp; Textual Criticism'', (Nashville, 2005), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other editions of Greek New Testament ==

The texts of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]], and of Bover and Merk, differ very little from the text of the Westcott-Hort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/TextTypes.html#Use Robert Waltz]&lt;/ref&gt;
