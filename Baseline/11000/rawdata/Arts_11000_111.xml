"'''(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar'''" is a 2009 [[song]] created and performed by the cast of the [[web series]] ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'', with lead vocals by [[Singing|singer]]-[[actress]] [[Felicia Day]]. The lyrics were written by Day and the music was written by musical composer [[Jed Whedon]], who also directed the music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
When interviewed at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], Day attributed her inspiration for the song to 1980s and 1990s-style [[dance music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Seize the Day | date = August 7, 2009 | work = [[GameTrailers]] | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/episode/gametrailers-tv/66?ch=3&amp;sd=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She conveyed an obsession with [[Stacey Q]]'s "[[Two of Hearts (song)|Two of Hearts]]" in particular, which is apparent with Day including a familiar ''"come on, come on"'' in the lyrics. The song includes a [[Rapping|rap]] portion performed by ''Guild'' co-stars [[Jeff Lewis (actor)|Jeff Lewis]] and [[Sandeep Parikh]].

While Day composed the lyrics herself, whilst listening to "really bad 1990s dance songs", she turned to screenwriter [[Jed Whedon]] (with whom she had worked on internet musical ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog]]'' and TV series ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'') to compose the music.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | title =  Cult web series tops iTunes chart | last = Savage | first = Mark | work = [[BBC News]] | date = August 21, 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8214023.stm | accessdate = August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whedon and his wife [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] are credited as backup singers on the video, and Tancharoen also contributes her talent as a back-up dancer; this was the first time Whedon (who also directed the video) had seen her dance.&lt;ref name=Digitalcity/&gt;

==Music video==
The music video features the entire cast of ''The Guild'' dressed up as their own online "[[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]" characters from the web series.

Day comments that "In a regular Hollywood situation it would have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars", but the video was recorded in Whedon's closet three weeks prior to its general release.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  Whedon stated that in directing the video (his first time "directing anything" according to his wife) he "basically wanted to do a relatively cliché dance video as if it were about medieval fantasy warriors who took themselves really seriously," in which respect he felt the cast delivered "perfectly and hilariously". He used [[stop motion]] techniques to compensate for those members of ''The Guild'' cast who do not have dancing skills. Then, to make it "legit" as a video, Whedon made sure to include "actual sexy footage of Felicia, stellar dancing with [[Amy Okuda|Amy [Okuda]]] showing off her chops, and of course, raining money."&lt;ref name=Digitalcity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalcity.com/2009/08/18/do-you-want-to-date-my-avatar-1-on-itunes-and-amazon/ |title='Do You Want To Date My Avatar' #1 on iTunes and Amazon |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |last=Milne |first=Carly |work=Digital City |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919185527/http://www.digitalcity.com/2009/08/18/do-you-want-to-date-my-avatar-1-on-itunes-and-amazon/ |archivedate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Lewis describes himself as "not good at anything at all - dancing or rap" and comments, "they were able to make what I did [the rap sequence] fairly entertaining". Lewis recorded four lines of rap at Jed's house which were later synced up to the video. He was told to dance or "do anything" for three minutes, which "felt really bad and embarrassing... awful" but was impressed when the footage was slowed down, and became "more than I anticipated or imagined in a music video."&lt;ref name=Digitalcity/&gt;

==Reception==
The video reached 1 million [[YouTube]] hits in less than 2 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Do You Wanna Date My Avatar’ Breaks 1M Views, #1 On iTunes, Amazon |last=Hustvedt |first=Marc |date=August 19, 2009 |work=[[Tubefilter|Tubefilter News]] |url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2009/08/19/do-you-wanna-date-my-avatar-breaks-1m-views-1-on-itunes |accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj809"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamin |last=Brophy-Warren |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |title=How the Web Series 'The Guild' Stays Successful |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203706604574371032925896794 |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actually, I do wanna date Felicia Day's avatar |last=Bridges |first=C.

On August 6, 2010 the song became a playable track on ''[[Rock Band 2]]'' via the [[Rock Band Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/offers/8000046f-0000-4000-8000-000045410869?cid=RockBandCom&amp;partner=RockBandCom |title=Full Song - "(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar" |publisher=Marketplace.xbox.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]] entertainment reporter Mark Savage describes the song as "[r]eminiscent of [[Ace of Base]]'s '[[All That She Wants]]'" and describes the rap by Jeff Lewis and Sandeep Parikh as "intricate and clearly masterful".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

TV writer, director and producer [[Joss Whedon]] (brother of composer Jed Whedon), who has worked with Day on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog|Dr. Horrible]]'' and ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'', gave his support for the song. On [[weblog]] [[Whedonesque.com]], Whedon implored his fanbase to support the video, saying "I really want this to be big. It's indie (which is the most important part), it's awesome... So help me out. Let's go the extra mile here and DESTROY THE [[Taylor Swift|SWIFTBOT]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whedonesque.com/comments/21340#334270 |title='(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar' Video Number One Video on iTunes!!!; comment by Joss |work=[[Whedonesque.com]] |date=August 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Cellier, H J Leslie, B C Stephenson.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Alfred Cellier]], H. J. Leslie and Stephenson, creators of ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'']]
'''Benjamin Charles Stephenson''' or '''B. C. Stephenson''' (1839 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1906) was an English dramatist, lyricist and librettist.  After beginning a career in the civil service, he started to write for the theatre, using the pen name "Bolton Rowe".  He was author or co-author of several long-running shows of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatre. His biggest hit was the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', which set records for the length of its original run.

His writing collaborators included [[Clement Scott]] and [[Brandon Thomas]], and composers with whom he worked included [[Frederic Clay]], [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] with whom he wrote ''[[The Zoo]]'', which continues to be revived today.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Stephenson, the son of Sir William Henry Stephenson, came from a family with a history of public service, both civil and military. His grandfather, also named [[Benjamin C. Stephenson|Benjamin Charles Stephenson]], was a [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] and later one of the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]].&lt;ref name=general&gt;"Obituary, Major-Gen. Sir B. C. Stephenson", ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Volume 12, July – December 1839, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The general had two sons, one of whom, Frederick, followed him into the army and rose to be a general.  See "Obituary, General Sir F. C. A. Stephenson", ''The Times'', 11 March 1911, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's father became a civil servant, rising to become chairman of the [[Inland Revenue|Board of Inland Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary, Sir William Henry Stephenson", ''The Times'', 2 March 1898, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The young Stephenson was commissioned into the Middlesex Militia&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Morning Post]]'', 31 October 1857, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and later entered the civil service.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;"Obituary, Mr. B. C. Stephenson", ''The Times'', 24 January 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a civil servant, Stephenson began writing theatrical pieces. His grandfather, General B. C. Stephenson, had lived and died at a house in Bolton Row, [[Mayfair]], and the young Stephenson adopted "Bolton Rowe" as his pen name.&lt;ref name=general/&gt; Stephenson's first works were collaborations with the composer [[Frederic Clay]] in three pieces played by amateurs, ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868).  The last of these was repeated at a benefit, produced by [[Thomas German Reed]], at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to Clay and [[W.S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Ages Ago]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's first professional success came at the same venue, two years later, with a short [[operetta]], written with the composer [[Alfred Cellier]], ''Charity Begins at Home''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was in the company's repertory for most of 1872, and was played more than 200 times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', 16 November 1872, p. 1; and "Dramatic and Musical Chronology for 1872", ''The Era'', 5 January 1873, supplement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson was still using the pseudonym "Bolton Rowe" when he wrote the libretto for [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s one-act [[comic opera]] ''[[The Zoo]]'' in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 6 June 1875, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This work is still played today with some frequency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e. g., [http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/archive/archive_agilbertandsullivandoublebill.htm this information about a 2007 Finborough production]; and Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine vol. 66, Winter 2007 p. 5 about the Charles Court Opera production first performed the same year.&lt;/ref&gt; He then began a writing partnership with [[Clement Scott]], who adopted the matching pen name, "Saville Rowe" (after [[Savile Row]], another Mayfair street).&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 24 September 1876, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Together, for the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]], they wrote English versions of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s plays, ''Nos intimes'' (as ''Peril'') and ''Dora'' (1878 as ''Diplomacy''). The latter was described by the theatrical paper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "the great dramatic hit of the season".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 23 June 1878, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also played with success at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 7 April 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Scott wrote an English version of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]] and [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]]'s libretto for [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s operette, ''Le Petit Duc''. Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 28 April 1878, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===West End and Broadway success===
In 1880, Stephenson's work again featured in New York.  The reopened Broadway Opera House was inaugurated with a double bill of ''Ages Ago'' and ''Charity Begins at Home''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 28 March 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson also supplied the libretto for a three-act [[grand opera]] version of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''The Masque of Pandora'', composed by Alfred Cellier, and presented in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 1 August 1880, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The next year in London, Stephenson collaborated with [[Brandon Thomas]] on a "new and critical comedy", ''Comrades'', for the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], with a cast including [[Arthur Cecil]], [[Dion Boucicault Jr.|D. G. Boucicault]] and [[Marion Terry]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 December 1882, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Writing under his real name for the first time, Stephenson had a great success in 1882–83 with his play ''Impulse'', based on ''La Maison du mari'' by [[Xavier de Montépin]], which opened in December 1882 and ran through most of the next year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 December 1882, p. 6; and 18 September 1883, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he adapted ''Der Probepfeil'' by [[Oscar Blumenthal]] as ''A Woman of the World'', which was staged at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], starring [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Helen Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le Follet: Journal du Grand Monde'', 1 February 1886, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Stephenson had his greatest success. He and Cellier wrote the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''.  The piece opened at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] on 25 September 1886, receiving lukewarm notices.  Much of Cellier's score was reused material from an earlier failure, and neither the music nor the libretto attracted critical praise. ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 September 1886, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Cellier revised the work, and it transferred in December to the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] with new stars, including [[Marie Tempest]].   ''Dorothy'' became a great success at the box office and transferred in 1888 to the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], where it ran until 1889.  Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Gillan, Don.  [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html Longest Running Plays in London and New York, 1875 to 1920] at the Stage Beauty website (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece,&lt;ref&gt;"Dorothy", ''The Times'', 22 December 1908, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights [[David Garrick]] and [[Aphra Behn]], and to [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and even [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', 23 July 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Cellier later collaborated on another comic opera, ''[[Doris (opera)|Doris]]'' (1888), which, without rivalling ''Dorothy'', had a good run of more than 200 performances.

Stephenson's later work in musical theatre was less successful. For the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] he rewrote the libretto for ''The Golden Web'', an [[opera bouffe]] by the composer [[Arthur Goring Thomas]], which was first heard in 1893.  In spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the piece was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;"The Golden Web", ''[[The Musical Times]]'' March 1893, p. 152; and "Facts, Rumours, and Remarks", ''The Musical Times'', January 1893, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, two short operettas with music by [[Edward Jakobowski]], ''The Improvisatore'' and ''A Venetian Singer'', made little impact.&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', September 1893, p. 549 and "Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 11 November 1893, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ranch'', a musical farce with music by [[Edward Solomon]], failed to find a theatre to stage it. A libretto for [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], ''Christopher Patch, The Barber of Bath'', was set by Stanford but has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Frederick. "C. V. Stanford: Nova Bibliographica", ''The Musical Times'', October 1963, pp. 728–31&lt;/ref&gt; A libretto for [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] remained, as McKenzie put it in 1898, "still in my desk".&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Campbell Mackenzie", ''The Musical Times'', June 1898, pp. 369–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In the non-musical theatre, Stephenson continued to prosper. By the 1890s he was sufficiently well known that his name as author of a play lent cachet.  In 1892 one British newspaper protested that a new play, advertised as the work of Stephenson and [[Augustus Harris]], was in fact the work of less-known writers.&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 5 March 1892, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Stephenson produced one of his more enduring works, ''Faithful James'', a one act comedy. It supplanted Gilbert's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'' in a triple bill running at the Court Theatre. The cast included [[Weedon Grossmith]], Brandon Thomas, [[Ellaline Terriss]] and [[Sybil Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 23 July 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among later revivals of the play was one in 1907 with [[Rutland Barrington]] in the title role of the bumbling butler.&lt;ref&gt;"Coronet Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 July 1907, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Stephenson co-wrote a melodrama with [[Charles Haddon Chambers|Haddon Chambers]], ''The Fatal Card'', which was well received.&lt;ref&gt;"Adelphi Theatre: ''The Fatal Card''", ''The Sporting Times'', 8 September 1894, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how he and his collaborator worked together, he said, "We divide the labour. I write all the vowels and Mr Chambers all the consonants."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting Times'', 15 September 1894, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Among revivals of Stephenson's works, during his life and after, were ''Dorothy'' (on several occasions, notably in 1908, when the critic of ''The Times'' called it "one of the most tuneful, most charming, and most shapely of English comic operas") and ''Diplomacy'', which was given in command performances for [[Queen Victoria]] in 1893 and [[George V]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres: The Command Performance of ''Diplomacy'', " ''The Times'', 24 January 1914 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived again in 1924, starring [[Gladys Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres: Miss Gladys Cooper's New Part: Revival of ''Diplomacy''", ''The Times'', 11 February 1924, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson died in [[Taplow]], [[Berkshire]], at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''The British Catholic Stage Guild''', the main organisation for [[Roman Catholics]] in British entertainment, was founded in 1911. The aim of the Guild, as laid out in the 1931 Year Book, was ''"to establish and encourage spiritual, artistic and social intercourse among [Roman] Catholics connected with the theatrical and allied professions"''. The Guild is now known as the [http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=14489 '''Catholic Association of Performing Arts'''] (CaAPA). 

Its current details include: 
*Address: Corpus Christi Church, #1 Maiden Lane, London, UK, WC2E 7NB 
*Telephone: 020 7240 1221 
*Registered charity number: 267957
*Chair: Frank Comerford 
*CaAPA National Chaplain: Fr Chris Vipers
*CaAPA Chairman of Trustees: Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann 

Current membership includes such noted performers as [[Valerie Masterson]] and [[Simon Callow]], as well as numerous less well-known performers, such as actor Martin O'Brien, who co-founded ACTS (Association of Catholics in Theatre and on Screen) in 2005, and is the current Artistic Director of the CaAPA-affiliated Ten Ten Theatre. 

Deceased former members of the Guild include actors [[Sir Alec Guinness]] (a former Vice-President of the Guild), [[Patricia Hayes]] (who was a former Chair of the Guild, as was her son, actor [[Richard O'Callaghan]]), [[Danny La Rue]], [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] (a former Chair), [[Margaretta Scott]], [[Moira Lister]], [[Eamonn Andrews]] (a former Chair), [[Lionel Jeffries]] (a former Chair) and [[Frank Finlay]]. Guinness and Jeffries were both converts. Member [[Vince Powell]] was a noted television writer and producer. ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' star [[Joe Gladwin]] was Northern representative before his death.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Directory of England and Wales, 1981, pg 393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Activities of the Guild since then have been numerous and varied, including links with other denominations in services and carols, play readings, Students' Evenings, [[AIDS]] awareness Masses, music halls, recitals, and concerts. 

Past events have included a Memorial Mass for former Vice-President of the Guild, [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]], which was attended by his widow, Dame [[Judi Dench]], and their daughter, actress [[Finty Williams]]; a reception at the Garrick Club for Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]], which was hosted by [[Frank Finlay]]. Members of the Catholic Stage Guild and the [[English National Opera]] provided the entertainment; a fund-raising Quiz Night at Holy Apostles Church, [[Pimlico]] and a talk at the CAA, 20 Bedford Street, by [[Piers Paul Read]], the official biographer of the Guild's late Vice-President, Sir [[Alec Guinness]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Stage Guild website"&gt;[http://caapa.org.uk/diary/index.html/ Catholic Stage Guild website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christmastide Divination''''' ({{lang-ru|"Святочное гадание"}}) is a painting by Russian artist [[Konstantin Makovsky]] from around 1905. The painting shows a moonlit Russian folk divination during [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christmastide]] (''svyatki'') in a rural [[log house]] (''[[izba]]''). Five out of seven depicted women gathered around a [[rooster]] pecking the grain, the [[alectryomancy]] which foretells a marriage in the near future.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://vm1.culture.ru/muzey_istorii_religii/catalog/small/0002500424/|title=Картина "Святочное гадание"|publisher=Vm1.culture.ru| language=Russian| accessdate =13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls count the grains pecked by the rooster, watching if he did not peck more than twelve.&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hudojnik-peredvijnik.ru/makovskij-k-e/makovskij-k-e-svyatochnye-gadaniya/|title=Маковский К.Е.

The '''Coat of Arms of [[the Bahamas]]''' contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point.

==Description and explanation==
The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield) is supported by a [[marlin]] and [[flamingo]]. The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] on top of the helm (helmet) is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain.  Below the helm is the escutcheon itself, whose main [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] is a ship, reputed to represent the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' of [[Christopher Columbus]].  It is sailing beneath a sun in the [[chief (heraldry)|chief]].  The animals supporting the shield are the national animals, and the national [[motto]] is found at the bottom.  The flamingo is located upon land, and the marlin upon sea, indicating the geography of the islands.  

The vibrant [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s of the coat of arms are also intended to point to a bright future for the islands.  They are also reputed to have been maintained for their attractiveness to tourists.

The Coat of Arms was approved by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 December 1971. It was designed by Bahamian artist and clergyman, Dr. Hervis L. Bain, Jr., who is also a member of the [[Order of the British Empire]].

==Island arms==
In addition to the National Coat of Arms, there are a total of eighteen regional island shields (including two unofficial devices). These were granted upon Independence in 1973, to be displayed at the Independence day celebration to reflect each island's individual cultural heritage.

'''Codex of Munich''' (or Munich Codex) is a part of the oldest known Hungarian translation of the Bible, called Bible of Hussittes (or the Hussite Bible). It was written at Tatros (today [[Târgu Trotuș]], Romania) in 1466. Today it is located in [[Munich]] at [[Bavarian State Library]]. (Cod. Hung. 1)

==Content==

At the [[recto and verso|recto]] of the 108th letter, at the end of [[Gospel of John]], there is written who made the copy, where and when it was produced. As it is written, script was finished by György Németi, Son of Imre Henzsel. There is no  further mention about him.

The '''Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar''', founded in the late 1970s, provides training for dealers in out-of-print, used, and antiquarian books.

==Origins==
The Seminar was the brainchild of Margaret Knox Goggin, on the faculty (and formerly dean) of the School of Librarianship at the [[University of Denver]]. The first session, held at the University in December 1977, was primarily intended for librarians who wished to improve their skills in buying used, out-of-print, and rare books.&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980, p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five registrants heard lectures by Goggin, Jacob L. Chernofsky (Editor and Publisher of [[AB Bookman's Weekly]]), Lee Ash, and Harry U. Mooney (Collection Development Coordinator, [[Denver Public Library]]). The success of the venture encouraged Goggin and Chernofsky to offer an annual seminar beginning in 1979 on the out-of-print and antiquarian book market, "designed to help librarians throughout the country with a working knowledge of the out-of-print and antiquarian book trade and the role of that market in acquisitions procedures and collection development." &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 18, 1980, p. 4664.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50 students attended the 1979 Seminar, which was oriented toward the needs of librarians; nevertheless, "a half dozen booksellers also registered — pointing up the need for such a course for booksellers as well as librarians.” &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980 p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty members at the 1979 Seminar included the autograph dealer Mary A. Benjamin, Franklin Gilliam (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco), Edwin V. Glaser (a dealer specializing in rare medical books, based in Sausalito, CA), Katharine Kyes Leab (Editor of ''American Book Prices Current''), Murray S. Martin (Penn State), Bernard M. Rosenthal (a San Francisco-based dealer specializing in early printed books), and Florian Shasky (Stanford University Libraries).

==Early years==
The Seminar became an annual event held in August at the University of Denver under the co-directorship of Goggin and Chernofsky, its title settling down as "A Workshop-Seminar on the Out-of-Print and Antiquarian Book Market for Booksellers and Librarians," designed "to meet the needs of acquisitions librarians, those responsible for developing collections, rare book librarians, as well as booksellers and prospective booksellers.".&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' 23 June 1980, pp. 4886-89; July 7, 1980, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Seminar lecturers varied somewhat from year to year, but a core faculty emerged that included, besides Jake Chernofsky and Margaret Goggin, Michael Ginsberg (an Americana dealer based in Sharon, MA), Ed Glaser, Robert W. Topp (Hermitage Book Shop, Denver), and [[Jake Zeitlin]] (Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge, Los Angeles). Other stalwart faculty members were to include Mary Francis Ciletti, Lois Harvey, Jennifer Larson, Jean Parmer, and Richard Weatherford. Though there were always a few librarians in attendance, by the mid-1980s, the typical Seminar student was a used, out-of-print, or rare bookseller (or someone who wished to become one).

==Success==
The Seminar was soon attracting over 100 registrants annually. It ran extra sessions at the University of Florida in March 1988 and March 1994, in addition to the annual sessions in Colorado each August. Its success was chronicled in a series of annual articles by ''AB Bookman's Weekly'''s Associate Editor, Rebecca Myers, often titled with some variant of "Book is a four-letter word."&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquarian Book Seminar Entering Its 2nd Decade," May 29, 1989, pp. 2397-2402; "Antiquarian Book Seminar Launches Second Decade," May 28, 1990; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," June 24, 1991, pp. 2619-24 and May 11, 1992, 1929-32; "Sharing the Fingerspitzengefuehl," May 17, 1993, pp. 2091-94; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," May 16, 1994, pp. 2155-58 and Jan 9, 1995, pp. 9=-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1985, a keynote speaker began the proceedings on Sunday night. Notable keynoters included John Y. Cole (1985; [[Center for the Book]], [[Library of Congress]]); Marcus A. McCorison (1987; Director and Librarian, [[American Antiquarian Society]]); Robert Rosenthal (1989; head of special collections, [[University of Chicago]]); and Louis Weinstein (1999; Heritage Book Shop, Los Angeles). By the late 1980s, the Seminar had established a tradition of asking a different specialist dealer to join the faculty each year: Diane deBlois in 1988 (aGatherin', Wynanskill, NY; printed ephemera); Patterson Smith in 1990 (Montclair, NJ; true crime); John Crichton in 1991 (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco: literature); Priscilla Juvelis in 1996 (Boston; artists' books); and so on.

==Transition Years==
Margaret Knox Goggin stepped down as co-director of the Seminar after the 1994 Gainesville and Colorado Seminars, and the Denver connection weakened. The 1993 Seminar was hosted by the Colorado School of Mines in Golden; in 1995 the Seminar moved to [[Colorado College]], in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] (where it has been, ever since). Chernofsky continued as director, with Jennifer Larson as unnamed co-director; but in the later 1990s his magazine, [[AB Bookman's Weekly]], was faltering, unable to cope with the rise of internet bookselling; ''AB'' ceased publication in 1999, and Chernofsky sold the Seminar to faculty members Michael Ginsberg, Edwin Glaser, Lois Harvey, and Jennifer Larson (later, Daniel De Simone and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. jointly purchased a 1/5 share of the Seminar from the other shareholders). The Seminar was slow to refocus its presentations on what students most wanted to learn: more about researching and pricing used general-interest books; more about selling on eBay and the internet; less about older and more valuable antiquarian books. Attendance declined; by 2004, the average number of participants had fallen to well under 50.

==CABS Becomes a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Corporation==
The Seminar reinvigorated itself in the mid-2000s, with faculty additions [[Terry Belanger]], Thomas E. Congalton (Between the Covers Rare Books, Gloucester City, NJ), Daniel De Simone (Rosenwald Curator, Library of Congress), internet specialist Dan Gregory (Between the Covers), [[Kevin Royal Johnson]] (Royal Books, Baltimore), and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. (Rulon-Miller Books, St Paul, MN) joining Seminar stalwarts Ginsberg and Glaser. Participant response was enthusiastic,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, comments by Kenny Parolini, https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124325/http://ioba.org/newsletter/archive/7%282%29/toolbox2.php, accessed 2011-11-01; by Maria Hutchison, http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/08/update-from-the-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar, accessed 2011-11-01; and by Joel Perlman (in the newsletter of the Independent Online Booksellers Association, http://ioba.org/standard/2011/06/2009-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar-cabs-journal-or-teaching-an-old-dog-some-new-tricks/, accessed 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and attendance began to climb. The Seminar's title was given its present form: Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar (CABS) and a new [http://www.bookseminars.com website], and the proprietors relinquished their shares to a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation called the Antiquarian Book School Foundation. The current director of CABS is Rob Rulon-Miller and the current local coordinator at [[Colorado College]] is Kathy Lindeman; the chairman of the Foundation's board is Rob Rulon-Miller. The ongoing faculty comprises bookseller Lorne W. Bair (Winchester, VA); Terry Belanger (Charlottesville, VA); Brian Cassidy (Silver Spring, MD), Maria Lin (Saint Paul, MN); Katherine Reagan (Curator ofRare Books and Manuscripts, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), Rob Rulon-Miller (Saint Paul, MN) and Garrett Scott (Ann Arbor, MI).

Since 1980, nearly 3,000 persons have attended the Seminar, which throughout its existence has had the strong support of the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA): CABS board and faculty members over the years have included ABAA Presidents Thomas E. Congalton, Edwin V. Glaser, Michael Ginsberg, Bernard M. Rosenthal, Robert Rulon-Miller Jr, John Thomson, and others. In recent years, scholarships to CABS have been provided not only by ABAA (Woodburn Scholarships) but also by [[AbeBooks]], [[Biblio.com]], Bibliopolis, IOBA [[Independent Online Booksellers Association]], and the Rocky Mountain Antiquarian Booksellers Association (RMABA) as well as by the faculty themselves. Most of the current attendees are booksellers (or prospective booksellers), but librarians and book collectors sometimes attend, as well.

Now in its 40th year, the Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar is the oldest, continuously operated educational institution in the world for the antiquarian book trade, predating Rare Book School in Virginia, which was partially modeled on the Colorado Seminar, by nearly five years. Of the nearly 3,000 or so graduates of the Seminar, a remarkably high percentage of them are still involved in books, either as booksellers, librarians, and/or collectors.

'''Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu''' ({{IPA-ca|kunsəɾβəˈtɔɾi supəɾiˈo ðə ˈmuzikə ðəl liˈsɛw}}) is a [[music college]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It was created in 1837 with the name ''Liceo Filo-dramático de Montesión''.

In 1847 the institution inaugurated the opera house [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]]. In 1854, the Liceo Filarmónico and the Gran Teatre del Liceu separated administratively. Nevertheless, both entities have always remained closely linked.
[[File:TeatreDelLiceu.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]]]]
Among its students have been, among other, artists as: singers [[Francisco Viñas]], [[Maria Barrientos]], [[Josefina Huguet]], [[Conchita Supervía]], [[Mercedes Capsir]], [[Elvira de Hidalgo]], [[Miguel Fleta]], [[Victoria de los Ángeles]], [[Jaume Aragall]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Manuel Ausensi]], [[Josep Carreras|José Carreras]], [[Eduard Giménez]], [[Dalmacio González]], [[Juan Pons]], [[Nuria Rial]], [[Josep Bros]]; guitarist [[Renata Tarragó]]; pianist [[Frank Marshall (pianist)|Frank Marshall]] or composers [[Leonardo Balada]], [[Lluís Benejam]], [[Agusti Grau]] [[Joan Guinjoan]], [[Joan Lamote de Grignon]], [[Ricard Lamote de Grignon]], [[Frederic Mompou]], [[Carles Santos]], [[Manuel Valls (composer)|Manuel Valls]], and [[Joaquim Zamacois]]. Many of them also became professors there upon completion of their studies, including [[Renata Tarragó]]. Among the professors there were Catalan composers [[Enric Morera i Viura|Enric Morera]], [[Graciano Tarragó]] and German composer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]. The [[Barcelona Guitar Orchestra]] is based there.

Since 1999 Maria Serrat i Martín assume the General Direction and in 2002 the Spanish composer and musicologist [[Benet Casablancas]] assumed the academic direction of the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu.

Like many Matejko works, the picture presents a grand scene populated with numerous historic figures, including Poland's last King, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]]; [[Marshal of the Sejm|Marshals]] of the [[Great Sejm]] [[Stanisław Małachowski]] and [[Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha]]; co-authors of the Constitution such as [[Hugo Kołłątaj]] and [[Ignacy Potocki]]; and other major contemporary figures  such as [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]]. Some twenty individuals have been identified by modern historians; another ten or so who had been reported in older sources as being present, await definitive identification.

The picture was painted between January and October 1891 to commemorate the Constitution's centenary. It was one of the last works by Matejko, who died in November 1893. The painting was displayed in [[Lviv|Lwów]] (now Lviv, [[Ukraine]]) until 1920, when it was moved to [[Kraków]]. It was hidden during [[World War II]] and later moved to [[Warsaw]], where it now hangs in the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]].

==Constitution of May 3, 1791==
[[File:Konstytucja 3 Maja.jpg|thumb|475px|Larger resolution]]
{{main article|Constitution of May 3, 1791}}

The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]] was adopted as a "Government Act" (Polish: ''Ustawa rządowa'') on that date by the ''[[Sejm]]'' (parliament) of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It has been called  "the first constitution of its type in Europe" and the world's second oldest constitution.&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt;

It was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth's system of "[[Golden Liberty]]", which conferred disproportionate rights on the [[nobility]], had increasingly corrupted the Commonwealth's politics.&lt;ref name="bardach297-298"/&gt; The Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[magnate]]s with a more democratic [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref name="bardach304-308"/&gt; It introduced political equality between [[townspeople]] and nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') and placed the [[peasant]]s under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]].&lt;ref name="bardach304-308"/&gt; The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which at one time had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be [[bribery|bribed]] by an interest or foreign power, to undo the legislation adopted by that Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach304-308"/&gt;

The adoption of the May 3 Constitution met with hostile political and military responses from the Commonwealth's neighbors. In the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792]] (sometimes called the "War in Defense of the Constitution"), the Commonwealth was attacked by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]]'s [[Imperial Russia]] allied with the [[Targowica Confederation]], a coalition of Polish magnates and landless nobility who opposed reforms that might weaken their influence. The Commonwealth's ally [[Prussia]], under [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]], broke its alliance, and the Commonwealth was defeated.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-184-185"/&gt; In the end, the Constitution of May 3 remained in force for little more than one year.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-188-189"/&gt; Despite the Commonwealth's defeat in the Polish–Russian War and the ensuing [[partitions of Poland|partitions]] which eliminated the Commonwealth, the May 3 Constitution remained for more than 123 years a beacon in the struggle to restore Polish sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-188-189"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; In the words of two of its co-authors, [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]], it was "the last will and testament of the expiring Country."&lt;ref name="Machnikowski2010"/&gt;

==History==
The sketch of the work was presented in the cycle ''[[History of Civilization in Poland]]''.

Matejko began work on the painting in the middle of January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="K3M22"/&gt; Although the painting was not finished until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in [[Sukiennice]], [[Kraków]].&lt;ref name="K3M22"/&gt; On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred the painting to Prince [[Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko]], [[marshal of the Sejm|marshal]] of [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] in [[Lviv|Lwów]], and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the [[Lviv University]]).&lt;ref name="K3M21"/&gt; This painting was one of the last works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;

In 1920, two years [[Polish Independence Day|after Poland regained independence]], the painting was moved to [[Kraków]], where from 1923 it was displayed in the building of the [[Polish Sejm]].&lt;ref name="K3M21"/&gt; The painting was hidden by the [[Polish resistance in World War II|Polish resistance]] during [[World War II]], when Poland was [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied by the Germans]].&lt;ref name="K3M21"/&gt; After the war the painting was transferred to the [[National Museum in Warsaw]], and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building.&lt;ref name="K3M21"/&gt; Since 1984 the painting has been in the collection of the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]], where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown.&lt;ref name="K3M22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; The painting is displayed in the [[Antechamber|anteroom]] of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted.&lt;ref name="K3M22"/&gt; The painting was restored in 2007.&lt;ref name="K3M49"/&gt;

==Significance and historiography==
The painting is one of Matejko's best known works&lt;ref name="Jan Matejko"/&gt; and today it is commonly seen as one of his masterpieces, an "education in national history."&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reddaway1971"/&gt; However, it was less well received by his contemporaries, with turn-of-the-century reviews criticizing it for being "too crowded" and with unclear composition; supporters of Matejko's previous works were much more guarded in their praise of this painting.&lt;ref name="K3M25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3M40-41"/&gt;

Matejko's technique in this painting was subtly but noticeably different compared to his other paintings; authors Wrede ''et al''. attribute this to Matejko's exploration of new techniques, but note that contemporary critiques saw this departure from his old style as the weakening form of the dying master, and did not applaud the changes.&lt;ref name="K3M22"/&gt; They also note that Matejko usually dedicated two years to paintings of that size; this one was completed in less than a year, during a period in which Matejko was working on other projects and suffering from stress and depression.&lt;ref name="K3M40-41"/&gt; Matejko himself was not fond of the 18th century and the [[Polish Enlightenment]], remarking that he "would rather prefer to paint any other century".&lt;ref name="K3M23"/&gt; He felt compelled, however, by the anniversary of the Constitution to create an artwork commemorating the event, which he recognized as historically significant.&lt;ref name="K3M23"/&gt;

Matejko commonly identified the characters in his paintings with a written legend, but he did not create one for the ''Constitution''.&lt;ref name="K3M25"/&gt; Consequently, some characters in the painting have not been identified.&lt;ref name="K3M25"/&gt; A partial legend was written by Matejko's secretary, [[Marian Gorzkowski]], and even though it provides a list of 39 characters, Wrede ''et al''. write that his "chaotic description" is not very helpful.&lt;ref name="K3M25"/&gt; Modern analysis has been done by Polish historians [[Jarosław Krawczyk]] and [[Emanuel M. Rostworowski]].&lt;ref name="K3M25"/&gt;

==Content==
[[Image:Konstytucja 3 Maja guide.jpg|thumb|600px|Identified individuals (see text for legend)]]
The painting, set in the late afternoon of May 3, 1791, shows the procession of deputies from the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] (''background''), where the Constitution has just been adopted by the [[Great Sejm]], to [[St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw|St. John's Collegiate Church]] (''left'', now an archcathedral), where a ''[[Te Deum]]'' will be sung.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; The procession moves down St. John's Street (''ulica Świętojańska''), surrounded by enthusiastic Warsaw residents and visitors.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; The deputies are protected by soldiers.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;

While the procession was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons who were not in fact present or had died earlier.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of the final years of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=kos/&gt; He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.&lt;ref name="K3M24"/&gt;

===Center===
The painting is centered on the [[Sejm marshal]] [[Stanisław Małachowski]] (1), who is wearing a white, French-inspired costume.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Małachowski holds the marshal staff in his left hand and in his right hand, he triumphantly raises the text of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Although the historical document was titled ''Ustawa rządowa'' (Government Ordinance), Matejko chose to make the title page of the document as portrayed in his painting more explicit—and at the same time put the name of the painting right in its center.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; He is carried by deputies [[Aleksander Linowski]] of [[Kraków]] (2) (on his right) and [[Ignacy Zakrzewski]] of [[Poznań]] (3) (on his left).&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; Their significance is that Kraków and Poznań are principal cities of two major regions of Poland: [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Greater Poland]], respectively. Under Małachowski's right hand there is a figure  with a bandaged head holding a flag; this is [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] (4), and his head wound is a reference to the [[battle of Maciejowice]], which took place during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] in 1794, three years after the event depicted in the painting.&lt;ref name=kos/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; To the left of Kościuszko, is a figure identified by Wrona ''et al''. as Prince [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]], although this is disputed by other sources.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;

Another figure, to the right of Małachowski, is being carried; he is [[Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha]] (5), marshal of the Lithuanian confederation and the second Sejm marshal.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Between Małachowski and Sapieha, the head of [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]] (6), a well-known writer, is visible. He appears to be carrying Sapieha.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; The other figure carrying Sapieha, to his right, is [[Michał Zabiełło]] (7).&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;

In the lower center of the painting, Matejko shows a scene that took place in the Royal Castle.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; [[Jan Suchorzewski]] (8), deputy from [[Kalisz]] and an opponent of the Constitution, has fallen to the ground, holding his young son with one arm; his other hand, holding a knife, is held by [[Stanisław Kublicki]] (9), standing to his right.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;&lt;ref name=biul/&gt; Kublicki was a deputy from [[Inflanty Voivodeship|Inflanty]], a supporter of the townsfolk and peasant causes, and of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;&lt;ref name=biul/&gt; The artist here alludes to Suchorzewski's unsuccessful attempt to prevent the king from signing the Constitution, during which he threatening to kill his own son to save him from the "slavery of the Constitution". A deck of cards has fallen out of Suchorzewski's pocket, a reference to the manner in which he was bribed by the anti-Constitution Russian ambassador [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (ambassador)|Otto Magnus von Stackelberg]] and [[hetman]] [[Franciszek Branicki|Branicki]]; Suchorzewski suddenly started winning large sums of money in games, despite his poor skills as a gambler.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Branicki (10) can be seen standing between the king and Suchorzewski, dressed in a Russian uniform, foreshadowing the rank of [[general]] he received several years later in the [[Russian Army]]. In reality Suchorzewski, like most of those opposed to the Constitution, refused to participate in the procession.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;

Notable figures in the center of the painting, to the left of Małachowski, include other supporters of the Constitution. Priest [[Hugo Kołłątaj]] (11) is the most prominent, gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name=biul/&gt; Several other figures in the vicinity are described in sources, but their precise location is unclear, or the sources contradict one another. The priest holding the Bible (12) is probably [[Feliks Turski]], although some identify him as [[Tymoteusz Gorzeński]].&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name=biul/&gt; The figures to the right of Kołłątaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal, [[Ignacy Potocki]] (13), and perhaps [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]] (14) (although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting, in the vicinity of Kościuszko).&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Surrounding Kołłątaj are likely the priest [[Scipione Piattoli]] (15) and [[Tadeusz Matuszewicz]] or Matusiewicz (16).&lt;ref name=biul/&gt;

===Left===
On the stairs of the church, King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (17) is ascending.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; Matejko was not very fond of Poniatowski, and he portrayed him in a rather pompous posture, with his hand extended to be kissed, and in the company of numerous pretty ladies, supporting his reputation as a "lady's man".&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Poniatowski's inclusion in the procession is one of Matejko's artistic liberties, as he had arrived at the church before the procession.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; A woman hands him a [[laurel wreath]] (18); sources have identified her as the [[Courland]] princess [[Dorothea von Medem]] (Dorothea Biron) or Róża z Martynkowskich, wife of former Warsaw mayor [[Jan Dekert]].&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; Behind her (leftmost in the group of two women, with only her face showing) stands [[Elżbieta Grabowska]] (19), the king's mistress and mother of his children.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; Bowing at the church doors is the former mayor of Warsaw, Jan Dekert (20).&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; He is accompanied by his daughter Marianna (in a yellow dress, facing away from the viewer) taking a prominent position near the king (38).&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;&lt;ref name=obrazy/&gt; Dekert's inclusion in the painting is another example of Matejko taking liberties with history, as he died in October 1790; he was an important [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burgher]]s figure associated with the [[Free Royal Cities Act]], which was incorporated into the Constitution.&lt;ref name="jj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jj2"/&gt;

Behind the king, holding his hands to his head, is Prince [[Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk]] (21), another opponent of the Constitution, known for being on a Russian payroll.&lt;ref name=biul/&gt; Below him is another opponent of the Constitution, [[Antoni Złotnicki]] (22).&lt;ref name=biul/&gt; An anonymous  black-clad French royalist (23) is shown looking terrified at the scene, seeing another revolution in the making. He raises his hand over the king's head.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;

In the group of people gathered below the king, in another acknowledgement of the burghers' importance, is burgher [[Jan Kiliński]] (24), one of the leaders of the Kościuszko Uprising.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; To his right, at the edge of the crowd, is the priest [[Clemens Maria Hofbauer]] (25), who ran an orphanage and a school in Warsaw and is [[canonized]] as a saint in the [[Catholic]] church.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;

===Right===
To the right of Sapieha are reformer [[Stanisław Staszic]] (26) and, with his hand around Staszic, [[Andrzej Zamoyski]] (27), author of the [[Zamoyski Codex]], an earlier attempt to reform the state.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; To the left of Staszic, the head of [[bishop of Smoleńsk]], [[Tymoteusz Gorzeński]] (28), is visible in the crowd.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski, with an outstretched hand, is [[Kazimierz Konopka]] (29), Kołłątaj's secretary and one of the [[Polish Jacobins]]; Konopka has a French [[Flag of France|blue-white-red]] flower in his hat and a [[czekan]], an ax- and hammer-like weapon, in his hand.&lt;ref name=obrazy/&gt; Above them is an unnamed [[Eastern Orthodox]] priest (30); the figure on his right (31) is either [[Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski]], pioneer of agricultural reforms, or [[Józef Stępkowski]], a less progressive figure.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; This line of figures ends with [[Antoni Tyzenhauz]] (32), Lithuanian official and reformer.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt; To the right of Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant (33). His passive attitude is seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;

To their right is the king's nephew, prince [[Józef Poniatowski]] (34), in the uniform of the light cavalry of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and riding a grey horse.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; The uniform is another instance of foreshadowing; Poniatowski became the commander-in-chief of the Duchy's army and died during the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. At the time of the passing of the Constitution, he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison, and is shown keeping an eye on the procession, with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; To his right, partially obscured by Poniatowski's horse's head, is [[Stanisław Mokronowski]] (35), deputy, general, and future leader of the Kościuszko Uprising in Lithuania.&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;

At the very bottom right corner, two [[Polish Jew]]s are on the edge of the scene; the younger (36) one is usually described as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a ''Sy, git'' ("that's good") gesture.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naukowo-Badawczy2007"/&gt; Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="K3Mid"/&gt;—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms.&lt;ref name="biul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naukowo-Badawczy2007"/&gt; The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.&lt;ref name="Naukowo-Badawczy2007"/&gt;

==Notes==
'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} The painting does not have one dominant title, either in Polish or English. It is referred to variously, with different renderings of the name of the Constitution of May 3 (such as "The Constitution of the 3rd May",&lt;ref name="SokolKissane1992"/&gt; "The Third of May Constitution"&lt;ref name="SalterBousfield2002"/&gt; or "Constitution of 3 May 1791",&lt;ref name="Ward1989"/&gt;) or in an even more elaborate fashion. For example, Reddaway calls it "King Stanislaw Augustus entering Warsaw Cathedral after the passing of the reformed Constitution of 1791".&lt;ref name="Reddaway1971"/&gt;

The '''Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia''' ('''CACSA''') was an [[art museum]] and [[art space]] located in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]]. In late 2016 it merged with the [[Australian Experimental Art Foundation]] to form [[ACE Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/adelaide/art-and-design/ace-our-sleeves|title=An ACE Up Our Sleeves|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CACSA was one of Australia's most prominent contemporary art organisations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art and AsiaPacific: Issues 33-36|publisher=Fine Art Press|year=2002|issn=1039-3625|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its mission was "promote, develop and support contemporary art practice and critical thinking through South Australian, national and international exhibitions, publications, debate and associated activities."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacsa.org.au/?page_id=629|title=About|publisher=The Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CACSA was established in 1942 as the '''Contemporary Art Society''' as a breakaway from the [[Royal Society of Arts]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;  The CACSA was one of the 12 members of the national Contemporary Art Organisations of Australia (CAOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caos.org.au/content/Members/|title=Members|publisher=Contemporary Art Organisations of Australia (CAOS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CACSA also publishes the quarterly [[Art Journal (CAA)|art journal]] 
''Contemporary Visual Arts and Culture Broadsheet''.&lt;ref name="broadsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacsa.org.au/?page_id=1369|title=BROADSHEET|publisher=The Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; CACSA had  undertaken regular large scale survey and multi-sited surveys of contemporary South Australian art as part of the CACSA Contemporary series including CACSA Contemporary 2010: THE NEW NEW, CACSA CONTEMPORARY 2012: NEW SA ART + IBIDEM: PUBLIC ART PROJECT and CACSA Contemporary 2015. CASCA also provided a space to predominantly emerging and experimental arts practice as part of the Project Space exhibition program.

The '''Copyright Clause''' (also known as the '''Intellectual Property Clause''', '''Copyright and Patent Clause''', or the '''Progress Clause'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lessig |first= Lawrence |authorlink= Lawrence Lessig |title= Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity |url= http://www.jus.uio.no/sisu/free_culture.lawrence_lessig/portrait.letter.pdf |accessdate= 2018-07-19 |year= 2004|edition=PDF|publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |page=130-131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes an [[Enumerated powers|enumerated power]] listed in the [[United States Constitution]] ([[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 8]]).  The clause states that the [[United States Congress]] shall have power "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."

The clause is the basis of [[intellectual property]] laws in the United States, specifically [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright]] and [[Patent law of the United States|patent]] laws.

== History ==
On August 18, 1787, the Constitutional Convention was in the midst of a weeks-long stretch of proposals to establish what would become the enumerated powers of the [[United States Congress]]. Three such proposals made on that day addressed what are now lumped together under [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]]. One, by [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] was "to secure to authors exclusive rights for a limited time". The other two were made by [[James Madison]], who had previously served on a committee of the Congress established under the [[Articles of Confederation]] which had encouraged the individual states to adopt copyright legislation. Madison proposed that the Constitution permit Congress "to secure to literary authors their copyrights for a limited time", or, in the alternative, "to encourage, by proper premiums &amp; Provisions, the advancement of useful knowledge and discoveries".&lt;ref name="William F. Patry 1994"&gt;William F. Patry, ''Copyright Law and Practice'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both proposals were referred to the [[Committee of Detail]], which reported back on September 5, 1787 with a proposal containing the current language of the clause. No record exists to explain the exact choice of words selected by the Committee on Detail, whose task was essentially no more than creating a draft Constitution by arranging the proposals that had been made into the most appropriate language. On September 17, 1787, the members of the Convention unanimously agreed to the proposed language, without debate, and this language was incorporated into the Constitution.&lt;ref name="William F. Patry 1994"/&gt;

== Effect ==
The clause actually confers two distinct powers: the power to secure for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings is the basis for [[United States copyright law|U.S. copyright law]], and the power to secure for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries is the basis for [[United States patent law|U.S. patent law]]. Because the clause contains no language under which Congress may protect [[trademark]]s, those are instead protected under the [[Commerce Clause]]. Some terms in the clause are used in archaic meanings, potentially confusing modern readers. For example, "useful Arts" does not refer to artistic endeavors, but rather to the work of [[artisan]]s, people skilled in a manufacturing craft; "Sciences" refers not only to fields of modern scientific inquiry but rather to all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ochoa |first=Tyler T.  |editor-first=Peter K.  |editor-last=Yu |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2007 |pages=133 |chapter=Chapter 7: Copyright Duration: Theories and Practice |isbn=9780275988838 |oclc=71427267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copyright Clause is the only clause granting power to Congress for which the means to accomplish its stated purpose are specifically provided. The exact limitations of this clause have been defined through a number of [[United States Supreme Court]] cases interpreting the text. For example, the Court has determined that because the purpose of the clause is to stimulate development of the works it protects, its application cannot result in inhibiting such progress.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, there has been a countervailing strain in the courts that has promoted a varying view.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Furthermore, the clause only permits protection of the writings of authors and the discoveries of inventors. Hence, writings may only be protected to the extent that they are original,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 349 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and "inventions" must be truly inventive and not merely obvious improvements on existing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Graham v. John Deere Co.]]'', 383 U.S. 1 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; The term "writings of authors" appears to exclude non-human authorship such as painting by chimpanzees and computer code written by programmed computers,&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices § 313.2 (3d ed. 2017) ("The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.").&lt;/ref&gt; but the issue has not been tested in litigation.

Although perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited&amp;mdash;the language specifies "limited times"&amp;mdash;the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute a perpetual copyright. In that case, the United States Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the [[Copyright Term Extension Act|Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]], also known pejoratively as the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://econ161.berkeley.edu/movable_type/archives/000835.html  A Platonic Dialogue on ''Eldred v. Ashcroft''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Petitioners in that case argued that successive retroactive extensions of copyright were functionally unlimited and hence violated the ''limited times'' language of the clause.  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]], writing for the Court, rejected this argument, reasoning that the terms provided by the Act were limited in duration and noted that Congress had a long history of granting retroactive extensions.

[[File:Flag of Montreal (1939-2017).svg|thumb|Flag of Montreal from 1939 to 2017]]
The '''flag of [[Montreal]]''' was first displayed in May 1935 and is based on the [[Coat of arms of Montreal|city's coat of arms]]. It was revised in May 1939 and again in 13 September 2017. The flag's proportions are 1:2 in a [[Flag terminology|symmetric cross]].

==Symbolism==
The red [[heraldry|heraldic]] cross represents the "Christian motives and principles which governed the founders of the city," according to the city's official web site.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,42249635&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL What do the symbols on Montréal's coat of arms mean?]", Centre d'histoire de Montréal, Ville de Montréal, retrieved May 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The five emblems represent the ancestral presence of Indigenous peoples and the four main European ethnic groups that were settled in the city in the 19th century, and which are also represented on the [[Canadian Red Ensign]].  They are:

==Previous flag==
[[File:Armoiries Montreal 1833.jpg|right|thumb|Original 1833 [[Coat of arms of Montreal]]]]
Montreal's flag is based on its coat of arms. The original coat of arms was designed in 1833 by the first mayor of Montreal, Jacques Viger. It was similar to the current version with the difference that the red cross was a [[saltire]] and a beaver stood in the place of what is now a fleur-de-lys. The arms were revised in 1938.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}}

Four years prior to the first raising of the revised flag, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], the sovereign of Canada, celebrated his Silver Jubilee (25th year on the throne) on Monday May 6, 1935. An article in the Montreal Gazette from May 3, 1935&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h5MuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4083,362980&amp;dq=montreal%27s-flag&amp;hl=en Montreal to have city flag to fly]", Montreal Gazette May 3-1935, retrieved November 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the city’s Jubilee committee had discovered a rule whereby official coats of arms of British corporations could be interpreted into flag banners. Per the article, Montreal prepared to raise its own distinct flag for the first time ever on the King’s Jubilee day based on the original coat of arms by Jacques Viger.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}}

==Current flag==
On February 12, 2017, the Mayor of Montreal [[Denis Coderre]] announced a modification to the flag of Montreal to include a First Nations symbol.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/montreal/201702/14/01-5069456-les-autochtones-choisiront-le-nouveau-symbole-du-drapeau-de-montreal.php Les autochtones choisiront le nouveau symbole du drapeau de Montréal]"(In French), La Presse Feb 14-2017, retrieved February 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made in 2017 during the city's 375th anniversary of the founding of the city. The symbol was chosen by the First Nations communities of Montreal, those being [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] and [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] although there are large [[Inuit]], [[Métis]] and [[Anishinaabe]]g populations.

'''Frederick Polydore Nodder''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1770 – c. 1800) was an [[England|English]] [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]] [[illustrator]], a copperplate engraver and a miniature painter.

Nodder illustrated [[George Shaw]]'s periodical ''The Naturalist's Miscellany''. He also helped [[Joseph Banks]] prepare the ''[[Banks' Florilegium]]'' and converted most of [[Sydney Parkinson]]'s [[Australia]]n plant drawings from the [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']] expedition into paintings and helped engrave them for publication. There are Nodder drawings and paintings of Australian birds and butterflies in the Natural History Division of the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/nodder-frederick.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8552">[[File:Portrait bust of Horace Brodzky by Gaudier-Brzeska, 1913 (Tate Gallery).jpg|thumb|Portrait bust of Horace Brodzky by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, 1913 (Tate Gallery)]]'''Horace Ascher Brodzky''' (30 January 1885 – 11 February 1969) was an Australian-born artist and writer most of whose work was created in London and New York. His work included paintings, drawings and [[linocut]]s, of which he was an early pioneer. An associate in his early career of many leading artists working in Britain of his period, including [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], and members of the [[Vorticism]] movement, he ended his life relatively neglected.

==Early life==
Brodzky was born in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], [[Melbourne]] in 1885 to the Australian journalist Maurice Brodzky (a [[Jew]]ish immigrant to Australia from Poland), and his wife Flora, née Leon.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"&gt;Lambirth (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he assisted his father in the production of the magazine ''Table Talk''.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;Cannon (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodzky studied initially at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School|National Gallery School]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; In 1904 his father was bankrupted after exposing corruption, and Horace moved with his family to San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

==London==
In 1908, Brodzky went to London where he studied during 1911 at the [[City and Guilds of London Art School|City and Guilds South London Technical Art School]]. He became an acquaintance and follower of [[Walter Sickert]]. Amongst his friends was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who created in 1913 a [[portrait bust]] of Brodzky (now in the [[Tate Gallery]], London), and whose biography he wrote in 1933.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/search?q=Brodzky "Brodzky"], ''Tate Gallery'' website, accessed 29 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodzky is said to have been so engrossed in talk when he visited Gaudier-Brzeska's studio in the [[King's Road]], that he missed the last bus to [[Herne Hill]] where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=Virginia|title=Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900-1939|date=2003|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=0141933402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodzky travelled to Italy with the poet  [[John Gould Fletcher]]  and this led to his first London exhibition, "Paintings and Sketches of Italian and Sicilian Scenes" (c. 1911), of which one painting was selected for the 1912 [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;  He was in fact the first Australian to be exhibited at the Biennale.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt; In 1914 his work was exhibited along with that of other Jewish artists, including Mark Gertler and [[David Bomberg]], in the [[Whitechapel Gallery]]. Brodzky became a member of [[The London Group]].&lt;ref name="lag"&gt;[http://www.londonartsgroup.com/Artist-Info.cfm?ArtistsID=355&amp;Collection=&amp;info=CV "Horace Brodzky"], London Arts Group website accessed 2 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he was a pioneer of the technique of linocut, in which medium he has been said to have "excelled". His early oils reveal the influence of both Gertler and Bomberg.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"&gt;Weindling (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works of this period are portraits of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Jacob Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;

==New York==
In 1915 Brodzky moved to New York, with an introduction to the art patron [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; There he worked as a poster artist and an arts journalist,&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; and in 1917 helped Quinn organize a New York exhibition of Vorticist artists. In 1919 he married Bertha Greenfield; they were to have three sons.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt; In 1920 [[Egmont Arens]] published in New York a collection of 21 of Brodzky's linoprints. Brodzky also designed [[book jacket]]s for writers including [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]],&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; and painted a portrait of O'Neill.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;

==Back to England==
Returning to London in 1923 he became a professional artist. His work featured in the first-ever exhibition of linocuts, organized by [[Claude Flight]] at the [[Redfern Gallery]] in  1929.&lt;ref name="Anon2"&gt;Anon 2 (n.d)&lt;/ref&gt; Initial success however withered in the 1930s, when his marriage broke up, and from then on he lived in financial straits. In 1935 [[James Laver]] published a study  ''Forty Drawings by Horace Brodzky''. Laver described Brodzky's drawing technique as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Brodzky prefers the ordinary 'dip-in' steel nib, for this enables the hand, by varying its pressure on the paper, to broaden the line at will, or rather in obedience to the obscure subconscious or half-conscious promptings which guide the hand to its task. He makes no preliminary studies, draws no pencil outline, carefully rubbed out afterwards to give a false impression of spontaneity. There are no erasures or alterations. Each drawing is made 'au premier coup'. It is made very quickly, as a unity, and when finished the artist cannot remember at what point it was started. The drawing has been thrown on the paper, as it were, with a single gesture.&lt;ref name="lag"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1946 Brodzky published his own study of the French-Romanian-Jewish artist [[Pascin|Jules Pascin]]. In London he lived for most of the rest of his life in the [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] and [[Willesden]] areas, continuing to produce paintings, drawings and linocuts. He supported himself by teaching and painting stage-decor and from 1948 to 1962 he was art-editor of the ''Antique Dealer and Collector's Guide'', (founded by his brother Adrian).&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

==Final years==
In 1963, Brodzky wrote to the collector [[Ruth Borchard]], who had just purchased from him a self-portrait for the sum of 12 guineas (₤12.60):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since 1911 I have been connected with the London art world &amp; have exhibited at all important exhibitions…and have worked for modern art... For a long time I have sold none of my work &amp; have had to rely on selling items by other artists that I have collected…This letter is not an angry complaint but just the plain facts that I thought you might like to know.&lt;ref&gt;Anon 1 (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 80th anniversary exhibitions were organized for Brodzky at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] and the [[Oxford Union]] Cellars.&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt; In 1967 some of his early linocuts were reissued in London in a signed edition of 60 prints. Brodzky died in Kilburn in 1969, when his estate was valued for [[probate]] at £7977.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; Exhibitions of Brodzky's work were held in the [[Jewish Museum of Australia]] (1988) and at the Boundary Gallery, London (1989).&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt;

'''Irrealism''' is a philosophical position first advanced by [[Nelson Goodman]] in "Ways of Worldmaking",&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and [[aesthetics]].

==Nelson Goodman's irrealism==
Irrealism was initially motivated by the debate between [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]] in [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than viewing either as prior to the other, Goodman described them both as alternative "world-versions", both useful in some circumstances, but neither capable of capturing the other in an entirely satisfactory way, a point he emphasizes with examples from psychology.&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 : Ch. V)&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to extend this [[epistemology|epistemic]] pluralism to all areas of knowledge, from equivalent [[formal system]]s in [[mathematics]] (sometimes it is useful to think of points as primitives, sometimes it is more useful to consider lines the primitive) to alternative schools of [[art]] (for some paintings thinking in terms of representational accuracy is the most useful way of considering them, for others it is not). However, in line with his consideration of [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]], Goodman goes beyond saying merely that these are "world-versions" of ''the'' world, instead he describes worlds as "made by making such versions".&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.94)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysically, Goodman's irrealism is distinct from [[anti-realism]] though the two concepts are frequently confused. "We are not speaking in terms of multiple possible alternatives to a single actual world but of multiple actual worlds."&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.2)&lt;/ref&gt; He makes no assertions regarding "the way the world is" and that there is no primary world version i.e. "no true version compatible with all true versions." As Goodman says, "Not only motion, ... but even reality is relative."&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.20)&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that Goodman accepts many forms of realism and anti-realism without being troubled by the resulting contradictions.

==Other Irrealists==

The artist [[Tristan Tondino]] has had several exhibitions entitled "Irreality" which crossover into other fields and include philosophy, mathematics, [[ophthalmology]], science and politics. He writes, "Realism is an Irrealism. Reality is plurality - we partially create it, we must open our universes and our perceptions to all new versions that may promote the concept of human rights and expand its possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Émile Brisson, Plurielle Ouverture, AGIR, Amnestie Internationale, vol 25, #3, septembre 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a painting depicting a chair and entitled "The Hegemony of the Real", Tondino has written "That the Real must be regarded as a fiction does not detract from its hegemony".

The [[sociologist]] [[Nikolas Rose]] subscribes to irrealism in his ''Powers of Freedom'', though his irrealism differs from Nelson's in being 'technical, not psychologistic, furthering Nelson's assertions of the human mind are only capable of a limited understanding and that it is a construct built upon itself."

==Other Forms of Irrealism==

The philosophical term may be used in more specific or arguably narrower senses, such as "colour irrealism".&lt;ref&gt;https://frodo.ucsc.edu/~jellis/Papers/Color.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jedda'''''  (released in the UK as '''Jedda the Uncivilized''') is a 1955 Australian film written, produced and directed by [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]]. His last film, it is notable for being the first to star two [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] actors, [[Robert Tudawali]], better known Bobby Wilson and [[Rosalie Kunoth-Monks|Ngarla Kunoth]], now known as Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, in the leading roles. It was also the first Australian feature film to be shot in colour.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} ''Jedda'' is seen by some {{who|date=May 2016}} as an influential film in the development of Australian cinema, as setting a new standard for future Australian films. It won more international attention than previous Australian films, during a time when Hollywood films were dominating the Australian cinema. The director, Charles Chauvel, was nominated for the [[Golden Palm Award]] in the [[1955 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Jedda |accessdate=1 February 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118215228/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost to the American [[Delbert Mann]] for ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]''.

==Plot==
[[File:Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks).jpg|thumb|right|Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, who played the title role]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Robert Tudawali at Darwin's Bagot Reserve 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Tudawali, appeared as Marbuck in Jedda]] Jedda is an Aboriginal girl born on a [[cattle station]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia. After her mother dies giving birth to her, the child is brought to Sarah McMann, the wife of the station boss. Sarah has recently lost her own newborn to illness. She at first intends to give the baby to one of the Aboriginal women who work on the station, but then raises Jedda as her own, teaching her European ways and separating her from other Aborigines.

Jedda wants to learn about her own culture, but is forbidden by Sarah. When Jedda grows into a young woman, she becomes curious about an Aboriginal man from the bush named Marbuck. This tall stranger arouses strong feelings in her. She is lured to his camp one night by a song. Marbuck abducts her and sets off back to his tribal land, through [[crocodile]]-infested swamps.

Joe, a [[half-caste]] [[stockman (Australia)|stockman]] in love with Jedda, tracks the two for several days. They travel across high, rocky country, and down a river until Marbuck reaches his tribe. The tribal council declares that Marbuck has committed a serious crime by bringing Jedda to them, because she is not of the right [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin group]]. They sing his death song as punishment. Marbuck defies the elders and takes Jedda into an area of steep cliffs and canyons, [[taboo]] lands. Driven insane by the death song, he pulls Jedda with him over a tall cliff, and both perish. Joe, the narrator, says her spirit has joined "the great mother of the world, in the [[Dreamtime|dreaming time]] of tomorrow."

==Development==
Charles Chauvel says the original inspiration for the film came from a meeting he had in Hollywood in early 1950 with [[Merian C. Cooper]]. Cooper encouraged the director to make a film exploiting Australian locations. Chauvel was further encouraged along these lines by [[Bess Meredyth]] who had made a number of films in Australia in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18181721 |title=Our Outback Is A Rich Field fur Film Makerss. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=31 August 1950 |accessdate=18 August 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel decided to make the project in the Northern Territory. With his wife Elsa he made an extensive survey of the Territory later that year with the assistance of the Commonwealth government. He undertook colour tests, intending to make Australia's first colour movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18176127 |title="Herald" Saturday Magazine |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 September 1950 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23070297 |title=Stark color film to be 'shot' in N.T. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=19 June 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chauvels then wrote a screenplay, originally entitled ''The Northern Territory Story''.

The lead aboriginal character was reportedly inspired by the warrior [[Nemarluk]], who killed three Japanese pearlers in the 1930s and died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49220497 |title=N.T.

In 1951 Chauvel formed Chauvel Productions Ltd to make the film, with a notional capital of £500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2825759 |title=MOTION PICTURE FIRM IN SYDNEY. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=31 March 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18222953 |title=Chauvel To Make Film In N.T. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=19 June 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went public in August 1951, offering 240,000 shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18216554 |title=CAPITAL FOR FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 August 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel later claimed he turned down an American offer of $100,000 (£44,000) to finance the film because it was conditional upon [[Linda Darnell]] being cast in the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50537899 |title=Forever Amber—but never Jedda role. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=13 September 1952 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel's regular backers [[Universal Pictures]] did not want to invest in the movie but Chauvel managed to secure finance from various businessmen, including Mainguard Australia Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71700702 |title=MAINGUARD'S INTERESTS. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=11 October 1955 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took the Chauvels 18 months to find a suitable filming location.

==Production==
[[File:Filming of Australian film Jedda.jpg|thumb|Robert Tudawali with [[William Edward Harney|Bill Harney]]  and Charles Chauvel prior to the filming of Jedda.]]
Filming started in May 1952, when the unit left Sydney for Darwin. By this stage the lead role of Jedda had still yet to be cast, but filming acting sequences did not begin until July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2855452 |title=N. TERRITORY AS SCENE OF FIRST COLOUR FILM. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=19 May 1952 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Tudawali was a full-blooded aboriginal from [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18420227 |title=MALE LEAD GOES HOME. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 April 1954 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks) was an [[Anmatyerre]] woman, born at [[Utopia, Northern Territory|Utopia cattle station]], north east of [[Alice Springs]]; she was selected over seven other actors screen tested, and was cast by July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44799783 |title="Jedda" and her foster family. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=9 June 1971 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18382912 |title=Arunta Tribe Girl Star. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 July 1953 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoot took five months to complete, plus post-production work done in Sydney. Most of the scenes were shot on the [[Coolibah Station]] in the [[Northern Territory]], as well as at [[Standley Chasm]], Ormiston Gorge and Mary River in the north.

The Chauvels celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary during filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18267649 |title=Had Silver Wedding In Outback. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 June 1952 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wason Byers, who had a small role, was arrested for stealing over £1,000 worth of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18388184 |title=N.T.

The production process was laborious, as the colour technique used, [[Gevacolor]], could only be processed in England. The film stock was fragile and heat-sensitive, which was a problem in the tropical climate of the Northern Territory. During production, the film was stored in cool caves to protect it from deteriorating. By mid 1952 the film had incurred expenses of £24,673.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18294355 |title=Progress cost of film|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 December 1952 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last roll of negative was destroyed in a plane crash on its way for developing in England. Chauvel re-shot these lost scenes at [[Kanangra Walls]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] and [[Jenolan Caves]] west of [[Sydney]]. Cave scenes were Filmed in the River Cave, Diamond Cave, Imperial Cave, and Mud Tunnels at Jenolan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51078321 |title=He's Out to Prove the Dead Heart Beats|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=25 July 1953 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editing and sound recording were completed in London.

The music was written by [[Isador Goodman]].  Elsa Chauvel, the director's wife, replaced large parts of Goodman's score with old-fashioned commercial ‘mood’ music.

==Reception==
[[File:Rosalie Kunoth-Monks.jpg|thumb|Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, speaking at the Darwin premiere of Jedda at the Star Theatre in Darwin, Northern Territory in 1955.]]
The film has its world premiere on 3 January 1955 at the [[Star Theatre (Darwin)|Star Theatre]] in Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49485186 |title=N. T.

He decorated the theatre for the opening with pandanus, grass mats and Aboriginal artefacts. Large crowds gathered along Smith Street to catch a glimpse of the film's stars Ngarla Kunoth and Robert Tudawali were permitted to sit in the balcony with the Northern Territory Administrator [[Frank Wise]] and his wife.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brister|first1=Charles|title=A history of the Star Theatre of Darwin|journal=Journal of Northern Territory History|date=1995|volume=6|pages=35–43|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=951110232;res=IELAPA|accessdate=21 September 2016|issn=1034-7488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then opened in Sydney in May. Its commercial reception was solid rather than sensational: Charles Chauvel Productions Ltd received £17,915 from the film in May and June 1955. The company's name was changed to Jedda Ltd to help exploit the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71781846 |title=Jedda a big success. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=23 November 1955 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1956 Jedda Ltd reported a profit of £50,454 for the year to 30 June, reducing the debit balance in the production account to £69,697.  The film had been successful in Australia but performed disappointingly overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71770367 |title=Jedda's £50,454. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=8 December 1956 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=25 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released in the UK as ''Jedda the Uncivilised''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59701496 |title=JEDDA will get new title for U.K. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=13 February 1955 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=50 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the film was completed and released in locations around the world, the film in Gevacolor was found to have faded from aging.  In 1972 the film was reproduced from original tri-separations found in London.

This was Charles Chauvel's last feature film. He intended to adapt [[Kay Glasson Taylor]]'s novel ''The Wars of the Outer March''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18144464 |title=Mrs. Chauvel In Hollywood. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 December 1949 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was hired by the BBC to make the TV series ''Walkabout''. Before he could resume work on his feature projects he died on 11 November 1959.

'''Mary Maytham Kidd''' born '''Mary Catherine Maytham''' (24 January 1914 &amp;ndash; 8 April 2001 [[East London, Cape Province]]), daughter of Albert Archibald Maytham, was a South African botanical artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi2/index.php?table_name=dsi&amp;function=details&amp;where_field=id&amp;where_value=12655|title=DSI - Database of Scientific Illustrators|website=www.uni-stuttgart.de|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[East London, South Africa|East London]], she was educated at [[Roedean School (South Africa)|Roedean School]] in Johannesburg between 1927 and 1930 and, between 1931 and 1933, studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris. She also trained at the [[Royal Academy School]] in London from 1936 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peterkidd.org.uk/ind551.html|title=Mary Catherine MAYTHAM|website=peterkidd.org.uk|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kidd wrote and illustrated ''"Wild Flowers of the Cape Peninsula"'' (Cape Town 1950 - foreword by [[J. C. Smuts]]), two books on South African poisonous and edible fungi by Edith L. Stephens (Longmans, Cape Town 1953) and illustrated a series of booklets on protected wild flowers for the [[Cape Province]] Nature Conservation Department. Her 1950 work, ''"Wild Flowers of the Cape Peninsula"'', was recently republished as ''"Wild Flowers of the Table Mountain National Park"'',  by the  ''Botanical Society of South Africa''. She also created designs for porcelain, Christmas cards and calendars.

The [[University of Cape Town]] archives acquired her sketchbooks, diaries and other documents after her death. They show that she undertook a 1936 canoe trip down the [[Danube]] and visited [[Nyasaland]] and the [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]] Plateau in 1943. Much later in 1973/74, she spent some time in [[Suffolk]].

She married Hubert John Kidd (1896-1963), headmaster of the [[Diocesan College]] of Bishops in Rondebosch, on 28 May 1948. They adopted a child, Charles James Anthony Kidd (1942-2005). Mary died of [[congestive cardiac failure]] on 8 April 2001 in [[Maitland, Cape Town]].

'''Mayer Kirshenblatt''' (1916–2009) was a [[Canadian]] [[Jew]]ish painter and author.

==Biography==
Kirshenblatt was born in Apt (Yiddish)/ [[Opatów]] (Polish) Poland. He left Poland in 1934 and settled in Toronto, Canada, where he ran a paint and wallpaper store for many years. In 2007, he and his daughter [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] published ''They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood before the Holocaust'' (University of California Press in conjunction with the [[Judah L Magnes Museum]]). The book won the [[Canadian Jewish Book Award]], J. I. Segal Book Award, and American Association of University Presses (AAUP) award for book design, and was a finalist in three categories for the National Jewish Book Award. An exhibition of his work, which opened at the Magnes Museum in 2007, will travel to The Jewish Museum (New York City), Jewish Historical Museum (Amsterdam), and Museum of the History of Polish Jews (Warsaw). The book and exhibition are the culmination of a forty-year collaboration between father and daughter. In 1967, Barbara began interviewing Mayer about his childhood. In 1990, at the urging of his wife, daughter, and son-in-law [[Max Gimblett]], Mayer began to paint.

'''''Noisy Outlaws, Unfriendly Blobs, and Some Other Things That Aren't as Scary, Maybe, Depending on How You Feel About Lost Lands, Stray Cellphones, Creatures from the Sky, Parents Who Disappear in Peru, a Man Named Lars Farf, and One Other Story We Couldn't Quite Finish, So Maybe You Could Help Us Out''''', commonly shortened to the first two words, is a collection of short and long stories by noted authors such as [[Nick Hornby]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Jon Scieszka]] and others. The collection of short stories was published in 2005 by [[McSweeney's Books]]. The inside of the dust jacket cover of the book contains a half-page story, penned by [[Lemony Snicket]], left unfinished as a part of a contest for readers.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Denise (December 18, 2005). "[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/18/books/bk-hamilton18 All this, and Lemony Snicket too]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved April 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The book contains ten stories and one feature presented in comic book style.

The stories are not particularly intended for children, though the tone of the majority of stories suggests this. Instead, the stories focus on the apparent (and sometimes exaggerated) weirdness of the world with a childlike innocence.

The series starts with "Small Country", a short story about a "six or seven year old" reluctant football player who has just discovered how small his country really is.

"Lars Farf, excessively fearful father and husband" deals with the paranoia that cripples a father who cares a bit too much about the safety of his family.

"Monster" is the horror story in the ensemble that asks some deep questions in the guise of a camp fire tale.

"The contests at Cowlick" is an old fashioned western that has more in common with Aesop's fables than the gunslingers of past.

"Each sold separately" is a short story that is written in the form of a conversation between a boy and a girl entirely in the form of catchphrases from the advertising world.

In "Seymour's last wish", little Seymour gets a chance to fulfill his wishes. He also has an ogre for a mother, who loves kittens more than she loves him.

"Grimble" is a long story about a kid whose parents leave for Peru without notifying him first or telling him why. All they leave is notes, through which Grimble has to survive till they return.

"Spoony-E and Spandy E" is an illustrated comic book featuring two "War buddies" united against the imminent attack of the "purple horde".

"Sunbird" is about a club (the Epicureans) who intend to eat all the edible and inedible dishes in the world, including imaginary animals, in order to document all the tastes.

"The Aces phone" is about a lost phone found in a park by a boy.

"The Sixth Borough" is the final story of the collection, about the sixth borough of New York, (there are only five) and what happened to it.

Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref name="illuminatus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shea|first=Robert|author2=Robert Anton Wilson|title=Illuminatus!|publisher=Sphere Books|year=1976|isbn=978-0-7221-9208-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KsygAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=illuminatus!|accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Projects==
Current progress in Operation Mindfuck includes:
*OMGASM: A decentralized Discordian network which attempts to pool resources in order to complete larger projects. By using [[web 2.0]] tools to tag projects, Discordians hope to link up with other collaborators who will lend necessary skills to their efforts. OMGASM, which stands for Operation Mindfuck: Golden Apple Seed Missions, was started in early 2008 by the cabal residing at the principiadiscordia.com forums. Any Discordian may label a project a Golden Apple Seed Mission, indicating that other Discordians are welcome to participate and help propagate it. OMGASM has had several successful sub-projects.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

There are several projects involved in Operation Mindfuck (as outlined in Appendix Yod of ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''). These are:
*''Project Jake'': "Instigated by Harold Lord Randomfactor. Once or twice a year, a public servant who has distinguished himself by more than common imbecility is selected as target for a Jake and all Discordian cabals are alerted." The official being honored receives mail from all the cabals at once on Jake Day. The letters should be printed on the official letterhead of each of the cabals and ask for help in "some complicated political matter that passes all rational understanding."{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*''Project Eagle'': "Day-glo posters have been printed which look like the old Eagle proclamation saying TO THE POLLS YE SONS OF FREEDOM. The new, improved Discordian posters, however, have one slight word change, and say cheerfully BURN THE POLLS YE SONS OF FREEDOM. Like the old ones, they are posted in prominent places on election day."{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*''Project Pan-Pontification'': This project consists of the distribution of "[[Pope]] cards" claiming every man, woman, and child on Earth as a [[Discordianism#Popes|Pope of Discord]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*''Project Graffito'' (and ''Project Bumpersticker''): "Anybody can participate by inventing a particularly Erisian slogan and seeing that it is given wide distribution. Examples: ''Your Local Police Are Armed and Dangerous''; ''Legalize Free-Enterprise Murder''; ''Why Should Governments Have All the Fun?''; ''Smash the Government Postal Monopoly''; ''If Voting Could Change the System, It Would Be Against the Law''; etc."{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*''Citizens Against Drug Abuse'': "This organization possesses elegant letterheads and is engaged in a campaign of encouraging Congressmen to outlaw [[catnip]], a drug which some young people are smoking whenever [[marijuana]] is in short supply." The idea behind this is that because the government lost much credibility in its war on marijuana, a campaign to outlaw a "similar, but more comical herb" will result in a complete loss of faith in government.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The '''President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities''' ('''PCAH''') was an advisory committee to the [[White House]] on cultural issues. It worked directly with the Administration and the three primary cultural agencies: the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], as well as other federal partners and the private sector, to address policy questions in the arts and humanities, to initiate and support public/private partnerships in those disciplines, and to recognize excellence in the field. Its core areas of focus were arts and humanities education, cultural exchange, and the creative economy.

The committee was composed of both private and public members. The private members were appointed by the President and are prominent artists, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and state and local public officials who demonstrated commitment to the arts and humanities. Its public [[Ex officio member|ex officio]] members included the heads of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]; the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services|Institute of Museum and Library Sciences]]; the Departments of [[United States Department of Education|Education]], [[Department of the Interior|Interior]], and [[Department of State|State]]; the [[National Gallery of Art]]; the [[Smithsonian Institution]]; the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]; and the [[Library of Congress]]. The President also appointed a chairman or co-chairmen from among the private members.&lt;ref name="pcah-members"&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=https://www.pcah.gov/members|website=President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, all private committee members resigned in protest of President [[Donald Trump]]'s response to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="wapo-18aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Ed|title=Members of White House presidential arts commission resigning to protest Trump’s comments|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/18/members-of-white-house-presidential-arts-commission-resign-to-protest-trumps-comments/|accessdate=August 18, 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scribd-18aug2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the President's Commission on Arts &amp; Humanities resignation letter to President Trump|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/356620864/Members-of-the-President-s-Commission-on-Arts-Humanities-resignation-letter-to-President-Trump|website=[[Scribd]]|date=August 18, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes-18aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamal|first1=Sameea|last2=Bierman|first2=Noah|title=16 members of White House arts panel resign to protest Trump's response to Charlottesville|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-members-of-a-white-house-panel-on-arts-1503065476-htmlstory.html|accessdate=August 18, 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authority for the Committee subsequently lapsed on September 30 under the provisions of Executive Order 13708.

==Background==
The PCAH was established by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12367 of June 15, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12367.html|title=Executive Orders {{!}} Executive Order 12367--President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities|last=|first=|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|access-date=2017-08-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has conducted major research and policy analysis, and catalyzed important federal cultural programs, both domestic and international. PCAH's website states, "These achievements rely on the PCAH's unique role in bringing together the White House, federal agencies, civic organizations, corporations, foundations and individuals to strengthen the United States' national investment in its cultural life. Central to the PCAH mission is using the power of the arts and humanities to contribute to the vibrancy of our society, the education of our children, the creativity of our citizens and the strength of our democracy."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcah.gov/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current programs==

===Turnaround Arts===
Turnaround Arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://turnaroundarts.pcah.gov/ Turnaround Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; was a national program that brings arts education to high-poverty elementary and middle schools across the country. It was the first federal program to specifically support arts education as an improvement tool in the country’s lowest-performing schools, and was run by the PCAH, in coordination with the White House, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE), and several foundations.

===National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards===
The National Arts and Humanities Youth Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahyp.org/ National Arts and Humanities Youth Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Awards recognized the country’s best creative youth development programs for increasing academic achievement, graduation rates and college enrollment by engaging children and youth in the arts and humanities. Formerly titled Coming Up Taller, these annual awards focused national attention on outstanding programs across the country that promoted the creativity of America's young people, providing them learning opportunities and the chance to contribute to their communities. Accompanied by a cash award and a ceremony at the White House with the First Lady, the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards not only rewarded these projects with recognition but also provided organizational and capacity building support over the course of the year.

===National Student Poets Program===
The PCAH, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the nonprofit Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers partnered to present the National Student Poets Program (NSPP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandwriting.org/the-awards/national-student-poets-program/ National Student Poets Program (NSPP)]&lt;/ref&gt; the nation’s highest honor for young poets (grades 9-11) presenting original work. Five students were annually selected for one year of service as literary ambassadors, each representing a geographic region of the country. By elevating and showcasing their work for a national audience, the program strived to inspire other young people to achieve excellence in their own creative endeavors and promote the essential role of writing and the arts in academic and personal success.

===Film Forward===
Sundance Film Forward is an international touring program designed to enhance greater cultural understanding, collaboration and dialogue around the globe by engaging audiences through the exhibition of films, workshops and conversations with filmmakers. Sundance Film Forward is an initiative of the Sundance Institute, which partnered with the PCAH and other federal arts programs.

===Save America's Treasures===
Established by Executive Order in 1998, Save America's Treasures (SAT)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archfoundation.org/category/save-americas-treasures/ Save America's Treasures (SAT)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a federal public-private partnership that includes the NEA, NEH, IMLS, the National Park Service (NPS), the American Architectural Foundation (AAF) and formerly the PCAH. The PCAH and the National Park Service jointly oversaw the management of the federal competitive matching grant component, which helps preserve, conserve, and rescue our nation's most significant cultural and heritage resources, including historic structures, collections of artifacts, works of art, maps, manuscripts, and sound recordings. Although funding for the program was suspended, the PCAH and AAF convened a series of thought leadership forums to develop elements for framing and catalyzing a preservation strategy that built on the strengths and success of SAT.

===Special initiatives===
Through its work with the private sector, the PCAH was able to raise private resources, which were directed to special initiatives that supported youth programs, recognized artists, broadened arts awareness, and celebrated the nation’s cultural life. Examples include:

* Educational workshops and cultural events programming at the White House
* The National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medals
* Annual NEH Jefferson Lecture on the Humanities
* U.S. Cultural and Heritage Tourism Summit (2005)

==August 2017 resignations==
On August 18, 2017, 16 of the 17 committee members, including [[Kal Penn]] and [[Chuck Close]], resigned in protest of [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's]] response to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The resigning commissioners stated in a letter to the President, "Reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following your support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow Americans in Charlottesville."&lt;ref name="wapo-18aug2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scribd-18aug2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes-18aug2017" /&gt;
The initial letters of each paragraph of the resignation letter spell 'RESIST'. The only member of the committee who did not sign the letter was theater and film director [[George C. Wolfe]], whose representatives stated that he, too, would be resigning and would add his name to the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Citing Trump remarks, most of president's arts council quits |url=http://wjla.com/news/entertainment/citing-trump-remarks-most-of-presidents-arts-council-quits-08-18-2017 |accessdate=August 18, 2017 |work=WJLA |agency=AP |date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCAH became the first White House department to quit the Trump administration.&lt;ref name="vecono" &gt;{{cite news|title=The White House has become a cultural wasteland|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/08/artless-dealings|work=[[The Economist]]|author=E.W.|date=28 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House responded with a statement reading in part, "Earlier this month it was decided that President Trump will not renew the Executive Order for the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH), which expires later this year."&lt;ref name="cbs-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bat|first1=John|title=Arts and Humanities Committee members resign in protest of Trump|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arts-and-humanities-committee-members-resign-in-protest-of-trump/|accessdate=August 19, 2017|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pyramid of Capitalist System''' is a common name of a 1911 American [[cartoon]] [[caricature]] [[criticism of capitalism|critical of capitalism]], closely based on a Russian flyer of {{circa}} 1900.&lt;ref name="Bendix1980"/&gt; The graphic focus is on [[social stratification]] by [[social class]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=laborarts/&gt; The work has been described as "famous",&lt;ref name="Mulgan2013"/&gt; "well-known and widely reproduced".&lt;ref name=Krieger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krieger|first=N|title=Ladders, pyramids and champagne: the iconography of health inequities|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|date=1 December 2008|volume=62|issue=12|pages=1098–1104|doi=10.1136/jech.2008.079061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[derivative work]]s exist.&lt;ref&gt;Consider a number of modern derivative works found at the following websites:

It was published in the 1911 edition of ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' (The International Publishing Co., [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], U.S.), a newspaper of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], and attributed to "Nedeljkovich, Brashich, &amp; Kuharich".&lt;ref name="Health2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Krieger Professor Harvard School of Public Health|title=Epidemiology and the People's Health : Theory and Context: Theory and Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z59ciXRRaPsC&amp;pg=PA338|date=23 March 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975035-1|pages=338–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lange2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristina Lange|title=Historisches Bildverstehen oder Wie lernen Schüler mit Bildquellen?: ein Beitrag zur geschichtsdidaktischen Lehr-Lern-Forschung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvSZLDF89tIC&amp;pg=PA189|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-11354-2|pages=189–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laborarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laborarts.org/collections/item.cfm?itemid=428 |title=Labor Arts |publisher=Labor Arts |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture shows a literal "social pyramid" or hierarchy, with the wealthy few on the top, and the impoverished masses at the bottom. Crowned with a [[money bag]] representing [[capitalism]], the top layer, "we rule you", is occupied by the [[Royal family|royalty]] and state leaders. Underneath them are the [[clergy]] ("we fool you"), followed by the military ("we shoot at you"), and the [[bourgeoisie]] ("we eat for you"). The bottom of the pyramid is held by the workers ("we work for all... we feed all").&lt;ref name="Mulgan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marino2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Marino|title=Early Modern History and the Social Sciences: Testing the Limits of Braudel's Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zTwxlJoAocC&amp;pg=PA121|year=2002|publisher=Truman State Univ Press|isbn=978-1-931112-06-2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laborarts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt;

The work is based on an anonymous 1900 caricature of the [[Russian Empire]] hierarchy by the [[Union of Russian Socialists]].&lt;ref name="Bendix1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reinhard Bendix|title=Kings Or People: Power and the Mandate to Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxAb4kAtzMYC&amp;pg=PA540|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04090-8|page=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hingley1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Hingley|title=A concise history of Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pewrAQAAIAAJ|date=1 March 1972|publisher=Viking Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original picture showed workers supporting the pyramid on their backs, with the [[stanza]]: "The time will come when the people in their fury will straighten their bent backs and bring down the structure with one mighty push of their shoulders."&lt;ref name="Bendix1980"/&gt; Notable differences between the Russian 1900 original and the American 1911 derivative version include the replacement of the Russian Empire's black eagle with a money bag, the [[Russian tsar]] and tsarina with a more generic trio of figures (a monarch and state leaders in suits), two of the three [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Catholic]] [[Cardinal (catholicism)|cardinal]] and a [[Protestant]] minister, and the Russian Empire army with a more generic group of soldiers; the workers are no longer bent and no revolutionary stanza is present. On both pictures, a fallen child or [[child worker]] symbolizes the plight of the workers.&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt; Another shared element is a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] raised amongst the workers, symbolizing the emergence of the [[socialist movement]].&lt;ref name="Nordin1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rune Nordin|title=Fackföreningsrörelsen i Sverige: Uppkomst och utveckling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZppIAAAAYAAJ|year=1981|publisher=Prisma i samarbete med Landsorganisationen i Sverige|isbn=978-91-518-1470-4|page=28|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The basic message of the image is the critique of the capitalist system, with its hierarchy of power and wealth. It also illustrates that the working class is supporting all others, and if it would withdraw their support from the system it could, literally, topple the existing social order.&lt;ref name=laborarts/&gt; This type of [[criticism of capitalism]] is attributed to the French socialist [[Louis Blanc]].&lt;ref name="Mulgan2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Mulgan|title=The Locust and the Bee: Predators and Creators in Capitalism's Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4gXkeGQkj4C&amp;pg=PA80|date=27 February 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-4665-X|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red pigment made from [[ochre]] was one of the first colors used in [[prehistoric art]]. The Ancient Egytians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories.  It was also an important color in China, where it was used to colour early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319395390|title=Chinese red|last=Chunling|first=Y.|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|year=2008|isbn=9787119045313|location=Beijing|oclc=319395390}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|60-61}} In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] and [[cochineal]]. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red also became the color of revolution; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.

Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color of symbolizing happiness and good fortune.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques|last=Heller|first=Eva|date=1948|publisher=Pyramid|isbn=9782350171562|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=470802996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|39-63}}

[[Primates]] can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans, but many kinds of mammals, such as dogs and cattle, have [[dichromacy]], which means they can see blues and yellows, but cannot distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray).

=== In color theory and on a computer screen ===
On the [[color wheel]] long used by painters, and in traditional color theory, red is one of the three [[primary colors]], along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet:  [[Cennino Cennini]], in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, "If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac [red lake], ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder" he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue [[indigo]] and red [[hematite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/cennino-cenninis-i-il-libro-dellarte-i/?id=224|title=Cennino Cennini's Il libro dell'arte: a new English translation and commentary with Italian transcription|last=|first=|publisher=Archetype|year=2015|isbn=9781909492288|editor-last=Broecke|editor-first=Lara|location=London|pages=115|oclc=910400601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern color theory, also known as the [[RGB color model]], red, green and blue are [[additive primary colors]]. Red, green and blue light combined together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television.  For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using [[additive colors]] and light instead of pigment:  it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen.  Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.&lt;ref name="huevaluechroma1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/041.php|title=The Dimensions of Colour: Part 4. Additive Mixing|last=Briggs|first=David|date=|website=huevaluechroma.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen, each color has been given a code number, or [[sRGB]], which tells your computer the intensity of the red, green and blue components of that color. The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255, which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades. The sRGB number of pure red, for example, is 255, 00, 00, which means the red component is at its maximum intensity, and there is no green or blue. The sRGB number for crimson is 220, 20, 60, which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker, there is some green, which leans it toward orange; and there is a larger amount of blue, which makes it slightly blue-violet.&lt;ref name="huevaluechroma1" /&gt;

=== Color of sunset ===
[[File:Crimson sunset.jpg|Sunsets and sunrises are often red because of an optical effect called [[Rayleigh scattering]].|thumb|right]]
As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particles]] due to [[Rayleigh scattering]], changing the final color of the beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye.&lt;ref name="saha"&gt;{{cite book |author=K. Saha |title=The Earth's Atmosphere – Its Physics and Dynamics |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-78426-5 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow.&lt;ref name="guenther"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Optics|last=|first=|publisher=Elsevier|year=2005|isbn=9780123693952|editor-last=Guenther|editor-first=B.|volume=1|location=|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lasers ===
[[Laser]]s emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the [[ruby laser]] in 1960. In 1962 the red [[helium–neon laser]] was invented,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=A. D.|last2=Rigden|first2=J.

US Patent 3242439.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including [[holography]], and in education. Red helium–neon lasers were used commercially in [[LaserDisc]] players. The use of red [[laser diode]]s became widespread with the commercial success of modern [[DVD]] players, which use a 660&amp;nbsp;nm laser diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive [[laser pointer]]s. Portable, high-powered versions are also available for various applications.&lt;ref name="laserglow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laserglow.com/GRH|title=Laserglow – Blue, Red, Yellow, Green Lasers|last=|first=|date=|website=Laserglow.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805054301/https://www.laserglow.com/GRH|archive-date=Aug 5, 2011|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Sep 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, 671&amp;nbsp;nm diode-pumped solid state ([[DPSS]]) lasers have been introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, [[particle image velocimetry]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], and holography.&lt;ref name="laserglow2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/GRH |title=Laserglow&amp;nbsp;– Lab/OEM Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red's wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early [[compact disc]] technologies, are being replaced by blue lasers, as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbyte.com/common/dvd_7.htm|title=DVD|last=|first=|date=|website=usbyte.com|publisher=eMag Solutions LLC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106063624/http://www.usbyte.com/common/dvd_7.htm|archive-date=Jan 6, 2010|dead-url=yes|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Red giant]]s are stars that have exhausted the supply of [[hydrogen]] in their cores and switched to [[thermonuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the [[Sun]]. However, their outer envelope is much lower in temperature, giving them an orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun due to their large size.

Because they are shrinking rapidly in size, they are surrounded by an envelope or skin much bigger than the star itself. The envelope of Betelgeuse is 250 times bigger than the star inside.
* A [[red dwarf]] is a small and relatively [[temperature|cool]] [[star]], which has a mass of less than half that of the [[Sun]] and a surface temperature of less than 4,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]].

=== Red lac, red lake and crimson lake ===
[[File:Titian - The Vendramin Family Venerating a Relic of the True Cross (detail) - WGA22811.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]] used glazes of red lake to create the vivid crimson of the robes in ''The Vendramin Family Venerating a Relic of the True Cross'', completed 1550–60 (detail).]]
'''Red lac''', also called '''red lake''', '''crimson lake''' or '''carmine lake''', was an important red pigment in Renaissance and Baroque art. Since it was translucent, thin layers of red lac were built up or glazed over a more opaque dark color to create a particularly deep and vivid color.

Unlike [[vermilion]] or red [[ochre]], made from minerals, red [[lake pigments]] are made by mixing organic dyes, made from insects or plants, with white [[chalk]] or [[alum]]. Red lac was made from the gum [[lac]], the dark red resinous substance secreted by various scale insects, particularly the [[Laccifer lacca]] from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New World dictionary of American English|last=|first=|publisher=Webster's New World|year=1988|isbn=0131926594|editor-last=Neufeldt|editor-first=V.|edition=3rd college|location=Cleveland|pages=|oclc=36197258|editor-last2=Guralnik|editor-first2=D.

Red lake pigments were an important part of the palette of 16th-century Venetian painters,  particularly [[Titian]], but they were used in all periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9781857094428/closer-look-colour|title=Colour|last=Bomford|first=David|last2=Ashok|first2=Roy|date=2009|publisher=National Gallery Co.|year=|isbn=9781857094428|edition=Rev.|location=London|pages=41-42|oclc=280440129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the red lakes were made from organic dyes, they tended to be fugitive, becoming unstable and fading when exposed to sunlight.

The most common synthetic food coloring today is [[Allura Red AC]] is a red [[azo dye]] that goes by several names including: '''Allura Red''', '''Food Red 17''', '''C.I. 16035''', '''FD&amp;C Red 40''',&lt;ref name="Shampoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/col-221.html |title=From Shampoo to Cereal: Seeing to the Safety of Color Additives |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115194446/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/col-221.html |archivedate=January 15, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Colour Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/colorfac.html|title=Food Color Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001050645/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/colorfac.html|archivedate=October 1, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally manufactured from coal tar, but now is mostly made from petroleum.

In Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France and Switzerland, and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001050645/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/colorfac.html|title=E129|last=|first=|date=2007|website=The UK Food Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant, but EU countries' local laws banning food colorants are preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Jun 30, 1994|title=European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC on colours for use in foodstuffs|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1994/36/oj|journal=European Parliament and Council of the European Union|volume=|pages=|postscript=.

In the United States, Allura Red AC is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in [[cosmetics]], [[drugs]], and food. It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products, such as [[soft drink]]s, children's medications, and [[cotton candy]]. On June 30, 2010, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI) called for the FDA to ban Red 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/30/food-dyes-a-health-risk/|title=Group urges ban of 3 common dyes|last=Young|first=Saundra|date=Jun 30, 2010|work=CNN|access-date=Jul 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703013023/http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/30/food-dyes-a-health-risk/|archive-date=Jul 3, 2010|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes, many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as [[carmine]], made from crushing the tiny female [[cochineal]] insect. This insect, originating in Mexico and Central American, was used to make the brilliant [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] dyes of the European Renaissance.

=== Autumn leaves ===
The red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called [[anthocyanin]]s. They are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer.&lt;ref name="tree1044" /&gt; They develop in late summer in the [[sap]] of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences—both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of [[phosphate]] in the leaf is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant pigments and their manipulation|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=|isbn=1405117370|editor-last=Davies|editor-first=Kevin M.|location=Oxford|pages=6|oclc=56963804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the [[sugar]]s manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the [[Plant stem|stem]] of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.

Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young [[leaves]] as they unfold from the [[bud]]s in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[Red Delicious|red apples]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[plums]].

Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas—a [[autumn in New England|famous example being New England]]—up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment.&lt;ref name="tree1044" /&gt; In autumn forests they appear vivid in the [[maple]]s, [[oak]]s, [[sourwood]], [[Liquidambar|sweetgums]], [[dogwood]]s, [[tupelo]]s, [[cherry]] trees and [[persimmon]]s. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species. (See [[Autumn leaf color]]).

=== Blood and other reds in nature ===
Oxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated [[hemoglobin]] that contains iron molecules, with the iron components reflecting red light.&lt;ref name="UCSBblood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why is blood red? |url=http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2419 |website=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm|title=Hemoglobin|last=Nabili|first=Siamak|date=|website=Procedures and Tests|publisher=MedicineNet|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323145336/http://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm|archive-date=Mar 23, 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Apr 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red meat gets its color from the iron found in the [[myoglobin]] and hemoglobin in the muscles and residual blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=H.

Plants like [[apples]], [[Garden strawberry|strawberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[tomato]]es, [[Capsicum|peppers]], and [[pomegranate]]s are often colored by forms of [[carotenoids]], red pigments that also assist [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss3/pigments.html |title=Photosynthetic Pigments |last=Speer |first=Brian |website=UCMP Glossary |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=22 April 2010 |location=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* When used to describe natural animal coloration, "red" usually refers to a brownish, reddish-brown or ginger color. In this sense it is used to describe coat colors of reddish-brown cattle and dogs, and in the names of various animal species or breeds such as [[red fox]], [[red squirrel]], [[red deer]], [[European robin]], [[red grouse]], [[red knot]], [[redstart]], [[redwing]], [[red setter]], Red Devon cattle, etc. This reddish-brown color is also meant when using the terms [[red ochre]] and red hair.
* The red herring dragged across a trail to destroy the scent gets its color from the heavy salting and slow smoking of the fish, which results in a warm, brown color.
* When used for flowers, red often refers to purplish (red deadnettle, red clover, red helleborine) or pink (red campion, red valerian) colors.

=== Hair color ===
[[File:Woman redhead natural portrait 1.jpg|thumb|Woman with red hair]]
'''Red hair''' occurs naturally on approximately 1–2% of the human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm?action=chapters&amp;id=20|title=Red Alert!|last=Garreau|first=Joel|date=Mar 18, 2002|website=The Garreau Group|publisher=The Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527035304/http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm?action=chapters&amp;id=20|archive-date=May 27, 2013|dead-url=yes|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in people with two copies of a [[Dominance relationship|recessive gene]] on [[chromosome 16]] which causes a mutation in the [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC1R]] protein.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Red hair varies from a deep [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] through [[Orange (color)#Burnt orange|burnt orange]] to bright [[Copper (color)|copper]]. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment [[pheomelanin]] (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment [[eumelanin]]. The term '''redhead''' (originally ''redd hede''){{citation needed|date=May 2017}} has been in use since at least 1510. Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered. (See [[red hair]]).

=== In animal and human behavior ===
Red is associated with [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] in a number of animal species.&lt;ref name="Little &amp; Hill 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=A. C.|last2=Hill|first2=R.

=== Prehistory ===
Inside cave 13B at [[Pinnacle Point]], an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa, [[paleoanthropologists]] in 2000 found evidence that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, [[Late Stone Age]] people were scraping and grinding [[ochre]], a clay colored red by [[iron oxide]], probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies.&lt;ref name="Marean 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=C.

Red [[hematite]] powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a [[Zhoukoudian]] cave complex near [[Beijing]]. The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago. The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|4}}

Red, black and white were the first colors used by artists in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age, probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived. [[Rubia|Madder]], a plant whose root could be made into a red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le petit livre des couleurs|last=Pastoureau|first=Michel|last2=Simonnet|first2=Dominique|date=2014|publisher=Seuil|year=|isbn=9782757841532|location=Paris|pages=32|oclc=881055677}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cave of Altamira]] in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC.

A red dye called [[Kermes (dye)|Kermes]] was made beginning in the [[Neolithic Period]] by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny [[scale insect]] in the genus ''[[Kermes (genus)|Kermes]]'', primarily ''[[Kermes vermilio]]''. The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially [[Kermes oak]] trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prehistoric Textiles|last=Barber|first=E. J.

A different variety of dye was made from [[Armenian cochineal|''Porphyrophora hamelii'' (Armenian cochineal)]] scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A perfect red|last=Greenfield|first=Amy Butler|date=2005|publisher=Autrement|year=|isbn=9782746710948|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=470600856}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|45}}

Kermes is also mentioned in the [[Bible]]. In the [[Book of Exodus]], [[God]] instructs [[Moses]] to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth "of blue, and purple, and scarlet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+25:4&amp;version=KJV|title=Exodus 25:4 - King James Version|last=|first=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 23, 2018|quote=And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, (...).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term used for scarlet in the 4th-century [[Latin Vulgate]] version of the Bible passage is ''coccumque bis tinctum'', meaning "colored twice with coccus."

=== Ancient history ===
In ancient Egypt, red was associated with life, health, and victory. Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/reds.html |title=Pigments through the Ages – Intro to the reds |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian women used red ochre as a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] to redden cheeks and lips&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Egypt: The Kingdom of the Pharaohs|last=Hamilton|first=R.|date=2007|publisher=Paragon Inc.|year=|isbn=9781405486439|location=Bath|pages=62|oclc=144618068}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also used [[henna]] to color their hair and paint their nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100788210|title=Sacred luxuries|last=Manniche|first=Lise|date=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0801437202|location=New York|pages=127-43|oclc=41319991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, like many colors, it also had a negative association, with heat, destruction and evil. A prayer to god [[Isis]] states: "Oh Isis, protect me from all things evil and red."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|45}} The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC. Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings, particularly as the skin color of men. An ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]] had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors. The Egyptians used the root of the [[rubia]], or madder plant, to make a dye, later known as [[alizarin]], and also used it as a pigment, which became known as [[madder lake]], alizarin or alizarin crimson.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bright Earth: the Invention of Colour|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=2001|publisher=Viking|year=|isbn=0670893463|location=London|pages=100|oclc=48363546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient China, artisans were making red and black painted [[pottery]] as early as the [[Yangshao Culture]] period (5000–3000 BC). A red-painted wooden bowl was found at a [[Neolithic]] site in Yuyao, Zhejiang. Other red-painted ceremonial objects have been found at other sites dating to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770–221 BC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the [[Han dynasty]] (200 BC–200 AD) Chinese craftsmen made a red pigment, [[lead tetroxide]], which they called ''ch-ien tan'', by heating lead white pigment. Like the Egyptians, they made a red dye from the madder plant to color silk fabric for gowns and used pigments colored with madder to make red lacquerware.

[[Red lead]] or Lead tetroxide pigment was widely used as the red in Persian and Indian miniature paintings as well as in European art, where it was called minium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In India, the [[rubia]] plant has been used to make dye since ancient times. A piece of cotton dyed with rubia dated to the third millennium BC was found at an archaeological site at [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name="bhardwaj&amp;jain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhardwaj|first=H.

The early inhabitants of America had their own vivid crimson [[dye]], made from the [[cochineal]], an insect of the same family as the Kermes of Europe and the Middle East, which feeds on the [[Opuntia]], or prickly pear cactus plant. Red-dyed textiles from the [[Paracas culture]] (800–100 BC) have been found in tombs in [[Peru]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Red also featured in the burials of royalty in the Maya city-states.

In [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Minoan civilization]] of ancient [[Crete]], red was widely used in murals and in the [[polychrome]] decoration of temples and palaces. The Greeks began using [[red lead]] as a pigment.

In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Tyrian purple]] was the color of the Emperor, but red had an important religious symbolism. Romans wore [[togas]] with red stripes on holidays, and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl, called a ''flammeum''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|46}} Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators. Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a [[paludamentum]] which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] or purple. In [[Roman mythology]] red is associated with the god of war, [[Mars (god)|Mars]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colour|last=Feisner|first=Edith A.|date=2006|publisher=Laurence King|year=|isbn=1856694410|edition=2nd|location=London|pages=127|oclc=62259546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vexilloid]] of the [[Roman Empire]] had a red background with the letters [[SPQR]] in [[Gold (color)|gold]].

The Romans liked bright colors, and many [[Roman villas]] were decorated with vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called [[vermilion]], and it came from the mineral [[cinnabar]], a common ore of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. It was one of the finest reds of ancient times – the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near [[Almadén]], southwest of [[Madrid]], in Spain. Working in the mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles and Methods of Toxicology |edition=5th |author=Hayes, A.

=== Postclassical history ===

==== In Europe ====
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, red was adopted as a color of majesty and authority by the [[Byzantine Empire]], the princes of Europe, and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It also played an important part in the rituals of the [[Catholic Church]] – it symbolized the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs – and it associated the power of the kings with the sacred rituals of the Church.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor [[Charlemagne]] painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|36-37}} Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red colored [[Religious habit|habitus]]. When [[Abbe Suger]] rebuilt [[Saint Denis Basilica]] outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added [[stained glass]] windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both [[Christ]] and the [[Virgin Mary]] were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

Red clothing was a sign of status and wealth. It was worn not only by cardinals and princes, but also by merchants, artisans and townspeople, particularly on holidays or special occasions. Red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the [[rubia tinctorum]], the madder plant. This color leaned toward brick-red, and faded easily in the sun or during washing. The wealthy and aristocrats wore [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] clothing dyed with [[kermes (dye)|kermes]], or [[carmine]], made from the [[carminic acid]] in tiny female [[scale insects]], which lived on the leaves of oak trees in Eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. The insects were gathered, dried, crushed, and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process, which produced a brilliant scarlet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|38-45}}

[[Brazilin]] was another popular red dye in the Middle Ages. It came from the [[sapanwood]] tree, which grew in India, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. A similar tree, [[brazilwood]], grew on the coast of South America. The red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an [[alkaline]] solution to make dye and pigment. It became one of the most profitable exports from the [[New World]], and gave its name to the nation of Brazil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|38-45}}

==== In Asia ====
Red has been an important color in Chinese culture, religion, industry, fashion and court ritual since ancient times.
Silk was woven and dyed as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 BC). China had a monopoly on the manufacture of silk until the 6th century AD, when it was introduced into the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th century, it was introduced into Europe.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples|last=Varichon|first=Anne|date=2000|publisher=Seuil|year=|isbn=2020381095|location=Paris|oclc=300129030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Han Dynasty, Chinese red was a light red, but during the [[Tang dynasty]] new dyes and pigments were discovered. The Chinese used several different plants to make red dyes, including the flowers of the [[safflour]] (''Carthamus tinctorius''), the thorns and stems of a variety of [[sorghum]] plant called Kao-liang, and the wood of the [[sappanwood]] tree. For pigments, they used [[cinnabar]], which produced the famous vermillion or "Chinese red" of Chinese [[lacquerware]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|111}}

Red played an important role in Chinese philosophy. It was believed that the world was composed of five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth, and that each had a color. Red was associated with fire. Each Emperor chose the color that his fortune-tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign. During the Zhou, Han, Jin, Song and Ming Dynasties, red was considered a noble color, and it was featured in all court ceremonies, from coronations to sacrificial offerings, and weddings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|26}}

Red was also a badge of rank. During the [[Song dynasty]] (906–1279), officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes; those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red; those of the sixth and seventh wore green; and the eighth and ninth wore blue. Red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor, and the color of the carriages of the imperial family. When the imperial family traveled, their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas. Of an official who had talent and ambition, it was said "he is so red he becomes purple."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|26}}

Red was also featured in Chinese Imperial architecture. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, gates of palaces were usually painted red, and nobles often painted their entire mansion red. One of the most famous works of Chinese literature, ''A Dream of Red Mansions'' by [[Cao Xueqin]] (1715–63), was about the lives of noble women who passed their lives out of public sight within the walls of such mansions. In later dynasties red was reserved for the walls of temples and imperial residences. When the [[Manchu]] rulers of the [[Qing Dynasty]] conquered the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and took over the [[Forbidden City]] and Imperial Palace in Beijing, all the walls, gates, beams and pillars were painted in red and gold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|36-37}}

Red is not often used in traditional Chinese paintings, which are usually black ink on white paper with a little green sometimes added for trees or plants; but the round or square seals which contain the name of the artist are traditionally red.

=== Modern history ===

==== In the 16th and 17th centuries ====
In [[Renaissance]] painting, red was used to draw the attention of the viewer; it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of [[Christ]], the [[Virgin Mary]], or another central figure. In [[Venice]], [[Titian]] was the master of fine reds, particularly [[vermilion]]; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more luminous color.

During the Renaissance trade routes were opened to the New World, to Asia and the Middle East, and new varieties of red pigment and dye were imported into Europe, usually through [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] or [[Seville]], and [[Marseille]]. Venice was the major depot importing and manufacturing pigments for artists and dyers from the end of the 15th century; the catalog of a Venetian ''Vendecolori'', or pigment seller, from 1534 included vermilion and [[kermes (dye)|kermes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11413/chapter/3|title=Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis|last=Berrie|first=Barbara H.|last2=Matthew|first2=Louisa C.|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=12-26|chapter=Material Innovation and Artistic Invention: New Materials and New Colors in Renaissance Venetian Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://filipvermeylen.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pu_Arti_TIAM-Vermeylen-pp.356_365-LR2.pdf|title=Trade in Artists' Materials: Markets and Commerce in Europe to 1700|last=Vermeylen|first=Filip|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Kirby|editor-first=J.|location=London|pages=359|chapter=The Colour of Money: Dealing in Pigments in Sixteenth-Century Antwerp|editor-last2=Cannon|editor-first2=J.|editor-last3=Nash|editor-first3=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The [[Rubia]] plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was kermes, made from a tiny [[scale insect]] which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was [[Polish Cochineal]]; also known as ''Kermes vermilio'' or "Blood of Saint John", which was made from a related insect, the ''Margodes polonicus''. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the "Kermes" of Armenia ([[Armenian cochineal]], also known as Persian ''kirmiz''), made by collecting and crushing ''Porphyophora hamelii'', an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called [[Venetian red]], which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was [[arsenic]], which brightened the color.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

But early in the 16th century, a brilliant new red appeared in Europe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|64-100}} When the [[Spanish conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] and his soldiers conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] in 1519–21, they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold; they had the tiny [[cochineal]], a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants, which, when dried and crushed, made a magnificent red. The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe, but unlike European Kermes, it could be harvested several times a year, and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland. It worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain. Soon cochineal began to arrive in European ports aboard convoys of Spanish [[galleons]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|64-100}}

At first the guilds of dyers in Venice and other cities banned cochineal to protect their local  products, but the superior quality of cochineal dye made it impossible to resist. By the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals, bankers, courtesans and aristocrats.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or [[alum]], kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and [[madder lake]], made from the [[rubia tinctorum]] plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, [[carmine]], which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including [[Rembrandt]], [[Vermeer]], [[Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Tintoretto]]. Later it was used by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Seurat]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|102-05}}

==== In the 18th and 19th centuries ====
During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Jacobins]] and other more radical parties adopted the red flag;  it was taken from red flags hoisted by the French government to declare a state of siege or emergency.   Many of them wore a red [[Phrygian cap]], or liberty cap, modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in Ancient Rome. During the height of the [[Reign of Terror]], Women wearing red caps gathered around the [[guillotine]] to celebrate each execution. They were called the "Furies of the guillotine". The guillotines used during the Reign of Terror in 1792 and 1793 were painted red, or made of red wood. During the Reign of Terror a statue of a woman titled liberty, painted red, was placed in the square in front of the guillotine. After the end of the Reign of Terror, France went back to the blue, white and red tricolor, whose red was taken from the red and blue colors of the city of Paris, and was the traditional color of Saint [[Denis]], the Christian martyr and patron saint of Paris.

In the mid-19th century, red became the color of a new political and social movement, [[socialism]]. It became the most common banner of the worker's movement, of the [[French Revolution of 1848]], of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1870, and of socialist parties across Europe. (see red flags and revolution section below).

As the [[Industrial Revolution]] spread across Europe, chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large-scale manufacture of textiles. One popular color imported into Europe from Turkey and India in the 18th and early 19th century was [[Turkey red]], known in France as ''rouge d'Adrinople''. Beginning in the 1740s, this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used [[Rubia|madder]] as the colorant, but the process was longer and more complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to [[carmine]], perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America. In 19th-century America, it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork [[quilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/lowengard/C_Chap36.html#txt7|title=The Creation of Color in Eighteenth-Century Europe|last=Lowengard|first=Sarah|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, the French chemist [[Pierre-Jean Robiquet]] discovered the organic compound [[alizarin]], the powerful coloring ingredient of the madder root, the most popular red dye of the time.  In 1868, German chemists [[Carl Graebe]] and [[Liebermann]] were able to synthesize alizarin, and to produce it from [[coal tar]]. The synthetic red was cheaper and more lasting than the natural dye, and the plantation of madder in Europe and import of cochineal from Latin America soon almost completely ceased.

The 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colour and Culture: Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction|last=Gage|first=John|date=1993|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=|isbn=9782878112955|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=494388115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Describing his painting, The ''Night Cafe'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Corréspondénce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== In the 20th and 21st centuries ====
In the 20th century, red was the color of Revolution; it was the color of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and of the Chinese Revolution of 1949, and later of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Red was the color of [[Communist Parties]] from Eastern Europe to [[Cuba]] to [[Vietnam]].

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the German chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments: [[cadmium red]], which was the color of natural vermilion, and mars red, which was a synthetic red ochre, the color of the very first natural red pigment.

The French painter [[Henri Matisse]] (1869–1954) was one of the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red. He even tried, without success, to persuade the older and more traditional [[Renoir]], his neighbor in the south of France, to switch from vermilion to cadmium red.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=2010|publisher=Hazan|year=|isbn=9782754105033|location=Paris|pages=|language=fr|oclc=717877902}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|440}}

Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting, chosen to evoke emotions. "A certain blue penetrates your soul", he wrote. "A certain red affects your blood pressure."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{Rp|437}} He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors, such as red and green, strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other. He wrote, "My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory; it is based on observation, upon feelings, upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{Rp|440}}

Later in the century, the American artist [[Mark Rothko]] (1903–70) also used red, in even simpler form, in blocks of dark, somber color on large canvases, to inspire deep emotions. Rothko observed that color was "only an instrument;" his interest was "in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books/about/Mark_Rothko_1903_1970.html?id=Yo7qAAAAMAAJ|title=Mark Rothko, 1903-1970|last=Rothko|first=Mark|date=1987|publisher=Tate Gallery|year=|isbn=0946590621|location=London|pages=|oclc=18961969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothko also began using the new synthetic pigments, but not always with happy results. In 1962 he donated to Harvard University a series of large murals of the Passion of Christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson. He mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson; synthetic ultramarine, cerulean blue, and titanium white, but he also used two new organic reds, Naphtol and Lithol. The Naphtol did well, but the Lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light. Within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue, and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{Rp|475-76}}

== Symbolism ==

=== Courage and sacrifice ===
Surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|43}} In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the [[First Crusade]] was a red cross on a white field, the [[St. George's Cross]].  According to Christian tradition, [[Saint George]] was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the [[Flag of England]] in the 16th century, and now is part of the [[Union Flag]] of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

In 1587, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accused of treason against Queen [[Elizabeth I]], wore a red shirt at her execution, to proclaim that she was an innocent martyr.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|32}}

[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|The Thin Red Line]] was a famous incident in the [[Battle of Balaclava]] (1854) during the [[Crimean War]], when a thin line of Scottish Highlander infantry, assisted by Royal Marines and Turkish infantrymen, repulsed a Russian cavalry charge. It was widely reported in the British press as an example of courage in the face of overwhelming odds and became a British military legend.

In the 19th-century novel ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]'' by [[Stephen Crane]], a story about the [[American Civil War]], the red badge was the blood from a wound, by which a soldier could prove his courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The poetry of Stephen Crane|last=Hoffman|first=Daniel|date=1971|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=0231086628|location=New York|pages=150|oclc=3153316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Courtly love, the red rose, and Saint Valentine's Day ===
Red is the color most commonly associated with love, followed at a great distance by pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques|last=Heller|first=Eva|date=1948|publisher=Pyramid|year=|isbn=9782350171562|location=Paris|pages=42|oclc=470802996|postscript=.

The [[Roman de la Rose]], the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/illmanus/other/028har000004425u00012v00.html|title=Description of the Roman de la Rose on the site of the British Library|last=de Lorris|first=Guillaume|date=Nov 30, 2003|website=|publisher=The British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=Sep 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific [[language of flowers]] – giving a single red rose meant 'I love you'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Forms of Meaning: Modeling Systems Theory and Semiotic Analysis|last=Sebeok|first=Thomas A.|last2=Danesi|first2=Marcel|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2000|isbn=9783110816143|location=Berlin|pages=150-52|oclc=868974205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Valentine]], a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD, seems to have had no known connection with romantic love, but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar, Saint Valentine's Day (February 14), became, in the 14th century, an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other. In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine' s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world. The celebration of Saint Valentine's Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran. In [[Saudi Arabia]], in 2002 and 2011, [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police]] banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, as the day is considered a Christian holiday.&lt;ref name="bbc 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1818642.stm|title=Cooling the ardour of Valentine's Day|last=|first=|date=Feb 3, 2002|work=BBC News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness, celebration and ceremony ===
Red is the color most commonly associated with joy and well being.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|46}} It is the color of celebration and ceremony. A [[red carpet]] is often used to welcome distinguished guests. Red is also the traditional color of seats in opera houses and theaters. Scarlet academic gowns are worn by new Doctors of Philosophy at degree ceremonies at Oxford University and other schools. In China, it is considered the color of good fortune and prosperity, and it is the color traditionally worn by brides.
In Christian countries, it is the color traditionally worn at [[Christmas]] by [[Santa Claus]], because in the 4th century the historic [[Saint Nicholas]] was the Greek Christian Bishop of [[Myra]], in modern-day Turkey, and bishops then dressed in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The world encyclopedia of Christmas|last=Bowler|first=Gerald|date=2004|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart Ltd|year=|isbn=9780771015359|location=Toronto|pages=|oclc=44154451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hatred, anger, aggression, passion, heat and war ===
{{expand section|1=more information about associating red with hatred, anger, aggression, passion, heat and war.|date=June 2015}}
While red is the color most associated with love, it also the color most frequently associated with hatred, anger, aggression and war. People who are angry are said to "{{wt|en|see red}}." Red is the color most commonly associated with passion and heat. In [[ancient Rome]], red was the color of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[god of war]]—the planet [[Mars]] was named for him because of its red color.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|42, 53}}

=== Warning and danger ===
Red is the traditional color of warning and danger. In the Middle Ages, a [[Red flag (signal)|red flag]] announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it, and a red flag hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In Britain, in the early days of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]] abolished this law.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In automobile races, the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red [[penalty card]] and ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/datdz0pms85gbnqy4j3k.pdf|title=Laws of The Game|first=|date=|website=fifa.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|pages=39, 72, 82–83|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311174803/https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/datdz0pms85gbnqy4j3k.pdf|archivedate=Mar 11, 2018|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Mar 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have indicated that red carries the strongest reaction of all the colors, with the level of reaction decreasing gradually with the colors orange, yellow, and white, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary ergonomics 1996|last=|first=|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=|isbn=0748405496|editor-last=Robertson|editor-first=S.

In fact, teachers at a primary school in the UK have been told not to mark children's work in red ink because it encourages a "negative approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2688623.stm|title=Red ink banned from primary books|last=|first=|date=Jan 23, 2003|work=BBC News World Edition|accessdate=Aug 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red is the international color of stop signs and stop lights on highways and intersections. It was standardized as the international color at the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] of 1968. It was chosen partly because red is the brightest color in daytime (next to orange), though it is less visible at twilight, when green is the most visible color. Red also stands out more clearly against a cool natural backdrop of blue sky, green trees or gray buildings. But it was mostly chosen as the color for stoplights and stop signs because of its universal association with danger and warning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|54}}

=== The color that attracts attention ===
[[File:Magdalena Frackowiak.jpg|150px|thumb|Fashion model [[Magdalena Frackowiak]] at [[Paris Fashion Week]] (Fall 2011)]]
Red is the color that most attracts attention. Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility, proximity, and extroverts.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|48, 58}}

Red is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention. People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors, even if they are actually the same distance away.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|48, 58}} Monarchs, wives of presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd. It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Because red attracts attention, it is frequently used in advertising, though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising, and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|60}}

=== Seduction, sexuality and sin ===
[[File:De Wallen.JPG|205x205px|thumb|alt=De Wallen neighborhood of Amsterdam|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[red-light district]]; red is the [[sex industry]]'s preferred color in many cultures, due to being strongly associated with passion, love and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|39-63}}]]
Red by a large margin is the color most commonly associated with seduction, sexuality, eroticism and immorality, possibly because of its close connection with passion and with danger.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|55}}

Red was long seen as having a dark side, particularly in [[Christian]] theology. It was associated with sexual passion, anger, sin, and the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theology of the Old Testament|last=Oehler|first=Gustav Friedrich|date=2015|publisher=Arkose Press|year=|isbn=9781345212341|editor-last=Day|editor-first=George E.|location=|pages=320|asin=1345212348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Isaiah]] said: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+1:18&amp;version=KJV|title=Isaiah 1:18 - King James Version|last=|first=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 26, 2018|quote=Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], in the [[Book of Revelation]], the Antichrist appears as a red monster, ridden by a woman dressed in scarlet, known as the [[Whore of Babylon]]:

"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
"And upon her forehead was a name written a mystery: ''Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and of all the abominations of the earth'':
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17&amp;version=KJV|title=Revelation 17 - King James Version|last=|first=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satan]] is often depicted as colored red and/or wearing a red costume in both iconography and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Symbols of the Christian faith|last=Steffler|first=Alva W.|date=2002|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub|year=|isbn=0802846769|location=Grand Rapids|pages=132|oclc=48557619}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, the devil in red had become a folk character in legends and stories. In 1915, Irving Berlin wrote a song, ''At the Devil's Ball'', and the devil in red appeared more often in cartoons and movies than in religious art.

In 17th-century New England, red was associated with [[adultery]]. In the 1850 novel by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[The Scarlet Letter]], set in a [[Puritan]] [[New England]] community, a woman is punished for adultery with ostracism, her sin represented by a red letter 'A' sewn onto her clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The scarlet letter|last=Hawthorne|first=Nathaniel|date=2004|publisher=Pocket|year=|isbn=0743487567|editor-last=Brantley|editor-first=Margaret|location=New York|pages=136|oclc=55483830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red is still commonly associated with [[prostitution]]. Prostitutes in many cities were required to wear red to announce their profession, and houses of prostitution displayed a red light. Beginning in the early 20th century, houses of prostitution were allowed only in certain specified neighborhoods, which became known as [[red-light districts]]. Large red-light districts are found today in [[Bangkok]] and [[Amsterdam]].

In [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], red represents wrath, one of the [[seven deadly sins]].

In both Christian and Hebrew tradition, red is also sometimes associated with murder or guilt, with "having blood on one's hands", or "being caught red-handed. {{cn|date=March 2018}}

== In different cultures and traditions ==
In China, red ({{zh|s=红|t=紅|p=hóng}}) is the symbol of [[fire (classical element)|fire]] and the south (both south in general and Southern China specifically). It carries a largely positive connotation, being associated with courage, loyalty, honor, success, fortune, fertility, happiness, passion, and summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hercity.com/enews/news/200708/0015_1242519177.html|title=中国红|last=Sujun|first=Li|date=|website=hercity.com|language=Chinese|trans-title=China Red|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215172541/http://www.hercity.com/enews/news/200708/0015_1242519177.html|archive-date=Dec 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global graphics: color|last=Peterson|first=Larry|date=2000|publisher=Rockport Publishers|year=|isbn=1564962938|editor-last=Cullen|editor-first=Cheryl D.|location=Gloucester|pages=147|oclc=45496750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese cultural traditions, red is associated with weddings (where brides traditionally wear red dresses) and red paper is frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects.

=== Wedding dresses ===
In many Asian countries, red is the traditional color for a [[wedding dress]] today, symbolizing joy and good fortune.
* In India, brides traditionally wear a red sari, called the sari of blood, offered by their father, signifying that his duties as a father are transferred to the new husband, and as a symbol of his wish for her to have children. Once married, the bride will wear a sari with a red border, changing it to a white sari if her husband dies. In Pakistan and India, some brides traditionally also have their hands and feet painted red with [[henna]] by the family of their new spouse, to bring happiness and signify their new status.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|95}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== In religion ==
* In Christianity, red is associated with the blood of Christ and the sacrifice of [[martyrs]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] it is also associated with [[pentecost]] and the Holy Spirit. Since 1295, it is the color worn by Cardinals, the senior clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. Red is the [[liturgical color]] for the feasts of martyrs, representing the blood of those who suffered death for their faith. It is sometimes used as the liturgical color for [[Holy Week]], including [[Palm Sunday]] and [[Good Friday]], although this is a modern (20th-century) development. In Catholic practice, it is also the liturgical color used to commemorate the Holy Spirit (for this reason it is worn at Pentecost and during Confirmation masses). Because of its association with martyrdom and the Spirit, it is also the color used to commemorate the Apostles (except for the Apostle St. John, who was not martyred, where white is used), and as such, it is used to commemorate bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles (for this reason, when funeral masses are held for bishops, cardinals, or popes, red is used instead of the white that would ordinarily be used).
* In [[Buddhism]], red is one of the five colors which are said to have emanated from the [[Buddha]] when he attained enlightenment, or [[nirvana]]. It is particularly associated with the benefits of the practice of Buddhism; achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune and dignity. It was also believed to have the power to resist evil. In China red was commonly used for the walls, pillars, and gates of temples.
* In the [[Shinto]] religion of Japan, the gateways of temples, called [[torii]], are traditionally painted vermilion red and black. The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place. The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red (and usually only temple bridges are red, not bridges in ordinary gardens), since they are also passages to sacred places.  Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease.

== Military uses ==

[[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems]] uses red to denote hostile forces, hence the terms "[[red team]]" and "[[Red Cell]]" to denote challengers during exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Korkolis |first1=M. |title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols |url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf |website=alternatewars.com |format=PDF |date=July 1986 |page=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The red uniform ===
The red military uniform was adopted by the English Parliament's [[New Model Army]] in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform by the British Army until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.  Ordinary soldiers wore red coats dyed with [[Rubia|madder]], while officers wore scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive [[cochineal]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|168-69}} This led to British soldiers being known as [[Red coat (British army)|red coats]].

In the modern British army, scarlet is still worn by the [[Foot Guards#British Army|Foot Guards]], the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]], and by some regimental bands or [[drum]]mers for ceremonial purposes. [[Commissioned Officer|Officers]] and [[Non-Commissioned Officer|NCOs]] of those regiments which previously wore red retain scarlet as the color of their "mess" or formal evening jackets. The [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] has a scarlet tunic in its winter dress.

Scarlet is worn for some full dress, military band or mess uniforms in the modern armies of a number of the countries that made up the former British Empire. These include the Australian, [[Jamaica]]n, New Zealand, [[Fiji]]an, Canadian, [[Kenya]]n, [[Ghanaian]], Indian, [[Singapore]]an, [[Sri Lanka]]n and Pakistani armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World uniforms in colour|last=d'Ami|first=Rinaldo|date=1968|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd|year=|isbn=0850590310|volume=Vol. 2: Nations of America, Africa, Asia and Oceania|location=London|pages=|oclc=14994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musicians of the [[United States Marine Corps Band]] wear red, following an 18th-century military tradition that the uniforms of band members are the reverse of the uniforms of the other soldiers in their unit. Since the US Marine uniform is blue with red facings, the band wears the reverse.

[[Red Serge]] is the uniform of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], created in 1873 as the [[North-West Mounted Police]], and given its present name in 1920. The uniform was adapted from the tunic of the [[British Army]]. Cadets at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] also wear red dress uniforms.

The [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] wears a red dress uniform.

== In sports ==
The first known team sport to feature red uniforms was [[chariot racing]] during the late [[Roman Empire]]. The earliest races were between two chariots, one driver wearing red, the other white. Later, the number of teams was increased to four, including drivers in light green and sky blue. Twenty-five races were run in a day, with a total of one hundred chariots participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|publisher=Harcourt|year=1960|isbn=0151355371|editor-last=Low|editor-first=M. D.|location=New York|pages=554|asin=0151355371|oclc=402038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today many sports teams throughout the world feature red on their uniforms. Along with [[blue]], red is the most commonly used non-white color in sports. Numerous national sports teams wear red, often through association with their national flags. A few of these teams feature the color as part of their nickname such as Spain (with their [[association football]] (soccer) national team nicknamed ''La Furia Roja'' or "The Red Fury") and Belgium (whose [[Belgium national football team|football team]] bears the nickname ''Rode Duivels'' or "Red Devils").

In club [[association football]] (soccer), red is a commonly used color throughout the world. A number of teams' nicknames feature the color. A red [[penalty card]] is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction: the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one less player for the game's duration.

In [[rugby union]], Ireland's [[Munster rugby]], New Zealand's [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] provincial team and the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] Super 14 rugby side wear red as a major color in their playing strips.

[[Rosso Corsa]] is the red international motor racing color of cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Maserati]], [[Lancia]], and later [[Ferrari]] and [[Abarth]] have been painted with a color known as ''rosso corsa'' ("racing red"). National colors were mostly replaced in [[Formula One]] by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the shade of the color varies.

The color is commonly used for professional sports teams in Canada and the United States with eleven [[Major League Baseball]] teams, eleven [[National Hockey League]] teams, seven [[National Football League]] teams and eleven [[National Basketball Association]] teams prominently featuring some shade of the color. The color is also featured in the league logos of Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3533300.ece|title=Teams with red shirts have a head start|last=Dart|first=Tom|date=Mar 12, 2008|work=Times Online|accessdate=Apr 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133533/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3533300.ece|archive-date=Jun 29, 2011|dead-url=yes|publisher=News International Group|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the National Football League, a red flag is thrown by the head coach to challenge a referee's decision during the game. During the 1950s when red was strongly associated with [[communism]] in the United States, the modern [[Cincinnati Reds]] team was known as the "Redlegs" and the term was used on baseball cards. After the red scare faded, the team was known as the "Reds" again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War|last=Cuordileone|first=Kyle A.|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=0415925991|location=New York|pages=13|oclc=56535047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[boxing]], red is often the color used on a fighter's gloves. [[George Foreman]] wore the same red trunks he used during his loss to [[Muhammad Ali]] when he defeated [[Michael Moorer]] 20 years later to regain the title he lost. Boxers named or nicknamed "red" include [[Red Burman]], [[Ernie Lopez|Ernie "Red" Lopez]], and his brother [[Danny Lopez (boxer)|Danny "Little Red" Lopez]].

== On flags ==
Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of [[blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the British Empire. The [[Union Flag|British flag]] bears the colors red, white and blue; it includes the [[cross (heraldry)|cross]] of [[Saint George]], patron saint of England, and the [[saltire]] of [[Saint Patrick's Flag|Saint Patrick]], patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracking the jack|last=Brabazon|first=Tara|date=2000|publisher=UNSW Press|year=|isbn=0868406996|location=Sydney|pages=|oclc=50382088}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|10}} The [[flag of the United States]] bears the colors of Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp|title=The United States Flag – Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Department of Veterans Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231081100/http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp|archivedate=Dec 31, 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=Dec 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the colors of the French [[Flag of France|tricolore]] include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]], [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], and [[Flag of Fiji|Fiji]], carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{Rp|13-20}} Many former colonies of Spain, such as [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Venezuela]], also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow. Red is prominently featured in the flag of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

The red on the [[flag of Nepal]] represents the [[floral emblem]] of the country, the [[rhododendron]].

Red, blue, and white are also the [[Pan-Slavic colors]] adopted by the Slavic solidarity movement of the late nineteenth century. Initially these were the colors of the Russian flag; as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples including [[Slovaks]], [[Slovenes]], and [[Serbs]]. The flags of the [[Flag of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] and [[Flag of Poland|Poland]] use red for historic heraldic reasons (see [[Coat of arms of Poland]] and [[Coat of arms of the Czech Republic]]) &amp; not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004 [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] adopted a new white [[flag of Georgia (country)|flag]], which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.

Red, white, and black were the colors of the [[German Empire]] from 1870 to 1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s they were adopted as the colors of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] flag. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention – Hitler wrote: "the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis, aimed at German workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm|title=The Life of the Führer|last=|first=|date=1938|website=German Propaganda Archive|publisher=Calvin.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=Sep 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mein Kampf|title-link=Mein Kampf|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|publisher=|year=1926|isbn=|volume=Vol. 2|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter VII|authorlink=Adolf Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red, gold, green, and black are the colors of [[Pan-Africanism]]. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including South Africa, [[Ghana]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Benin]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. The [[Pan-African colours|Pan-African colors]] are borrowed from the [[flag of Ethiopia]], one of the oldest independent African countries.&lt;ref name="flags" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanting Down Babylon|last=Murrell|first=Nathaniel S.|last2=Spencer|first2=William D.|last3=McFarlane|first3=Adrian A.|date=1998|publisher=Temple University Press|year=|isbn=1566395836|location=Philadelphia|pages=135|oclc=37115199|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rwanda, notably, removed red from [[Flag of Rwanda|its flag]] after the [[Rwandan Genocide]] because of red's association with blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/rw-ad01.html#var|title=Rwandan: Adoption of the new flag|last=|first=|date=Dec 31, 2005|website=Crwflags.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913164945/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/rw-ad01.html#var|archivedate=Sep 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=Dec 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flags of Japan and [[Bangladesh]] both have a red circle in the middle of different colored backgrounds. The flag of the [[Philippines]] has a red trapezoid on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red trapezoid is on top and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of [[Singapore]] has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the [[flag of Portugal]] is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] continuing the 1844 Ottoman [[Flag of Turkey|Flag]].

The red flag appeared as a political symbol during the [[French Revolution]], after the fall of [[Bastille]]. A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the [[Garde Nationale]] to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the [[Marseillaise]], [[Rouget de Lisle]] wrote: "Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!" (''Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve''). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Bernard Lacroix, « Troubles et criminalité de 1789 à l'an VI », ''La Révolution dans les Basses-Alpes'', Annales de Haute-Provence, bulletin de la société scientifique et littéraire des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, no. 307, 1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; trimestre 1989, 108&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; année, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Revolution, many in the Paris crowds also wore a red [[phrygian cap]], a symbol of liberty, modeled after the caps worn in ancient Rome by freed slaves; but the colors of the Revolution finally became blue, white and red. The red in the French flag was taken from the emblem of the city of Paris, where it represented the city's patron saint, [[Denis|Saint Denis]].

[[Karl Marx]] published the [[Communist Manifesto]] in February 1848, with little attention. However, a few days later the [[French Revolution of 1848]] broke out, which replaced the monarchy of [[Louis Philippe]] with the [[Second French Republic]]. In June 1848, Paris workers, disenchanted with the new government, built barricades and raised red flags. The new government called in the French Army to put down the uprising, the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker's movements in Europe.

Red was also the color of the movement to unify Italy, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. His followers were known as the ''camicie rosse'', or ([[redshirts (Italy)|redshirts]]) during the fight for Italian [[Risorgimento]] in 1860.

In 1870, following the stunning defeat of the French Army by the Germans in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the [[Paris Commune]]. The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army, with much bloodshed. The original red banners of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government with one of the original Commune banners; it was placed (and is still in place) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, next to his open coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft467nb2w4;query=;brand=ucpress|title=Bolshevik Festivals 1917–21|last=von Geldern|first=James|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the red flag, with a hammer to symbolize the workers and sickle to symbolize peasants, became the official flag of Russia, and, in 1923, of the Soviet Union. It remained so until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

After the Communist Party of China took power in 1949, the [[flag of China]] became a red flag with a large star symbolizing the Communist Party, and smaller stars symbolizing workers, peasants, the urban middle class and rural middle class. The flag of the Communist Party of China became a red banner with a [[hammer and sickle]], similar to that on the Soviet flag. In the 1950s and 1960s, other Communist regimes such as [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] also adopted red flags. Some Communist countries, such as Cuba, chose to keep their old flags; and other countries used red flags which had nothing to do with Communism or socialism; the red flag of [[Nepal]], for instance, represents the national flower.

In 18th-century Europe, red was usually associated with the monarchy and with those in power. The [[Pope]] wore red, as did the [[Swiss Guards]] of the [[Kings of France]], the soldiers of the [[British Army]] and the [[Danish Army]].

The [[French Revolution]] saw red used by the [[Jacobins]] as a symbol of the martyrs of the Revolution. In the nineteenth century, with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise of worker's movements, it became the color of [[socialism]] (especially the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Socialism (Marxism)|variant]]), and, with the [[Paris Commune]] of 1870, of revolution.

In the 20th century, red was the color first of the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] and then, after the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, of [[Communist Parties]] around the world.

Red also became the color of many [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties in Europe, including the Labour Party in Britain (founded 1900); the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (whose roots went back to 1863) and the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]], which dated back under different names, to 1879. The [[Socialist Party of America]] (1901–72) and the [[Communist Party USA]] (1919) both also chose red as their color.

Members of the [[Christian-Social People's Party (Liechtenstein)|Christian-Social People's Party]] in [[Liechtenstein]] (founded 1918) advocated an expansion of democracy and progressive social policies, and were often referred to disparagingly as "Reds" for their social liberal leanings and party colors.&lt;ref name="NA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Christlich-soziale Volkspartei |url=http://www.e-archiv.li/koerperschaftDetail.aspx?backurl=auto&amp;koerperID=3396 |website=e-archiv.li |publisher=Liechtenstein National Archives |accessdate=22 February 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of China]], founded in 1920, adopted the red flag and hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union, which became the national symbols when the Party took power in China in 1949. Under Party leader [[Mao Zedong]], the Party anthem became "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943793,00.html |title=The East Is Red |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]] |accessdate=2009-04-10 |date=1970-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mao Zedong himself was sometimes referred to as a "red sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morningsun.org/red/redfamily_cp_69.html |title=The Reddest Red Sun |publisher=[[Morning Sun (documentary)|Morning Sun]] |accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China, Party ideology was enforced by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], and the sayings of Mao Zedong were published as a small red book in hundreds of millions of copies.

Beginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, paramilitary extremist groups such as the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany, the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the [[Shining Path]] Maoist movement in [[Peru]] used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.

Red is used around the world by political parties of the left or center-left. In the United States, it is the color of the Communist Party USA, of the [[Social Democrats, USA]], and in Puerto Rico, of the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico]].

In the United States, political commentators often refer to the "red states", which traditionally vote for Republican candidates in presidential elections, and "blue states", which vote for the Democratic candidate. This convention is relatively recent: before the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], media outlets assigned red and blue to both parties, sometimes alternating the allocation for each election. Fixed usage was established during the 39-day recount following the 2000 election, when the media began to discuss the contest in terms of [[Red states and blue states|"red states" versus "blue states"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html|title=Elephants Are Red, Donkeys Are Blue|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=Nov 2, 2004|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=Apr 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819102044/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html|archive-date=Aug 19, 2018|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and special interest groups ==
Such names as Red Club (a bar), Red Carpet (a discothèque) or Red Cottbus and Club Red (event locations) suggest liveliness and excitement. The [[Red Hat Society]] is a social group founded in 1998 for women 50 and over. Use of the color red to call attention to an emergency situation is evident in the names of such organizations as the Red Cross (humanitarian aid), Red Hot Organization (AIDS support), and the Red List of Threatened Species (of [[IUCN]]). In reference to humans, term "red" is often used in the West to describe the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canadian Criminal Justice System|last=Larsen|first=Nick|date=1995|publisher=Canadian Scholars' Press|year=|isbn=155130046X|location=Toronto|pages=440|oclc=30666261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "to be in the red" (to be losing money, from the accounting habit of writing deficits and losses in red ink)
; Calling attention
* "a [[red letter day]]" (a special or important event, from the medieval custom of printing the dates of saints' days and holy days in red ink.)
* "to print in red ink" (for emphasis or easy identification)
* "to lay out the [[red carpet]]" or "give red-carpet treatment" (to treat someone royally as a very special person)
* "to catch someone red-handed" (in the act of doing something wrong, such with blood on his hands after a murder or poaching game)

; Other idioms
* "to tie up in [[red tape]]". In England red tape was used by lawyers and government officials to identify important documents. It became a term for excessive bureaucratic regulation. It was popularized in the 19th century by the writer [[Thomas Carlyle]], who complained about "red-tapism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_The%20Facts%20on%20File%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Word%20and%20Phrase%20Origins.pdf|title=The Facts on File encyclopedia of word and phrase origins|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=9780816069668|edition=4th|location=New York|pages=|asin=0816069662|oclc=166383622}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[red herring]]." A false clue that leads investigators off the track. Refers to the practice of using a fragrant smoked fish to distract hunting or tracking dogs from the track they are meant to follow.

== Superstition ==
* It is a common belief in the United States that red cars are stopped for speeding more often than other color cars. However, there is no statistical evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not the color of their cars. The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed that the number of speeding tickets given to drivers of red cars was about the same as the proportion of red cars on the road in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/red-handed/|title=Do Red Cars Get More Speeding Tickets?|last=Mikkelson|first=David|date=Jun 12, 2014|work=Snopes.com|access-date=Nov 26, 2018|quote=The survey showed that 16 percent of the cars seen on the road were red, and 18 percent of cars which received tickets in a year period were red.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In film ==
Many film titles have included the color's name, such as:
* [[The Woman in Red (1935 film)|''The Woman in Red'']], a 1935 American film
* [[Reds (film)|''Reds'']], a 1981 film about Communism in the United States and Russia
* [[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|''The Woman in Red'']], a 1984 American comedy film
* ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'', a 1991 Chinese film directed by [[Zhang Yimou]] about a concubine
* ''[[Three Colors: Red]]'', a French movie from 1994
* [[Red (2002 film)|''Red'']], a Tamil movie from 2002
* [[Red (2008 film)|''Red'']], a 2008 American film
* [[Red (2010 film)|''Red'']] and ''[[Red 2 (film)|Red 2]]'', American films from 2010 and 2013
* ''[[Red Dog (film)|Red Dog]]'', a 2011 Australian film
* ''[[Red State (2011 film)|Red State]]'', a 2011 American film
* ''[[Red Dawn]]'', 1984 and 2012 American films

The Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards is an independent award system, set up by Marco Rebora &lt;ref name="Marco Rebora"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rebora|first1=Marco|title=Marco Rebora|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 in the [[United Kingdom]] with the encouragement of a panel of judges, including the editor-in-chief of [[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper*]], Tony Chambers.

Since the first awards in 2009 there have been over 5,000 entries from [[design]] and [[architectural]] industries and [[hospitality]] organisations around the world.

Each year the awards are judged by a new panel of representatives from the fields of [[art]], [[architecture]], [[design]] and [[gastronomy]].  Notable judges have included [[Ian Callum]], [[Mark Hix]],&lt;ref name="Mark Hix"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hix|first1=Mark|title=Chicken and Steak|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/food/restaurant-and-bar-style-awards|website=Condé Nast Traveller|publisher=Condé Nast Traveller|accessdate=1 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Judah]], [[Yotam Ottolenghi]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Julia Peyton-Jones]] and [[Karim Rashid]]. The winners are awarded at annual ceremonies at a chosen host venue affiliated with the award. In 2012 the ceremony was held at The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).

Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards organises a year-round programme of events based in the UK and most recently Internationally with an aim to build a network between entrants, judges, partners and sponsors.
 
In 2014 [[Taschen]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiedemann|first1=Julius|title=Restaurant &amp; bar design|date=2014|publisher=TASCHEN|location=Köln|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; publications published a book, ''Restaurant &amp; Bar Design'' dedicated to the ongoing work of the Awards.

== Categories==
Each year the Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards acknowledges two overall winners under the categories of Best [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]] and Best [[Restaurant]].

The number of additional category winners varies each year. The inaugural award in 2008/2009 was open to entrants from UK and identified nine category winners. In 2009/10 the awards became International and introduced two more category winners under the titles International [[Restaurant]] and International [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]. The awards also have a number of sub-categories.

The '''Ringlemere Gold Cup''' is a [[Bronze Age]] vessel found in the [[Ringlemere barrow]] near [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] in the English county of [[Kent]] in [[2001 in archaeology|2001]].

==Description==
The body of the cup was created by hammering a single piece of gold, with the handle cut from a flat strip of gold and attached by rivets.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Although badly crushed by recent plough damage it can be seen to have been 14&amp;nbsp;cm high with corrugated sides. The cup resembles a late [[Neolithic]] (approximately 2300 BC) ceramic beaker with [[Corded Ware culture|Corded Ware]] decoration, but dates to a much later period.

It is thought that the cup was not a [[grave goods|grave good]], but a [[votive offering]] independent of any inhumation, which was placed at the centre of the barrow in about 1700–1500 BC. No contemporary burials have been found at the site, although later [[Iron Age]] ones have since been found, along with a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] cemetery.

Only seven similar gold "unstable handled cups" (unstable because round-bottomed) have been found in Europe, all dating to the period between 1700 and 1500 BC. The Ringlemere cup is most similar to the other British example, the [[Rillaton gold cup]] found in [[Cornwall]] in 1837.  The other examples are two from Germany, two from Switzerland, one now lost from [[Brittany]], and an unprovenanced, perhaps German, example.  Two other silver cups and, from Britain, two [[amber]] and some [[shale]] cups all share the same basic shapes (see [[Hove amber cup]]).  The finds in Britain are in the approximate [[Wessex]] area, and on the continent near the Rhine or the Channel coast, suggesting that the vessels, though probably all made fairly locally to their find spots, related to a specific cross-channel trading zone.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., Sections 8, "conclusion" and 9, "catalogue"&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was discovered by [[metal detector]]ist Cliff Bradshaw on 4 November 2001.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1344081&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=ringlemere+Cup&amp;bibliography=7772&amp;page=1 |title=Collection Online – The Ringlemere Cup |work=The British Museum |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4181475/Bronze-Age-gold-cup-uncovered-by-metal-detector.html |title=Bronze Age gold cup uncovered by metal detector|first= David|last=Derbyshire |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=5 April 2002 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported the find to the local [[coroner]]'s office, and through the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] and the [[Treasure Act 1996]] the cup was recorded and declared to be [[Treasure trove|treasure]] in 2002. It was bought by the [[British Museum]] for £270,000 (roughly US$520,000), with the money paid split between Bradshaw and the Smith family who own Ringlemere Farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3606481/If-it-whines-it-must-be-gold.html |title=If it whines it must be gold… |first= Elizabeth|last=Grice |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 November 2003 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money to secure the cup for the nation was raised through donations by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]] and [[The British Museum Friends]].&lt;ref name=BM /&gt;

After discovery of the cup, the site was excavated between 2002 and 2005 revealing a history starting with activity in the [[Mesolithic#Europe|Mesolithic]] period, a number of [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] features and finds, a funerary complex of Early Bronze Age date (approximately 2300 BC), and an Anglo-Saxon cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was number 10 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the [[British Museum]] for the [[2003 in television|2003]] [[BBC Television]] [[Documentary television series|documentary]] ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]'' which included an interview with Bradshaw.

From 14 May 2004 until 13 January 2006 the cup appeared in the Museum's "Buried Treasure" exhibition on [[treasure trove]], both at the Museum itself and touring (to the National Museum &amp; Gallery of Wales at Cardiff, Manchester Museum, the Hancock Museum at Newcastle, and the Norwich Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery).  On its return to London, it was on temporary display in Room 2 of the British Museum, with the Rillaton cup, until 17 October 2006.  From 17 October to 26 February 2007 it was on temporary display in [[Dover Museum]], closer to its find-spot, and it is now back in the Prehistory galleries at the British Museum.&lt;ref name=BM /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74253">'''Harmony Classic''' is a women's [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] competition for small and mid-sized choruses run by [[Sweet Adelines International]] as part of the organisation's annual convention since 2010. The results of the competition are as follows.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmony Classic|url=http://www.barbershophistory.com/scoresstats/harmony-classic/|website=Barbershop History|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoofiles&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmony Classic|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SweetAdelinesScores/files/Harmony%20Classic/|website=Sweet Adelines Scores (Yahoo Group)|accessdate=27 April 2015|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a full explanation of the scoring system, qualification process, awards and records, see [[Sweet Adelines International competition]].

[[File:Metro Nashville Chorus Houston 2011-1018.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Metro Nashville Chorus]] having just become the "Mid-Size Chorus" (Division AA) [[#Harmony Classic champions|Harmony Classic champions]] in Houston, 2011]]
Qualification for the competition happens as part of the regional chorus competition. The five highest-scoring small (division A, fewer than 30 singers) and midsize (division, AA 31–60 singers) choruses across all regional competitions qualify directly for the Harmony Classic of the following year. With five choruses in each of the two divisions (A &amp; AA) a total of 10 choruses compete in this competition each year. Only one chorus from a region may compete in each of the divisions and the previous year's winner may not compete in the same division again the following year. Furthermore, a chorus may not compete in both the main competition and also the Harmony Classic at the same year. A chorus may potentially qualify for both the main chorus competition as well as the Harmony Classic, but are only permitted to compete in one, thereby making a space available for the next highest qualifier to take their place at the other competition.{{sfn|Competition Handbook|2015|p = 11}}

'''Taper burn marks''' are deep flame shaped scorch marks often found on the timber beams of [[Early modern period|early modern]] houses.&lt;ref name="MedievalGraffiti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medieval-graffiti.co.uk/page101.html|title=Taper Burns|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=Norfolk Medieval Graffiti Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally thought to have been accidental, but research suggests that most marks may have been made deliberately, as there is clear patterning of the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Burn marks on buildings: accidental or deliberate?|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/0305547714Z.00000000021?journalCode=yvea20|last1=John|first1=Dean|last2=Hill|first2=Nick|journal=Vernacular Architecture|volume=45|issue=1|date=12 December 2014|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are theorised to have been made as part of a [[Folk religion|folk superstition]], then thought to protect the building from fire and lightning.&lt;ref name="MedievalGraffiti"/&gt;

They are often found around entrances to the home such as fireplaces, doors and windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beamcleanrestore.com/candle-burn-marks-deliberate-or-accidental/|title=Candle Burn Marks.

'''Tenga Rinpoche''' (1932–2012) was a [[Tibet]]an teacher ([[lama]]) in the [[Karma Kagyu]] tradition.&lt;ref name="benchen"&gt;[http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche.html Short Biography of the Tenga Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710011639/http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche.html |date=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Kham]] in 1932,&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; Tenga Rinpoche was recognized as a [[Tulku|reincarnation]] of Lama Samten&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"&gt;[http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/teachers/tea10.php Tenga Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601033101/http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/teachers/tea10.php |date=2013-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;

As he grew older, he studied at [[Benchen Monastery]]&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; and was eventually [[Dharma name|given the name]] Karma Tenzin Thinle Namgyal from [[Tai Situpa|Situ Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; Soon after, he was given ordination by Situ Rinpoche and entered a three-year retreat.&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

He was an expert in mandala painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tenga_Rinpoche Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Tenga Rinpoche left Benchen for [[Lhasa]]. After the [[14th Dalai Lama]] left Tibet in relation with the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], he escaped with [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and the brother of Dilgo Khyentse, the 9th [[Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="Tenga Brilliant Moon"&gt;Tenga Rinpoche, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0voLU0FgYy8C&amp;pg=PA193 Visions in Exile] p. 193-197, in ''Brilliant Moon: The Autobiography of Dilgo Khyentse''&lt;/ref&gt; He then eventually traveled to northern India.&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; In India, he settled at [[Rumtek Monastery]], the main seat of [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa Lama|the 16th Karmapa]].&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; Tenga Rinpoche served the 16th Karmapa for seventeen years,&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; nine of those years in the position of [[Dorje Lopön]].&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

In 1976 Tenga Rinpoche settled in [[Swayambhunath]], [[Nepal]], where he founded a second Benchen Monastery and a retreat center in [[Pharping]].&lt;ref name="Tenga Brilliant Moon" /&gt;

In 1986, Tenga Rinpoche established the new [[Benchen Monastery]] in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

He visited France regularly, giving teachings at [[Kagyu-Dzong]] in Paris and [[Vajradhara-Ling]] in Normandy. On September 21, 2003, he laid the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Temple for Peace]] in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727140515/http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf Dalaï Lama France 2008], see page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2012, at 3:24 in the morning Nepali time, Tenga Rinpoche died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche/news/231-the-passing-of-tenga-rinpoche.html The passing of Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyima Döndrup, the yangsi (reincarnation) of the previous Tenga Rinpoche was born December 14, 2014 in Nepal. He was discovered in 2017 following the indications of the [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje|17th Karmapa]] who met him on March 21, 2017 in [[Bodhgaya]] for a ceremony at Tergar Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kagyuoffice.org/an-amazing-story-finding-the-reincarnation-of-tenga-rinpoche/ An Amazing Story: Finding the Reincarnation of Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Drouth''''' is an American-format quarterly periodical published in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. It was founded in 2001 by Mitchell Miller and Johnny Rodger.

Although its title is [[Scots language|Scots]] (Eng: ''The Thirst'') the magazine is published mostly in [[Scottish Standard English]] though features and fiction do regularly appear in languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Broad Scots]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]].

''The Drouth'' is unusual for a Scottish literary magazine in that it only infrequently publishes poetry, arguing that as poetry covers a good portion of other magazines’ content, its efforts are better focused on other art-forms less well represented in Scotland's 'small mags'. The magazine works on a commissioning basis, and does not encourage unsolicited submissions. It has a particular focus on literature, film and politics but also covers [[visual art]], [[music]], [[architecture]], [[photography]] and [[comix]], as well as giving generous space to creative [[fiction]].

The magazine sponsors a number of cultural events, mostly in Glasgow. Every issue also features a guest editor (usually someone of distinction in a given field) and guest cover artist.

==Editorial stance==
The Drouth's editorial stance could be described as non-aligned left with occasional anarchistic and libertarian overtones as shown by its ties to radical online publications such as Pulse and Spinwatch, and with the author [[James Kelman]]. Nevertheless, it also publishes work by more establishment figures on the left and right of the political spectrum, and editorial board members such as [[Owen Dudley Edwards]] retain links to the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]]. The magazine is a frequent critic of the [[Scottish Labour Party]] but maintains it follows no party alignment and is uncommitted on the issue of Scottish independence.

In general, the magazine has taken an aggressively non-institutional stance and has found common cause with magazines such as [[Variant (magazine)|Variant]], though it retains an independent approach on political issues and does not maintain formal links with major organisations and institutions. Its editorial board is nevertheless, drawn from a mainly institutional background across the two major Scottish cities and currently consists of;

*David Archibald, Lecturer, Dept of Film Theatre and Television [[The University of Glasgow]] (2006–present)
*Gerard Carruthers, Head of Dept of Scottish Literature, The University of Glasgow (2001–present)
*Steve Davismoon, Composer and lecturer at [[Napier University]], Edinburgh (2003–present)
*Owen Dudley Edwards, Reader in History, The University of Edinburgh (2001–present)
*Dorian Grieve, Editor and Researcher in Linguistics, University of Glasgow (2004–present)
*Simon Kovesi, Head of English and Modern Languages, [[Oxford Brookes University]] (2009–present)
*Emily Munro, Head of Learning, [[Glasgow Film Theatre]] (2008–present)
*Ruaridh Nicoll, Journalist and novelist (2004–present)
*Miriam Ross, Researcher in film and related studies (also web editor) (2010)
*Elke Weissmann, Lecturer, [[Liverpool Edgehill University]]

Editorial board members primarily offer advice, but can also commission work, initiate ideas for issues and get involved in production. Several editorial board members were initially guest editors who joined the permanent staff.

'''''The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore''''' is a 2011 animated short film directed by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] and [[Brandon Oldenburg]], and produced by [[Moonbot Studios]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higa |first=Michelle |title=The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore |url=http://www.shortoftheweek.com/2012/01/24/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore |publisher=Short of the Week |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as an "allegory about the curative powers of story," the film centers on [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] Lessmore and his custodianship of a magical library of flying books. It was created using [[computer animation]], [[Scale model|miniatures]] and traditional hand-drawn techniques.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles&gt;{{cite news|last=Rome|first=Emily|title=Oscar shorts: 'Morris Lessmore' has hybrid animation, iPad app|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/01/oscars-short-films-fantastic-flying-books-morris-lessmore-animation.html|accessdate=March 17, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning over a dozen film festivals, the film was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. An official [[iPad]] app based on the film was also released in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]]. This however requires updating as it does not work with the current iOS. A book adaptation was released in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore" Nominated for Best Animated Short in 2011 Oscars |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore-nominated-for-best-animated-short-in-2011-oscars-2012-01-24 |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Morris Lessmore sits on a balcony in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]] writing a memoir. Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris's writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings.

After the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book's pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of [[Humpty Dumpty]], who urges Morris to follow him.

The flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris.

Morris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf.{{#tag:ref|The large book on which Morris sleeps is the same title; its inclusion may reference the studio's name "Moonbot". The library also includes Moon globes and in one scene the Moon is featured prominently in a window.|group="Note"}} He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library.

Years later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life's work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris's portrait added to the picture wall in the library.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Porkpie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buster Keaton]] wearing a [[pork pie hat]]]]
The book was inspired by William Morris, children's books publisher at [[HarperCollins]] and Joyce's mentor. Joyce wrote a story about a man who gives his life to books when he was on an airplane flight to visit Morris. Joyce read the story to Morris, who died a few days after that.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles /&gt;

Morris Lessmore was visually modeled after the silent film actor Buster Keaton. The film drew particular inspiration from the storm scene in Keaton's ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' and the tornado from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Also an inspiration was the real-life [[Hurricane Katrina]] which devastated New Orleans in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Like ''The Wizard of Oz'', the film utilizes the contrast of color and black-and-white as a narrative device. In this case, the black-and-white represents the sadness and despair brought about by the storm.

==Reception==
[[File:William Joyce Oscar Parade Shreveport Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|Writer and co-director [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] holding the Academy Award won by the film in 2012]]
The film has received 14 awards, including the Audience Award at the [[Austin Film Festival]], "Best Animated Short" at the [[Cinequest Film Festival]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].

Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] congratulated Shreveport-based animation studio Moonbot Studios for winning an Oscar at the 84th Annual Academy Awards in Hollywood. "Louisiana celebrates this Oscar win with the exceptionally talented and creative staff of Moonbot Studios in Shreveport," Jindal said. "We're proud that Louisiana residents and a Louisiana-based company created this groundbreaking work that pays homage to a love of books and perseverance through a love of learning.&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/louisiana-governor-salutes-moonbot-oscar-3268/ |title=Louisiana governor salutes Moonbot on Oscar |first=Paul|last=Anderson|publisher=Big Cartoon News |date=28 February 2012|accessdate=28 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hunt in the Forest''''' (also known as '''''The Hunt by Night''''' or simply '''''The Hunt''''') is a painting by the Italian artist [[Paolo Uccello]], made around 1470. It is perhaps the best-known painting in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]], England.

The painting is an early example of the effective use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[Renaissance]] art, with the hunt participants, including people, horses, dogs and deer, disappearing into the dark forest in the distance. It was Uccello's last known painting before his death in 1475.

== In popular culture ==
The painting is featured in the "Point of Vanishing" episode of the British TV series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]''. A postcard of the painting is discovered as a clue to a murder. Lewis and his colleague visit the painting at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] on more than one occasion and are instructed on its significant features by a museum expert. The painting provides Lewis with an insight that allows him to solve the case.

[[John Fowles]] mentions the painting twice, in ''[[The Ebony Tower]]'' and ''[[The Collector]]'': "...the design hits you the moment you see it.  Apart from all the other technical things.  You know it's faultless."

'''The Thing''' is an international net-community of artists and art-related projects that was started in 1991 by [[Wolfgang Staehle]]. The Thing was launched as a mailbox system accessible over the telephone network in New York feeding a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) in 1991 before their website was launched in 1995 on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], ''Art and Electronic Media''. London: Phaidon, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, The Thing grew into a diverse online community made up of dozens of members' Web sites, mailing lists, a successful Web hosting service, a community studio in Chelsea (NYC), and the first Web site devoted to [[Net Art]]: bbs.thing.net.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== The Thing BBS (1991)===
In 1991, The Thing began as a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) focusing on contemporary art and cultural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Daniels, Gunther Reisinger (Eds.) “Net Pioneers 1.0: Contextualizing Early Net-Based Art”, Sternberg. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the writer and critic Blackhawk (having recently produced the film ''[[Cyberpunk]]'') taught Wolfgang Staehle many of the abilities he needed to start the original The Thing BBS. Blackhawk was the first person Staehle turned to after conceiving the idea for an electronic culture resource based on the model of [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[Social sculpture]]''. Blackhawk and Wolfgang jointly set up the editorial structure of the original BBS and planned for many of the then experimental activities that took place. Other people who helped develop and shape the content of the early BBS included [[Josefina Ayerza]], [[Dike Blair]], Donald Newman, the original programmer, Jordan Crandall, David Platzker, Josh Decter, [[Rainer Ganahl]], [[Julia Scher]], [[Barry Schwabsky]], Morgan Garwood, Franz von Stauffenberg and Benjamin Weil.

A second node, The Thing Cologne, was added in 1992, followed by The Thing Vienna in November 1993. Nodes in Berlin and elsewhere were soon to follow.

===The Thing on the Web (1995)===
The Thing changed its form when a website was created for a presentation at the 1995 [[Ars Electronica]]. Credits on the 1995 website also name Nicky Chaikin, [[John F. Simon Jr.]], [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Rob Keenan, Darryl Erentzen and John Rabasa.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.thing.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 The Thing set up an independent art network with hardware of its own that offered arts communities ways to establish themselves, to send information to one another and also to conceive of new artistic practices deriving from [[conceptual art]] and from [[performance art]]. The idea was that working with the Internet was a way to operate around the institutions of art distribution of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Max Kossatz designed ''The Thing Communicator'' a website mimicking many functions of the original BBS including member login, chat and messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The most [[interactive]] area of The Thing consisted of various message boards offering forums for [[art theory]] debate, news and gossip, ongoing dialogue and an open-access flow of information as well as several online versions of art journals.

Alongside discussion forums The Thing has offered artworks in the form of [[graphics]] downloadable to the home [[personal computer]] – for example by [[Peter Halley]].

===thing.net communities===
The Thing has enabled a diverse group of artists, critics, curators, and activists to use the internet in its early stages. At its core, The Thing is a [[social network]], made up of individuals from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of expert knowledge. From this social hub, The Thing has built an array of programs and initiatives, in both technological and cultural networks. During its first five years, TT became widely recognized as one of the founding and leading online centers for [[new media]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include hosting artists' projects and mailing lists - as well as publishing cultural criticism.

The Thing has also organized many public events and symposia on such topics as the state of [[new media]] arts, the preservation of online privacy, artistic innovations in [[robotics]], and the possibilities of community empowerment through wireless technologies.

In 1997, thing.net communications, LLC, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) was incorporated by Wolfgang Staehle, Gisela Ehrenfried and Max Kossatz.  The ISP was to provide a financial backbone for The Thing Inc. (a 501 c 3 non profit organization).  thing.net has hosted arts and activist groups and publications including [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]], [[Artforum]], [[Mabou Mines]], [[Willoughby Sharp]] Gallery, [[Zingmagazine]],  Journal of Contemporary Art, [[RTMark]] and Tenant.net.

Among many others, artists and projects associated with thing.net have included Sawad Brooks, [[Heath Bunting]], Cercle Ramo Nash, [[Vuk Cosic]], [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], [[Ursula Endlicher]], [[etoy]], [[GH Hovagimyan]], Jérôme Joy, [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], Jenny Marketou, [[Mariko Mori]], [[Olivier Mosset]], Prema Murty, [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Phil Niblock]], Daniel Pflumm, [[Francesca da Rimini]], [[Beat Streuli]] and Beth Stryker.

[[File:The Tilled Field.jpg|300px|thumb]]

'''''The Tilled Field''''' (French: ''La terre labourée''; Catalan: ''Terra llaurada'') is a 1923-4 oil-on-canvas painting by Catalan painter [[Joan Miró]], depicting a stylised view of his family's farm at [[Mont-roig del Camp]] in [[Catalonia]].  The painting shows development from Miró's earlier works, such as ''[[The Farm (Miró)|The Farm]]'', and is considered to be one of his first [[Surrealist]] works, created around the same time as the more abstracted ''[[Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)]]''.

The painting measures {{convert|66|x|92.7|cm}}.  It is dominated by muted tones of yellow and brown.  The image is divided into three areas by two horizontal lines, perhaps representing the sky, sea and earth; a diagonal line seems to put the top right corner of the painting in the dark of night, while the rest is in the light of day.  The painting is littered with a confused mixture of forms, many with aspects of humans, animals, and plants. The various animal forms are derived from Catalan ceramics, including a lizard wearing a conical hat.  A tree to the right of centre has a large eye in its green crown and a human ear on its brown trunk.  Hanging from the tree is a shape covered with more eyes, possibly a [[pinecone]], or perhaps a leaf or a spider; at the base of the tree is a folded newspaper with the French word ''jour'' (day).  Further right, in the background, is a human figure following a cattle-drawn plough, based on the [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira cave]] paintings.  Also in the background, towards the centre, is a ramshackle house with chimney, and further left a tree-like object bearing the flags of France, Spain and Catalonia.  Another plant-like object to the left bears a further flag, possibly French, perhaps symbolising the border between France (left) and Spain (right)

It is held by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York.

{{Cleanup|date=February 2010}}
'''''The Transporters''''' is an animation series produced by Catalyst Pictures Ltd designed to help children with [[autism]] aged between two and eight years old recognise and understand emotions. 

It was developed by the Autism Research Centre at the [[University of Cambridge]] by a team led by Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] and including Dr Ofer Golan. 

''The Transporters'' is based on the idea that children with autism may find faces confusing because they are unpredictable, because the autistic brain cannot cope with unpredictability. In Baron-Cohen's theory, children with autism are strong 'systemizers' and faces are hard to systemize. In contrast, children with autism have a preference for predictable systems. The Transporters therefore focuses on mechanical vehicles that only travel along tracks, because they are highly predictable systems. Grafted onto these animated vehicles are human faces. In this way, social skills teaching takes place in an [[autism friendly]] format.

== Evaluation ==

A study &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/y4164n56855305p0/?p=86f98a5391de4cd185ed81fa3b570b6a&amp;pi=12 Enhancing Emotion Recognition in Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions: An Intervention Using Animated Vehicles with Real Emotional Faces]&lt;/ref&gt; published in the ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'' found that after watching the DVD for 15 minutes a day for four weeks most children with ASC (autistic spectrum condition) caught up with typically developing children in their ability to recognise emotions on four different tasks.

== The series ==

''The Transporters'' DVD consists of 15 five-minute episodes, each featuring a key emotion. There are also 30 interactive quizzes and an accompanying booklet to reinforce learning.  In 2007, the series was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award. 

The series features eight animated toy vehicles. Each has an actual human face so that viewers learn to recognise real rather than cartoon expressions.  All the expressions were verified by an independent panel before they were included in the series. 

There are two versions of the DVD, with different accents and vocabulary. The North American version is voiced by [[Kerry Shale]] and the British English version is voiced by [[Stephen Fry]]. 

''The Transporters'' was originally commissioned by Culture Online, which was part of the UK government’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

[[File:Bringing up baby film still.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Film still]] from the 1938 film ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]''  featuring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Cary Grant]]  ]]
A '''unit still photographer''', or simply '''still photographer''', is a person who creates [[film still]]s, still [[Photography|photographic]] images specifically intended for use in the marketing and publicity of feature [[film]]s in the motion picture industry and network [[television]] productions.&lt;ref name="Dzyak2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Dzyak|title=What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood: A Guide to Real Jobs in the Film Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY6Ej4fO1QC&amp;pg=PA303|year= 2010|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-87516-7|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Goldman|title=The professional photographer: developing a successful career|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7k4YAQAAMAAJ|page=117|year= 1983|publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerrigan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Finola Kerrigan|title=Film Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbWKtM-L-ugC&amp;pg=PT243|year= 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-44000-7|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides creating photographs for the promotion of a film, the still photographer contributes daily to the filming process by creating set stills. With these, the photographer is careful to record all details of cast wardrobe, set appearance and background.  The director and assistants review these images frequently for continuity and matching of all stage aspects.&lt;ref&gt;"Still Photography in the Motion Picture Industry" by Ned Scott&gt;: http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/authorship.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornel Lucas]], a pioneer of film portraiture in the 1940s and 1950s, was the first still photographer to be awarded a [[BAFTA]], in 1998, for work with the [[British Film Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cornel Lucas: Photographer who made his name as a pioneer of film portraiture - Obituaries |newspaper=The Independent| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cornel-lucas-photographer-who-made-his-name-as-a-pioneer-of-film-portraiture-8399597.html|author=Martin Childs|date=11 December 2012| accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DawsonHolmes2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Dawson|author2=Sean Holmes|title=Working in the Global Film and Television Industries: Creativity, Systems, Space, Patronage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yixuaRMJ6tIC&amp;pg=PT136|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78093-021-3|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in the industry ==
Using individual [[Film frame|frames]] from film or recorded video material is not practical due to their relatively low quality. Much higher resolution images are therefore used. Typically, the end uses of these still photos include the film's theatrical release poster, [[DVD]] box artwork, the official web site photos, [[billboard]]s, [[bus stop]] adverts, [[Point of sale|point-of-purchase]] displays, key art image sets released to the press and media, and other printed and online collateral materials.

Unit still photographers are also responsible for creating "photo [[Theatrical property|props]]" and "set dressing images", the photos and images used on-camera to create various [[illusion]]s such as [[Forensic science|forensic photos]], crime drama booking photos, character driver's licenses, [[passport]] and I.D. photos, on-screen family photos, surveillance photos, computer screen displays, and any other image a producer may require in the course of a production.

In [[North America]] in particular, and some international locations, a unit still photographer must be a member of [[International Cinematographers Guild|IATSE Local 600 International Cinematographers Guild]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} in order to perform services on union productions and union studio lots and locations.  The most prestigious of these unit still photographers are members of The Society of Motion Picture Still Photographers, an organization which promotes the work of those within the industry.

While often perceived as a "glamour" job for photographers, the reality is often long hours (70-plus hours per week) on remote locations under difficult and often extreme conditions.  The unit still photographer often coordinates with the unit publicist, but physically works in close proximity to the film's [[Film crew|camera crew]], [[Film director|director]] and [[actor]]s, and also in close proximity to the film's boom microphone operator. Unit still photographers go to great lengths to muffle the sound of their camera's [[motor drive]] and [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] to avoid distracting the actors, and to remain inaudible on the film's recorded dialogue soundtrack.

Typically, this is accomplished using a [[sound blimp]], which is a sound-absorbing, foam-filled metal case in which the still camera body is fitted with a proprietary remote operation cable. This allows the camera to be activated and operated from a two-button (activation, focus and shutter release) exterior control. Limitations exist once the blimp is closed around the camera, as one can no longer access the cameras controls ([[f-number]], shutter speed, ASA/[[Film speed|ISO]] settings) or menu displays directly. The [[Liquid crystal display|LCD display]] for reviewing the images will also be obscured in the closed position.  This requires the photographer to make control selections in advance, and use with those settings until the take in progress has been "cut", making adjustments only between takes or set-ups. Unit still photographers in this field typically produce over 2000 marketable images per week for their major-studio clients. Still photography involves the use of alignment, positioning, and other techniques to capture the "money shot". Still-life photography is the depiction of inanimate subject matter, most typically a small grouping of objects that are either human-made or natural.

Since 2010, high-end [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR cameras]], which can be remotely controlled with [[mobile apps]] on [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, using the built-in 2-way [[Wi-Fi]] radio-controlled interface between the tablet and the DSLR camera, and offer internal [[active noise control|''active noise reduction'']] technologies, have increased the ability of the unit still photographer to work quietly on the set.

{{Art and video games}}
The concept of '''video games as a form of art''' is a controversial topic within the [[entertainment industry]]. Though [[video game]]s have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the philosophical proposition that video games are works of [[art]] remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even [[art game]]s, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Art World for Artgames| author=Felan Parker| url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/view/119| journal=Loading...| volume=7| issue=11| pages= 54–55| year=2013| publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]| issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated [[History of video games (first-generation systems)|first]] and [[History of video games (second generation)|second generation]] games. In exhibitions such as the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]]'s 1989 "Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade", video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art.&lt;ref name=stalker&gt;Stalker, Phillipa Jane. ''[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/1749 Gaming In Art: A Case Study Of Two Examples Of The Artistic Appropriation Of Computer Games And The Mapping Of Historical Trajectories Of 'Art Games' Versus Mainstream Computer Games]''. [[University of the Witwatersrand]], Johannesburg. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Further explorations of this theme were set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s with exhibitions like the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Beyond Interface" (1998),&lt;ref name=holmes2002&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://www.crudeoils.us/artwrite/August2002/Holmes.htm Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade]''. Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference (Tampere, Finland); Art Gallery, [[SIGGRAPH|Siggraph 2002]]. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the online "Cracking the Maze - Game Plug-Ins as Hacker Art" (1999),&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;Pratt, Charles J. ''[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27133/The_Art_History_Of_Games_Games_As_Art_May_Be_A_Lost_Cause.php The Art History... Of Games? Games As Art May Be A Lost Cause]''. [[Gamasutra]]. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] Beall Centre's "Shift-Ctrl" (2000),&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; and a number of shows in 2001.&lt;ref name=holmes2002/&gt;

The concept of the video game as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]-style [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] or as [[found object]] resonated with early developers of the [[art game]]. In her 2003 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] paper, "Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre", professor Tiffany Holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the [[digital art]] community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and ''[[Burgertime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420092835/http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/papers/Holmes.pdf |date=April 20, 2013 }}''. [[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC 2003]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In modifying the code of simplistic early games or by creating [[art mod]]s for more complex games like ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the art game genre emerged from the intersection of commercial games and contemporary digital art.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, professor [[Celia Pearce]] further noted that alongside Duchamp's art productions, the [[Fluxus]] movement of the 1960s, and most immediately the [[New Games|New Games Movement]] had paved the way for more modern "art games". Works such as Lantz' ''[[Pac-Manhattan|Pac Manhattan]]'', according to Pearce, have become something like performance art pieces.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Most recently, a strong overlap has developed between art games and [[indie game]]s. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement is important according to Professor Pearce, insofar as it brings art games to more eyes and allows for greater potential to explore in indie games.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In March 2006, the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] first characterized video games as cultural goods and as "a form of artistic expression," granting the industry a tax subsidy&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema]''. [[New York Times]]. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and inducting two French game designers ([[Michel Ancel]], [[Frédérick Raynal]]) and one Japanese game designer ([[Shigeru Miyamoto]]) into the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. In May 2011, the United States [[National Endowment for the Arts]], in accepting grants for art projects for 2012, expanded the allowable projects to include "interactive games", furthering the recognition of video games as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that video games were protected speech like other forms of art in the June 2011 decision for ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]''. In Germany, prior to August 2018, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) software ratings body enforced [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' (German code) section 86a]] as outlined by the German government, which banned the sale of games that contained imagery of extremist groups such as Nazis; while Section 86a allowed for use of these images in artistic and scientific works, video games were not seen to fall within an artistic use. On August 9, 2018, the German government agreed to recognize some of the artistic nature of video games and softened the restriction on Section 86a, allowing the USK to consider games with such imagery as long as they fell within the social adequacy clause of Section 86a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-09-germany-relaxes-stance-on-nazi-symbols-in-video-games | title= Germany relaxes stance on Nazi symbols in video games | first = Matthew | last = Handrahan | date = August 9, 2018 | accessdate = August 9, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/german-ratings-board-starts-allowing-nazi-symbols-in-video-games/ | title = Germany says games with Nazi symbols can get “artistic” exception to ban | first=  Kyle | last= Orland | date = August 10, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dd44ce45-d5cf-4189-a1b6-7bcc7e31605f | title = German Attorney General: Video game with Swastika does not violate the law; constitutes art | first=  Baker | last=McKinsey | date = May 8, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Lexology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both [[game]] and [[interactive art]]. The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] held an exhibit in 2012, entitled "[[The Art of Video Games]]", which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games, including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture.&lt;ref name="smithsonian exhibit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | title = Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games | publisher = [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] | accessdate = 2011-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806051435/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | archive-date = 2011-08-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian later added ''Flower'' and ''[[Halo 2600]]'', games from this collection, as permanent exhibits within the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/17/5222078/smithsonian-acquires-flower-halo-2600-for-its-permanent-collection | title = Smithsonian acquires Flower, Halo 2600 for its permanent collection | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = 2013-12-17 | accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|aims to collect]] forty historically important video games in their original format to exhibit, showcasing video game interaction design as part of a broader effort to "celebrate gaming as an artistic medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/11/moma-videogames/ | title = MoMA to Exhibit Videogames, From Pong to Minecraft | first = Olivia | last = Solon | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date  = 2012-11-29 | accessdate = 2012-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual "[[Into the Pixel]]" art exhibit held at the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] highlights [[video game art]] selected by a panel of both video game and art industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/arts/video-games/pixels-floating-on-the-art-worlds-margins.html | title = Pixels Floating on the Art World’s Margins | first = Harold | last=  Goldberg | date = 2013-06-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-15 | work = [[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empathy games===
{{anchor|Empathy game}}
While many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling, another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player, generally by having the user role-play as a character under a stress-inducing situation, covering topics associated with poverty, sexuality, and physical and mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/9/4313246/gamings-new-frontier-cancer-depression-suicide | title = Gaming's New Frontier: Cancer, Depression, Suicide | first = Colin | last =Campbell | date = May 9, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324769704579010641205335768 | title = Videogames About Alcoholism, Depression and Cancer | first = Conon | last = Dougherty | date = August 15, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such games are considered to be examples of an empathy game, loosely described by Patrick Begley of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' as a game that "asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/empathy-gaming-focuses-on-emotions-and-moral-decisions-20140904-10ch4z.html | title = 'Empathy gaming' focuses on emotions and moral decisions | first = Patrick | last = Begley | date = November 1, 2014 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The characterization of games as works of art has been controversial. While recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.

===Legal status===
American courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] as under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], in March 1982 in the case of ''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.''&lt;ref&gt;''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.'', 536 F.Supp. 170, D.C.N.Y., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In a brace of similarly decided lawsuits in 1982 and 1983, [[precedent]] began to be established for finding that video games were no more expressive than pinball, chess, board- or card-games, or organized sports. This began to change in 2000 as some courts began to make rulings in distinction and carving out narrow exceptions for some ''elements'' of video games.&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Kendrick'', 115 F.Supp.2d 943 (S.D.Ind.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2002, controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as Judge [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr.]], upon reviewing gameplay from "'[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|The Resident of Evil Creek]]'{{sic}}, '[[Mortal Combat]]'{{sic}}, '[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]],' and '[[Fear Effect]]'" ruled in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'' that "just like [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], the Court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Ass'n v. St. Louis County, Mo.'', 200 F.Supp.2d 1126, E.D.Mo.,2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, James. "[http://www.salon.com/2002/05/06/games_as_speech/ Playing games with free speech]". ''Salon''. 6 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011's ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' the United States Supreme Court ruled that games are entitled to First Amendment protection, with the majority opinion reading, "Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/06/27/supreme.court.video.game.art/|work=CNN|last=Sutter|first=John D.|title=Supreme Court sees video games as art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of legitimation===
Emerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation, even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Games have faced suspicion from critics of established media, just as film, television, and comics were once doubted.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Keith Stewart, games editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'', sees mainstream media as preferring to approach games from the angle of the human stories surrounding them – making indie games with identifiable creators attractive to journalists.&lt;ref name="bizStewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-03-13-the-first-guardian-keith-stuart-on-getting-games-into-culture|work=gamesindustry.biz|last=Pearson|first=Dan|title=The First Guardian: Keith Stuart on getting games into Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical communities devoted to games have likewise embraced [[auteur theory]] of games' artistic potential as underpinned by the creative visions of sole creators.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; John Lanchester of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' noted that even as video games become a larger market by revenues compared to films and books, the amount of attention given to video games is generally delegated to a limited set of sources and do not readily enter the "cultural discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art  |journal= [[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18–20 |doi= |access-date= October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet, with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games, when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game.&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-games-matter-indie-movie-fez-meat-427544|work=International Business Times|last=Smith|first=Edward|title=Indie Games Aren't Art Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than defending the medium as a whole, proponents of [[art game]]s attempt to create a separate milieu opposed to video games they accept to be [[low culture]].&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; In practice, indie auteurs often receive commercial backing, while mainstream creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Peter Molyneux are increasingly viewed as auteurs as well.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The conflation of indieness and artistry has been criticized by some, including [[Anna Anthropy]],&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; [[Lucy Kellaway]],&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; and [[Jim Munroe]],&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"/&gt; who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic.

Munroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and non-artistic, but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of non-artistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions. He further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture, in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms, than to a non-interactive presentation as in cinema.&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan. ''[http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/10/repeat-of-spark-126-october-16-19-2011 Repeat of Spark 126 – October 16 &amp; 19, 2011: Games as Art]'' (Podcast available: [http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 Games as Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074320/http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 |date=October 29, 2014 }}). ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game designer [[Kim Swift]] believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value. She feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/kim-swift-interview/|work=WIRED|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Portal Designer Kim Swift Won't Let You Take Her Toys Away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Ebert on video games as art===
The question rose to wide public attention in the mid-2000s when film critic [[Roger Ebert]] participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies. In 2005, following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was essential to a proper appreciation of the film ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (which Ebert had awarded one star) as a commentary on the game,&lt;ref name=moriarty&gt;Moriarty, Brian; Caoili, Eric (ed.). ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/03/opinion_brian_moriartys_apolog.php Opinion: Brian Moriarty's Apology For Roger Ebert]''. [[GameSetWatch]]. 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert described video games as a non-artistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms:

{{quote|text=To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders | title = Why did the chicken cross the genders? | date = 2005-11-27 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006, Ebert took part in a panel discussion at the [[Conference on World Affairs]] entitled "An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form?" in which he stated that video games don't explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url  = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/SCANNERS/60418001 | title = Video games: The 'epic debate' | first  =Jim | last =Emerson | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | title = An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form? | conference = 62nd Annual Conference on World Affairs | conferenceurl = http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/search_results.html?date=7&amp;year=2006 | date = 2006-04-13 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in response to comments from [[Clive Barker]] on the panel discussion, Ebert further noted that video games present a malleability that would otherwise ruin other forms of art. As an example, Ebert posed the idea of a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' that would allow for an optional happy ending. Such an option, according to Ebert, would weaken the artistic expression of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/COMMENTARY/70721001 | title=  Games vs. Art: Ebert vs. Barker  | date = 2007-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2010, Ebert published an essay, dissecting a presentation made by [[Kellee Santiago]] of [[thatgamecompany]] at the 2009 [[TED (conference)|Technology Entertainment Design Conference]], where he again claimed that games can never be art, due to their rules and goal-based interactivity.&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | title = Video games can never be art | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert | date = 2010-04-16 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111010001841/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | archive-date = 2011-10-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a [''[[sic]]''] immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"/&gt;}}

Ebert's essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1621426/game-designer-kellee-santiago-responds-to-roger-eberts-video-games-are-not-art-rant | title= Game Designer Kellee Santiago Responds to Roger Ebert's "Video Games Are Not Art" Rant  | first = Dan | last = Nosowitz | date = 2010-04-20 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/04/alt-text-videogames-as-art/ | title = Alt Text: Are Videogames Art?

Moving On… [My Response to Ebert] | first = Kellee | last = Santiago | date =2010-04-19 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | publisher = [[thatgamecompany]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later amended his comments in 2010, conceding that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense, that he had enjoyed playing ''[[Cosmology of Kyoto]]'', and addressing some replies to his original arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |title=Okay, kids, play on my lawn |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-31 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003526/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy, the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered [[fine art]] due to their commercial appeal and structure as choice-driven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary [[Brian Moriarty]] who in March 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled ''An [[Apologetics|Apology]] For Roger Ebert''.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; In this lecture Moriarty emphasized that video games are merely an extension of traditional rule-based games and that there has been no call to declare games like [[Chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] to be art. He went on to argue that art in the sense that [[Romanticism|Romantics]] like Ebert, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and he were concerned with (i.e. fine art or sublime art) is exceptionally rare and that Ebert was being consistent by declaring video games to be without artistic merit inasmuch as Ebert had previously claimed that "Hardly any movies are art."&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; Moriarty decried the modern expansion of the definition of "art" to include [[low art]], comparing video games to [[kitsch]] and describing aesthetic appreciation of video games as [[Camp (style)|camp]]. After addressing the corrupting influence of commercial forces in [[indie games]] and the difficulty of setting out to create art given the "slippery" tools that game designers must work with, Moriarty concluded that ultimately it was the fact that player choices were presented in games that structurally invalidated the application of the term "art" to video games as the audience's interaction with the work wrests control from the author and thereby negates the expression of art.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; This lecture was in turn criticized sharply by noted video game designer, [[Zach Gage]].&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt;

===Other notable critics===
In a 2006 interview with ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine|US Official PlayStation 2 Magazine]]'', game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] agreed with Ebert's assessment that video games are not art. Kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork, but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art. Since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100% player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person, Kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ellie. ''[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news240106kojimaart Games aren't art, says Kojima]''. Eurogamer. 24 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference, Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey (founding members of indie studio [[Tale of Tales (developer)|Tale of Tales]]), argued in no uncertain terms that games "are not art" and that they are by and large "a waste of time." Central to Tale of Tales' distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art: Whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by [[Play (activity)|play]], argues Samyn, and as play has manifested itself in the form of [[game]]s, games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity. Art, on the other hand, is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes. Thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient, according to Samyn, to disqualify it as art.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Gamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior third-party characterizations of Tale of Tales' productions as "art games," however Tale of Tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games. The characterization of their games as "art games," noted Samyn, was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry. While Tale of Tales acknowledged that old media featuring one-way communication was not enough, and that two-way communication via computers offers the way forward for art, the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; To enable and foment this futuristic two-way art, suggests Tale of Tales, the concept of "the game" must be eviscerated by games that do not fit within the current paradigm and then "life must be breathed into the carcass" through the creation of artworks Samyn and Harvey refer to as "not games."&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In 2011, Samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rule-based. Samyn identified an industry emphasis on [[gameplay mechanics]] as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport. Pointing to systemic problems, Samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient [[Video game development|development team]] who may not share the artist's vision. However, Samyn does not reject the idea that games, as a medium, can be used to create art. To create art using the medium of the video game Samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics, the development of "[[fun]]ness" or economic considerations must cease to guide the work's creation, and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artist-author's vision gains central primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Samyn, Michael. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_291/8608-Almost-Art Almost Art]''. [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]. 1 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art. Jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs "one person’s reaction to life" and that "no one owns the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|title=Sorry MoMA, video games are not art|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=2012-11-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, video game journalist Patricia Hernandez described a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] in the [[interactive fiction]] game ''[[Photopia]]''. The solution of the puzzle involves a [[Reveal (narrative)|reveal]] regarding the player's controlled [[Player character|playable character]], prompting experiences which Hernandez argues could not be made "as powerful as they are" in any other art form without interactivity. Hernandez says that narrations in the interactive medium happen in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and the [[present tense]], which are "fundamental (and often misunderstood) elements of the interactive medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2013/01/19/a-moment-of-perfect-beauty/|title=A Moment of Perfect Beauty|date=2013-01-19|work=Nightmare Mode [Archived]|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Waterfall''''' ({{lang-nl|Waterval}}) is a [[lithograph]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in October 1961. It shows a [[perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] where water from the base of a [[waterfall]] appears to run downhill along the water path before reaching the top of the waterfall.

While most two-dimensional artists use relative proportions to create an illusion of depth, Escher here and elsewhere uses conflicting proportions to create a visual [[paradox]]. The [[watercourse]] supplying the waterfall (its [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] or [[leat]]) has the structure of two [[Penrose triangle]]s. A Penrose triangle is an [[impossible object]] designed by [[Oscar Reutersvärd]] in 1934, and found independently by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="Penrose 1958"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Penrose | first1=L. S. | last2=Penrose | first2=R. | title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion
 | journal= British Journal of Psychology | year=1958 | volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=31–33 | doi= 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x | pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The image depicts a watermill with an elevated [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] and [[waterwheel]] as the main feature. The aqueduct begins at the waterwheel and flows behind it. The walls of the aqueduct step downward, suggesting that it slopes downhill. The aqueduct turns sharply three times, first to the left, then to the right, and finally to the left again. The viewer looks down at the scene diagonally, which means that from the viewer's perspective the aqueduct appears to be slanted upward. The viewer is also looking across the scene diagonally from the lower right, which means that from the viewer's perspective the two left-hand turns are directly in line with each other, while the waterwheel, the forward turn and the end of the aqueduct are all in line. The second left-hand turn is supported by pillars from the first, while the other two corners are supported by a tower of pillars that begins at the waterwheel. The water falls off the edge of the aqueduct and over the waterwheel in an impossible infinite cycle; in his notes on the picture, Escher points out that some water must be periodically added to this [[perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] to compensate for [[evaporation]]. The use of the Penrose stairs is paralleled by Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending (M. C. Escher)|Ascending and Descending]]'' (1960), where instead of the flow of water, two lines of monks endlessly march uphill or downhill around the four flights of stairs.&lt;ref name=MathSide&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schattschneider |first1=Doris| volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=706–718 |journal=Notices of the AMS |title=The Mathematical Side of M. C. Escher |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201006/rtx100600706p.pdf |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two support towers continue above the aqueduct and are topped by two compound [[polyhedra]], revealing Escher's interest in [[mathematics and art|mathematics as an artist]]. The one on the left is a [[compound of three cubes]]. The one on the right is a [[stellation]] of a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] (or a compound of three non-regular [[octahedron|octahedra]]) and is known as [[Compound of three octahedra|Escher's solid]].

Below the mill is a garden of bizarre, giant plants. This is actually a magnified view of a cluster of [[moss]] and [[lichen]] that Escher drew in ink as a study in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Locher, J. L. |year=1971 |title=The World of M. C. Escher |publisher=[[Abrams Books|Abrams]] |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background seems to be a climbing expanse of [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] farmland.

'''Yitzchok Moully''' is an [[Australian]]-[[Americans|American]], [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi and artist associated with the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement and is known for his "Chasidic Pop Art" painting style. Moully serves as a Chabad emissary (''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shaliach]]'') in [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=mishpop&gt;Bensoussan, Barbara. "True Color." ''Mishpacha Magazine''. July 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mishpop1&gt;[http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=20827&amp;alias=pop-artist-chossid-shliach "Pop Artist, Chossid, Shliach."] ''COLlive.com''. July 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=algepop&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/author/yitzchak-moully/ "Yitzchok Moully."] ''The Algemeiner Journal''. Accessed December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moully's combination of rabbinic work and art is expressed in a piece "Orange Socks."
The piece, according to Moully, contrasts what people think of as a homogeneous Chassidic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wischusen |first1=Phreddy |title=‘Under the Black Hat’ Pop Art in Jerusalem Focuses on Chassidim - Rabbi Yitzchok Moully brings spiritual and emotional depth to a new exhibit |url=https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/3824604/jewish/Under-the-Black-Hat-Pop-Art-in-Jerusalem-Focuses-on-Chassidim.htm |website=www.chabad.org |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |language=en |date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Yitzchok Moully was born in 1979&lt;ref name=forpop/&gt; in [[Queensland, Australia]] but moved to [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] at the age of three. At the age of five, Moully and his mother moved to [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]] and joined the Chabad community there. Moully later studied at Chabad yeshivoth, married, and became the assistant rabbi at the Chabad Jewish Center of Basking Ridge, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=mishpop/&gt;

==Art==
Moully has produced works by using the silkscreen process; his art contrasts strong Jewish and Chasidic images with vibrant bold colors creating what he describes as "Chassidic Pop Art."&lt;ref name=algepop/&gt; Moully uses color and styles similar to the work of [[Andy Warhol]], using popular images from Jewish Chasidic culture including [[dreidels]], [[Kiddush]] cups and praying rabbis.&lt;ref name=forpop&gt;Trappler-Spielman, Sara. [http://www.forward.com/articles/12739/hasidic-rabbi-by-day-pop-artist-by-night-/ Hasidic Rabbi by Day, Pop Artist by Night."] ''The Jewish Daily Forward''. Wednesday, February 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Moully also works in abstract art, and has been heavily influenced by artists such as by the French Canadian artist Jean Pierre Lafrance &lt;ref&gt;Peter Kharmandarian [http://www.artonthebanks.com/2015/05/interviews-the-pop-art-rabbi-yitzchok-moully/ Interview: The Pop Art Rabbi – Yitzchok Moully]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Moully began exhibiting his art in galleries and community centers in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Currently, his work is on exhibit at the gallery [[ArtisZen Arts]] in [[Lambertville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=forpop/&gt;

==The Creative Soul==
Moully founded a network of Orthodox Jewish artists called "The Creative Soul."&lt;ref name=mishpop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trappler-Spielman, Sara.

[http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/well-versed/supporting-israel-art "Supporting Israel With Art."] September 19, 2014.

April 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Creative Soul has organized an annual exhibition in Crown Heights during the Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot]]. The exhibition has included submissions from local Chabad artists including Yitzchok Moully and [[Michoel Muchnik]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crownheights.info/psa/47250/chassidic-artists-to-participate-in-group-art-show/ "Chassidic artists to participate in group art show."] ''CrownHeights.info''.

'''''Young Ladies Beside the Seine (Summer)''''' (French - ''Les Demoiselles des bords de la Seine (été)'') is an oil on canvas painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]. He painted it between late 1856 and early 1857 and presented it to the [[Paris Salon]] jury, which accepted it and exhibited it on 15 June 1857 with two portraits and three landscapes by the same artist. It was bought by Courbet's friend and patron [[Étienne Baudry]] (1830-1908), then left by him to the painter's daughter Juliette, who left it to the French state in 1906. It now hangs in the [[Petit Palais]] in Paris. A smaller (96.5 x 130 cm) sketch version is now in the [[National Gallery, London]].
