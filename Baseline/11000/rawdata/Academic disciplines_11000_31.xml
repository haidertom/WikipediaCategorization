An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

The '''art of the Third Reich''' was the government-approved art produced in [[Nazi Germany]] between 1933 and 1945. Upon becoming dictator in 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] gave his personal artistic preference the force of law to a degree rarely known before.

In the case of Germany, the model was to be [[Ancient Greek art|classical Greek]] and [[Roman art]], seen by [[Hitler]] as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; It was, furthermore, to be comprehensible to the average man.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy p335"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 335. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art was to be both [[heroic art|heroic]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]].&lt;ref name="Richard Overy p335"/&gt; The Nazis viewed the culture of the [[Weimar period]] with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from conservative [[aesthetics]] and partly from their determination to use culture as [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Adam110" /&gt;

==Theory== 
As indicated by historian Henry Grosshans in his book ''Hitler and the Artists'', Adolf Hitler who [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|came to power in 1933]] (quote): "saw Greek and [[Roman art]] as uncontaminated by Jewish influences. Modern art was [perceived by him as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler – wrote Grosshans – even though only [[Max Liebermann|Liebermann]], [[Ludwig Meidner|Meidner]], [[Otto Freundlich|Freundlich]], and [[Marc Chagall]], among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The supposedly "Jewish" nature of art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented "depraved" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race.

By propagating the theory of [[degenerate art]], the Nazis combined their [[anti-Semitism]] with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts in this regard were unquestionably aided by a popular hostility to Modernism that predated their movement.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', p. 161. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that such art had reflected Germany's condition and [[moral bankruptcy]] was widespread, and many artists acted in a manner to overtly undermine or challenge popular values and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 358. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-073-26, München, Haus der Deutschen Kunst.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The ''House of German Art'' in Munich]]

In July 1937, two officially sponsored exhibitions opened in [[Munich]]: ''Entartete Kunst'', (the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]), displayed modern art in a deliberately chaotic installation accompanied by defamatory labels that encouraged the public to jeer; in contrast, the ''[[:de:Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung|Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung]]'' (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial ''[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]'' (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. "The audience entered the portals of the new museum, already dubbed "Palazzo Kitschi" and "Munich Art Terminal", to a stultifying display carefully limited to idealized German peasant families, commercial art nudes, and heroic war scenes, including not just a few works by jurist [[Adolf Ziegler|Ziegler]] himself."&lt;ref name="Nicholas.1995.p.20"&gt;Nicholas.(1995).p.20&lt;/ref&gt; "...The show was essentially a flop and attendance was low. Sales were even worse and Hitler ended up buying most of the works for the government."&lt;ref name="Nicholas.1995.p.20"/&gt; At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, pp. 124-125"&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The early twentieth century was characterized by startling changes in artistic styles. In the visual arts, such innovations as [[cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[surrealism]], following hot on the heels of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[post-Impressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], were not universally appreciated. The majority of people in Germany, as elsewhere, did not care for the new art which many resented as elitist, morally suspect and too often incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
During recent years, Germany had become a major center of ''[[avant-garde]]'' art. It was the birthplace of [[Expressionism]] in [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], the [[Atonal music|atonal]] musical compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the jazz-influenced work of [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. [[Robert Wiene]]'s'' [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' brought expressionism to [[Film|cinema]].

===Creation of the ''Reichskulturkammer''===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34639, Joseph Goebbels und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Goebbels with film director [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in 1937]]
In September 1933 the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with [[Joseph Goebbels]], Hitler's ''Reichminister für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda'' (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and [[Propaganda]]) in charge.&lt;ref name="overy361"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 361. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual divisions in the Chamber of Culture for the Reich included: "press, radio, literature, movies, theater, music, and visual arts." &lt;ref name="Baez, 2004 pp. 211"&gt;Baez, 2004 pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt; "The purpose of this chamber was to stimulate the [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] of German culture and to prohibit, for example, atonal Jewish music, the blues, surrealism, cubism, and Dadaism." &lt;ref name="Baez, 2004 pp. 211"/&gt;

===Laws targeting culture in the Third Reich===
By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="Adam53" /&gt; Goebbels made clear that: "In the future only those who are members of the chamber will be allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfil the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded."&lt;ref name="Adam53"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless there was, during the period 1933–1934, some confusion within the Party on the question of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]]. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[Erich Heckel]] exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, "We National Socialists are not un-modern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, a faction led by Rosenberg despised Expressionism, leading to a bitter ideological dispute which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.

# Document No. 2030-PS: ''Decree Concerning the Duties of the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda of June 1933'' stated that: "The Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination of the nation, of propagandizing the State, of cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the public at home and abroad; furthermore, he is in charge of the administration of all institutions serving these purposes" &lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2030-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the jurisdiction of the Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to include "enlightenment in foreign countries; art; art exhibitions; moving pictures and sport abroad" … [and increased jurisdiction in domestic] "Press (including the Institute for Journalism); Radio; National anthem; German Library in Leipzig; Art; Music (including the Philharmonic Orchestra); Theater; Moving Pictures; Campaign against dirty and obscene literature" … Propaganda for tourism." Signed by The Reich Chancellor, Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2030-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School&lt;/ref&gt;
# Document No. 2078-PS: ''Decree concerning the establishment of the Reichs Ministry of Science, Education and Popular Culture of 1 May 1934'' stated that: "The Chancellor of the Reich will determine the various duties of the Reich Ministry for Science, Education, and Popular Culture." &lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2078-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by The President of the Reich, von Hindenburg, and The Chancellor of the Reich, Adolf Hitler.
# Document No. 1708-PS: ''The program of the NSDAP'' stated that: only members of the German race can be citizens (Jews, specifically are denied citizenship), and that non-members of the race can only live in Germany as registered ‘guests’. Point 23 stated: "We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.&lt;ref&gt;Document No. 1708-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Fordham University: The Jesuit University of New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres in the Third Reich==
Belief in a Germanic spirit—defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the Nazis; [[Richard Wagner]] celebrated such ideas in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning before World War I the well-known German architect and painter [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]]'s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and architecture, supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 29-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi art bears a close similarity to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda art style of [[Socialist Realism]], and the term [[heroic realism]] has sometimes been used to describe both artistic styles. Among the well-known artists endorsed by the Nazis were the sculptors [[Josef Thorak]] and [[Arno Breker]], and painters [[Werner Peiner]], [[Arthur Kampf]], [[Adolf Wissel]] and [[Conrad Hommel]]. In July 1937, four years after it came to power, the Nazi party put on two art exhibitions in [[Munich]]. The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of, depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealized soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of [[German art]]: modern, abstract, non-representational—or as the Nazis saw it, "degenerate".

According to Klaus Fischer, "Nazi art, in short, was colossal, impersonal, and stereotypical. People were shorn of all individuality and became mere emblems expressive of assumed eternal truths. In looking at Nazi architecture, art, or painting one quickly gains the feeling that the faces, shapes, and colors all serve a propagandistic purpose; they are all the same stylized statements of Nazi virtues—power, strength, solidity, Nordic beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:Closs St Georg mit Hakenkreuz.jpg|thumb|A Nazi St George killing the dragon (Flealeaf of a book about Heraldry)]]
[[File:1897_Dettmann_Bei_den_Wasserrosen_im_Moor_anagoria.JPG|thumb|Water-lilies by the Nazi painter [[Ludwig Dettmann]] (listed in the [[Gottbegnadeten list|God-gifted list]])]]

Art of the Third Reich was characterized by a style of [[Romantic realism]] based on [[Greek art|classical models]]. While banning modern styles as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]], the Nazis promoted paintings that were narrowly traditional in manner and that exalted the "[[blood and soil]]" values of [[racial purity]], [[militarism]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)#Cultural attitudes to obedience|obedience]]. Other popular themes for Nazi art were the [[Volk (German word)#Nazi era|Volk]] at work in the fields, a return to the simple virtues of [[Heimat]] (love of homeland), the manly virtues of the National Socialist struggle, and the lauding of the female activities of child bearing and raising symbolized by the phrase ''[[Kinder, Küche, Kirche]]'' ("children, kitchen, church").

In general, painting—once purged of "degenerate art"—was based on traditional [[genre painting]].&lt;ref name="Adam110"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Titles were purposeful: "Fruitful Land", "Liberated Land", "Standing Guard", "Through Wind and Weather", "Blessing of Earth", and the like.&lt;ref name="Adam110" /&gt; Hitler's favorite painter was [[Adolf Ziegler]] and Hitler owned a number of his works. [[Landscape painting]] featured prominently in the Great German Art exhibition.&lt;ref name="Frederic Spotts p 176"&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', p 176 {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While drawing on [[German Romanticism]] traditions, it was to be firmly based on real landscape, Germans' [[Lebensraum]], without religious moods.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants were also popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; This art showed no sign of the mechanization of farm work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The farmer labored by hand, with effort and struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Not a single painting in the first exhibition showed urban or industrialized life, and only two in the exhibition in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', p. 427, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi theory explicitly rejected "materialism", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, "realism" was a seldom used term.&lt;ref name="Adam138"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity.&lt;ref name="Adam138" /&gt; The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; with physical perfection required for the nude paintings.&lt;ref name="sontag3"&gt;[[Susan Sontag]]",[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/feb/06/fascinating-fascism/?page=3 Fascinating Fascism]"&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the cause of there being very few anti-Semitic paintings; while such works as ''Um Haus and Hof'', depicting a Jewish speculator dispossessing an elderly peasant couple exist, they are few, perhaps because the art was supposed to be on a higher plane.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly political paintings were more common but still very rare.&lt;ref name="Frederic Spotts p 176"/&gt; Heroic imagery, on the other hand, was common enough to be commented on by a critic: "The heroic element stands out. The worker, the farmer, the soldier are the themes .... Heroic subjects dominate over sentimental ones".&lt;ref name="censure"&gt;''[http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/art5.htm The Greater German Art Exhibitions]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131032526/http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/art5.htm |date=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of war, [[military art|war paintings]] became far more common.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The images were romanticized, depicting heroic sacrifice and victory.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Still, landscapes predominated, and among the painters exempted from war service, all were noted for landscapes or other pacific subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', pp. 176-178. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Hitler and Goebbels found the new paintings disappointing, although Goebbels tried to put a good face on it with the observation that they had cleared the field, and that these desperate times drew many talents into political life rather than cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the ''Great German Art Exhibition'' in Munich Hitler said in 1939:

{{quote|The first goal of our new German creation of art [...] has surely been achieved. Analogous to the recovering of architectural art which began here in Munich, here also started the purification in the sphere of painting and sculpture, that maybe had been even more devastated. The whole swindle of a decadent or pathological trend-art has been swept away. A decent common level has been reached. And this means a lot. Only out of this can the truly creative genius arise."&lt;ref&gt;Max Domarus, Hitler: Reden und Proklamationen 1932–1945. Kommentiert von einem Zeitzeugen. Wiesbaden, 1973, page 1218, {{ISBN|3-927068-00-4}}. Original Text: "... das erste Ziel unseres neuen deutschen Kunstschaffens [...] ohne Zweifel schon heute erreicht [sei]. So wie von dieser Stadt München die baukünstlerische Gesundung ihren Ausgang nahm, hat hier auch vor drei Jahren die Reinigung eingesetzt auf dem vielleicht noch mehr verwüsteten Gebiet der Plastik und der Malerei. Der ganze Schwindelbetrieb einer dekadenten oder krankhaften, verlogenen Modekunst ist hinweggefegt. Ein anständiges allgemeines Niveau wurde erreicht. Und dieses ist sehr viel. Denn aus ihm erst können sich die wahrhaft schöpferischen Genies erheben." (07/14/1939)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1938, nearly 16,000 works by German and non-German artists had been seized from German galleries and either sold abroad or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Arno Breker, Albert Speer (1940).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Arno Breker]] sculpting a bust of [[Albert Speer]], the Reich armaments minister]]

The monumental possibilities of sculpture offered greater material expression of the theories of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Adam177"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great German Art Exhibition'' promoted the genre of sculpture at the expense of painting.&lt;ref name="Adam177" /&gt; As such, the nude male was the most common representation of the ideal Aryan; the artistic skill of [[Arno Breker]] elevated him to become the favourite sculptor of Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 Caroline Fetscher, "Why Mention Arno Breker Today?", ''The Atlantic Times'', August 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083704/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Josef Thorak]] was another official sculptor whose monumental style suited the image the Third Reich wished to communicate to the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821298,00.html Art: Bigger Than Life]"&lt;/ref&gt; Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the physical form of the ideal Nazi man and woman showed no imperfections.&lt;ref name="sontag3"/&gt;

===Music===
Music was expected to be [[Tonality|tonal]] and free of [[jazz]] influence; [[Nazism and cinema|films]] and plays were [[censorship|censored]]. "Musical fare alternated between light music in the form of folk songs or popular hits (''Schlager'') and such acceptable classical music as [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]], and Italian Opera."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's urban centers in the 1920s and 30s were buzzing with jazz clubs, cabaret houses and avant garde music. In contrast, the National Socialist regime made concentrated efforts to shun modern music (which was considered degenerate and Jewish in nature) and instead embraced classical German music. Highly favored was music which alluded to a mythic, heroic German past such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Anton Bruckner]] was highly favored as his music was regarded as an expression of the [[zeitgeist]] of the German [[volk]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyerman &amp; Jamison 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The music of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (and atonal music along with it), [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and many others was banned because the composers were Jewish or of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hindemith]] fled to Switzerland in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael|title=The Concerto : A Listener's Guide|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019802634X|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8oXNX2tY8AC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than fit his music into Nazi ideology. Some operas of [[Georg Friederich Händel]] were either banned outright for themes sympathetic to Jews and Judaism or had new librettos written for them. German composers who had their music performed more often during the Nazi period were [[Max Reger]] and [[Hans Pfitzner]]. [[Richard Strauss]] continued to be the most performed contemporary German composer, as he had been prior to the Nazi regime. However, even Strauss had his opera [[Die Schweigsame Frau|The Silent Woman]] banned in 1935 due to his Jewish librettist [[Stefan Zweig]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1994, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music by non-German composers was tolerated if it was classically inspired, tonal, and not by a composer of Jewish origin or having ties to ideologies hostile to the Third Reich. The Nazis recognized [[Franz Liszt]] for having German origin and fabricated a genealogy that purported that [[Frédéric Chopin]] was German, and the Nazi [[Hans Frank|Governor-General of occupied Poland]] even had a "Chopin Museum" built in [[Kraków]]. Music of the Russian [[Peter Tchaikovsky]] could be performed in Nazi Germany even after [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Operas by [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]] got frequent play.  The most performed modern non-German composers prior to the outbreak of war were [[Claude Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the outbreak of war, the music of German allies became more often performed, including the Hungarian [[Béla Bartók]], the Italian [[Ottorino Resphigi]] and Finnish Jean Sibelius. Composers of enemy nations (such as Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky) were largely banned and almost never performed – although there were some exceptions.

There has been controversy over the use of certain composers' music by the Nazi regime, and whether that implicates the composer as implicitly Nazi. Composers such as Richard Strauss,&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1992&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the first director of the Propaganda Ministry's music division, and [[Carl Orff]] have been subject to extreme criticism and heated defense.&lt;ref&gt;Kater 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kater 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were quickly prohibited from performing or conducting classical music in Germany. Such conductors as [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Ignatz Waghalter]], [[Josef Krips]], and [[Kurt Sanderling]] fled Germany. Upon the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, the conductor [[Karel Ančerl]] was blacklisted as a Jew and was sent in turn to [[Theresienstadt]] and [[Auschwitz]].

====Musicologists of the Third Reich====
As the Nazi regime accrued power in 1933, musicologists were directed to rewrite the history of German music in order to accommodate Nazi mythology and ideology. [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Hans Pfitzner]] were notable preexisting composers who conceptualized a united order (''Volksgemeinschaft'') where music was an index of the German community. In a time of disintegration, Wagner and Pfitzner wanted to revitalize the country through music. In a book written about Hans Pfitzner and Wagner, published in Regensburg in 1939 followed not only the birth of contemporary musical parties, but also of political parties in Germany. The Wagner-Pfitzner stance contrasted ideas of other notable artists—[[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]]—who wanted music to be autonomous from politics, Nazi control and application. Although Wagner and Pfitzner came before the Third Reich, their sentiments and thoughts, Wagner's ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', were appropriated by Hitler and his propagandists—notably [[Joseph Goebbels]]. According to Michael Meyer, "The very emphasis on rootedness and on tradition music underscored Nazi understanding of itself in a dialectic terms: old gods were mobilized against the false values of the immediate past to offer legitimacy to the epiphany of Adolf Hitler and the music representation of his realm."{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Composers, librettists, educators, critics, and especially musicologists, through their public statements, intellectual writings, and journals contributed to the justification of a totalitarian blueprint to be implanted through nazification. All music was then composed for the occasions of Nazi pageantries, rallies, and conventions. Composers dedicated so called 'consecration fanfares,' inaugurations fanfares and flag songs to the Fuhrer. When the Fuhrer assumed power the Nazi revolution was immediately expressed in musicological journalism. Certain progressive journalism pertaining to modern music was purged. Journals that had been sympathetic to the ‘German viewpoint,’ entrenched in Wagnerian ideals, like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'' and ''Die Musik'', showed confidence in the new regime and affirmed the process of intertwining government policies with music. Joseph Goebbels used the ''Völkischer Beobachter'', a journal that was disseminated to the general public in addition to elites and party officials, as an organ of Reich Culture. By the end of the 1930s the ''Mitteilungen der Reichsmusikkammer'' became another prominent journal that reflected the music policy, organizational and personnel changes in musical institutions.

In the early years of the Third Reich, the musicologists and musicians redirected the orientation of music, defining what was "German Music" and what was not. Nazi ideology was applied to the evaluation of musicians for hero status; musicians defined in the new German musical era were given titles of prophets, while their accomplishments and deeds were seen as direct accomplishments of the Nazi regime. The contribution of German musicologists led to the justification of Nazi power and a new German music culture in whole. The musicologists defined the greater German values that musicians would have to identify with, because their duty was to integrate music and National Socialism in way that made them look inseparable. Nazi myth making and ideology was forced upon the new musical path of the Third Reich rather than truly embedded in the rhetoric of German music.

===Graphic design===
The poster became an important medium for propaganda during this period. Combining text and bold graphics, posters were extensively deployed both in Germany and in the areas occupied. Their [[typography]] reflected the Nazis' official ideology. The use of [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] was common in Germany until 1941, when [[Martin Bormann]] denounced the typeface as "Judenlettern" and decreed that only [[Roman type]] should be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/tools/citex?clienttype=1&amp;subtype=1&amp;mode=1&amp;version=1&amp;id=118830484&amp;redirect=/journal/118830484/abstract/ Newton, Gerald, 2003, "''Deutsche Schrift'': The Demise and Rise of German Black Letter", ''German Life and Letters'', 56:2 (abstract).]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[sans-serif]] typefaces were condemned as [[cultural Bolshevism]], although [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] continued to be used owing to its practicality.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis 2001, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery frequently drew on [[heroic realism]].&lt;ref name="design"&gt;eye magazine, "[http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=62&amp;fid=270 Designing heroes]"&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi youth and the SS were depicted monumentally, with lighting posed to produce grandeur.&lt;ref name="design"/&gt;
Graphic design also played a part in the Third Reich through the use of the [http://www.dailyslave.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/swastika2.jpg swastika.]&lt;ref name="Hitler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.time.com/world-war-ii/nazi-propaganda-and-the-myth-of-aryan-invincibility/#1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103024627/http://life.time.com/world-war-ii/nazi-propaganda-and-the-myth-of-aryan-invincibility/ |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swastika was in existence long before Hitler came into power—serving purposes that were much more benign than the ones it [the swastika] is associated with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_swastika_constructing_the_symbol|title=Typotheque: The Swastika: Constructing The Symbol by Steven Heller|author=|date=|website=www.typotheque.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the stark, graphic lines used to create a swastika, it was a symbol that was very easy to remember.&lt;ref name= "Hitler"/&gt;

===Literature===
The Reich Chamber of Literature ''Reichsschriftstumskammer''&lt;ref&gt;Mosse 1966, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
Literature was under the jurisdiction of Goebbels's Ministry of Propaganda and Popular Enlightenment. According to Grunberger, "At the beginning of the war this department supervised no less than 2,500 publishing houses, 23,000 bookshops, 3,000 authors, 50 national literary prizes, 20,000 new books issued annually, and a total of 1 million titles constituting the available book market."&lt;ref name="Grunberger 1971, p. 361"&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was Europe's biggest producer of books—in terms both of total annual production and the number of individual new titles appearing each year.&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, at 650 million RM, the average sales value of the books produced took third place in the statistics on goods, after coal and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Socialist literature commission, set itself the goal of eradicating the literature of the ‘System Period’, as Weimar was contemptuously called, and of propagating volkisch-nationalist literature in the Nazis state.&lt;ref name="Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28"&gt;Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Literature was recognized early on as an essential political tool in the Third Reich as virtually 100 percent of the German population was literate.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; "The most widely-read-or displayed-book of the period was Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'', a collection (according to [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]) of 164,000 offences against German grammar and syntax; by 1940, it was, with 6 million copies sold, the solitary front-runner in the German best-seller list, some 5 million copies ahead of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and others."&lt;ref name="Grunberger 1971, p. 361"/&gt;

Richard Grunberger says, "In 1936 literary criticism as hitherto understood was abolished; henceforth reviews followed a pattern: a synopsis of content studded with quotations, marginal comments on style, a calculation of the degree of concurrence with Nazi doctrine and a conclusion indicating approval or otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Reich permitted much foreign literature to be read, in part because they believed that the writings of authors such as [[John Steinbeck]] and [[Erskine Caldwell]] substantiated the Nazis' condemnation of Western society as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the United States entered the war, all foreign authors were strictly censored. Themes in Nazi literature were defined as a range of "permissible literary expression" largely limited to four subjects: war, [[Nazism and race]], [[blood and soil]], and the [[Nazi movement]]."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, pp. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Fronterlebnis'' (War as a Spiritual Experience)====

This was one of the most popular themes during the interwar period. Writers celebrated the "heroics of front-line soldiers in [World War I], ... the thrill of combat and the sacredness of death when it is in the service of the fatherland."&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; Popular writers in this genre included [[Ernst Jünger]] and Werner Beumelburg [[:de:Werner Beumelburg|(de)]], an ex-officer.&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"&gt;Fischer 1997, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent books include [[Ernst Junger]]'s ''Storm of Steel'' (1920), ''Struggle as Inner Experience'' (1922), ''Storms'' (1933), ''Fire and Blood'' (1925), ''The Adventurous Heart'' (1929), and ''Total Mobilization'' (1931).

====''Blut und Boden'' (Blood and Soil)====

Novels in this theme often featured an instinctive and soil-bound peasant community that warded off alien outsiders who sought to destroy their way of life.&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; 
The most popular novel of this kind was [[Hermann Lons]]'s ''[[Der Wehrwolf|Wehrwolf]]'' published in 1910.

====Historical ethnicity====
Klaus Fischer says Nazi literature emphasized "Historic Ethnicity—that is, how a group of people defines itself in a process of historical growth. Writers tried to highlight prominent episodes in the history of the German people; they stressed the German mission for Europe, analyzed the immutable racial essence of Nordic man, and warned against subversive or un-German forces—the Jews, Communists, or Western liberals."&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; Prominent writers included: [[Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer]] (''Die Bauhutte: Elemente einer Metaphysik der Gerenwart''; The building hut: Elements of a contemporary metaphysics, 1925), [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (''Der Mythus des 20.Jahrhunderts''; The myth of the twentieth century, 1930), [[Josef Weinheber]], [[Hans Grimm]] (''Volk ohne Raum''; People [[Lebensraum|without living space]], 1926), and [[Joseph Goebbels]] (''Michael'', 1929).

===Architecture===
{{main|Nazi architecture}}
Hitler favored hugeness, especially in architecture, as a means of impressing the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; "A once mediocre artist and aspiring architect, Hitler also pronounced upon the "decadence" of modern art and pushed his planners to create monumental buildings in older [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] or [[art deco]] styles." &lt;ref&gt;Sivers, Desnoyers and Stow 2012, p.1008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
{{main|Nazism and cinema}}
"The Reich Film Chamber (''Reichsfilmkammer'') controlled the lively German film industry, while a Film Credit Bank (also under Goebbels' control) centralized the financial aspects of film production." &lt;ref&gt;Mosse 1966, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1363 feature pictures were made in the Third Reich (208 of these were banned after World War II for containing Nazi Propaganda).&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1969, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Every film made in the Third Reich (including features, shorts, newsreels, and documentaries) had to be passed by Joseph Goebbels himself before they could be shown in public.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1969, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plakat_der_ewige_Jude,_1937.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for ''The Eternal Jew'' exhibition, 1937]]
Mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture, possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, until the outbreak of the war, most Hollywood films could be screened, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. While performance of atonal music was banned, the prohibition of jazz was less strictly enforced. [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] were popular, and leading English and American jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war; thereafter, dance bands officially played "swing" rather than the banned jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

A film premiered in Berlin on November 28, 1940, which was clearly a tool used to promote Nazi Ideology. The release of the film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (The Eternal Jew) was only two months prior to the announcement made by German officials of the establishment of the ghetto in [[Łódź]]. The film was portrayed in the Nazi press as a documentary to emphasize the cinema as truth, when in reality it was nothing more than propaganda to raise hatred against the Jewish community in its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 80, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker, [[Fritz Hippler]], used numerous visual techniques to portray Jews as a filthy, degenerate, and disease infested population. Purporting to provide the viewer with an in depth look at the Jewish lifestyle, the film showed staged scenes of Łódź (soon to be ghetto) with the presence of flies and rats, to suggest a dangerous-to-life area of Europe; which in turn only perpetuated underlying superstition and fear to the viewer. To add to this staged and exaggerated scene of filth was a warning released by officials of The [[Reich]]: an advisory that Łódź is an area of widespread infectious disease. The film director utilized racist cinema to bolster the illusion that Jews were parasites and corruptors of German culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 80, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippler made use of [[voice-over]]s to cite hate speeches or fictitious statistics of the Jewish population. He also borrowed numerous scenes from other films, and presented them out of context from the original: for example, a scene of a Jewish businessman in the United States hiding money was accompanied with a bogus claim that Jewish men get taxed more than non-Jews in the United States, which was used to insinuate that Jews withhold money from the government. Through the repetitive use of side angles of Jewish people, who were filmed (without knowledge) while looking over their shoulder at the camera, ''Der ewige Jude'' created a visual suggesting a shifty and conspiring nature of Jews. Yet another propaganda technique was superposition. Hippler superimposed the [[Star of David]] onto the tops of world capitals, insinuating an illusion of Jewish world domination.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;
	
''Der ewige Jude'' is notorious for its anti-Semitism and its use of cinema in the fabrication of propaganda, to satisfy Hitler and to embrace the Germanic ideology that would fuel a nation in support of an obsessive leader.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
"On the lighter side, a Jewish actor named Leo Reuss fled Germany to Vienna, where he dyed his hair and beard and became a specialist in ‘Aryan’ roles, which were greatly praised by the Nazis. Having had his fun, Reuss revealed he was a Jew, signed a contract with MGM, and departed for the United States" &lt;ref name="Hull 1969, p. 127"&gt;Hull 1969, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hitler Museum==
{{main|Führermuseum}}

[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|200px|right|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (right) inspects stolen artwork in a salt mine in [[Merkers]], accompanied by [[Omar Bradley]] (left) and [[George S. Patton]] (center)]]
Apart from auctioning art that was to be purged from Germany's collection, Germany's art that was considered as especially favourable by Hitler were to be combined to create a massive art museum in Hitler's hometown of [[Linz]], Austria for his own personal collection. The museum to-be by 1945 had thousands of pieces of furniture, paintings, sculptures and several other forms of fine craft. The museum was to be known as the "[[Führermuseum]]". By the late spring of 1940 art collectors and museum curators were in a race against time to move thousands of pieces of collectables into hiding, or out of soon-to-be-occupied territory where it would be vulnerable to confiscation by German officials—either for themselves, or for the Führer. On June 5, a particularly important movement of thousands of paintings occurred, which included the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', and all were hidden in the Loc-Dieu Abbey located near [[Martiel]] during the chaos of invasion by German forces. Art dealers did their best to hide artwork in the best places possible; [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]] managed to move over 150 great pieces to a [[Libourne]] bank, which included works by [[Monet]], [[Matisse]], Picasso, and van Gogh. Other collectors did whatever they could to remove France's artistic treasures to the safest locations feasible at the time; filling cars, or large crates en route to [[Vichy]], or south through France and into Spain to reach transport by boat. Art dealer Martin Fabiani moved mass quantities of pictures: drawings and paintings to be boarded onto a ship so that the prized possessions were to be in safer keeping on British soil in [[Bermuda]], although when the ship's contents arrived, complications arose over proof of ownership of foreign assets from France. British consuls were wary of exports and carefully inspected shipments from France, after which Fabiani's assets were relocated to Canada, in the charge of the [[Registrar General of Canada|Registrar]] of the [[Exchequer Court of Canada]] where they were to remain until the end of the war. Similar shipments landed in New York, all in an effort to protect artistic treasures from confiscation, theft, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of June, Hitler controlled most of the European continent. As people were detained, their possessions were confiscated; if they were lucky enough to escape, their belongings left behind or in storage became the property of Germany. By the end of August, officials of the Reich were granted permission to access any shipping containers and remove any desirable items inside. As well as looting goods that were to be shipped out of occupied territories, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] authorized the removal of any objects found in houses during the invasion, after which a long and thorough search was in effect for European treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Artwork became an important commodity in the German economy: no one in German or axis-controlled countries was allowed to invest outside of the new Germanic-controlled territory, which in turn created a self-contained market. With few options available for investments, art was of great importance to anyone with cash, including the [[Führer]] himself, as a safe form of investment, and even in trade for the lives of others. At the height of trading in 1943, art was used by [[Pieter de Boers]], who was the head of Dutch association of Art Dealers, and the largest seller to Germans in the Netherlands, in the exchange of the release of his Jewish employee. Demand began to increase dramatically, forcing prices to rise, and only furthering the desire to discover hidden treasures within occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

As exploration continued within [[occupied France]], and by order of the Führer, a list was created which included all of the great works of art in France, and the German Currency Unit began to open private bank units which contained countless collectors' property and possible items on the list. The owner of the vault was required to be present. One particular investigation of a vault was that of Pablo Picasso; he chose a rather clever tactic when soldiers searched the contents of his vault. He packed his own artworks with countless other artists’ works of his collection in a chaotic manner, with the result that the investigators thought that nothing in the collection was significant, and took nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

As confiscations began to pile up in massive quantities, the items filled the Louvre, and forced Reich officials to use the [[Jeu de Paume]], a small museum, for additional space, and for proper viewing of the collection. The grand stockpile of art was ready for Hitler to choose from: the Führer had first choice for his own collection; second were objects that would complete collections of the [[Reichsmarschall]]; third was intended for whatever was useful to support Nazi ideology; a fourth category was created for German museums. Everything was supposed to be appraised and paid for, with proceeds being directed to French war-orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, pp. 125,126,128,129&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler also ordered the confiscation of French works of art owned by the state and the cities. Reich officials decided what was to stay in France, and what was to be sent to [[Linz]]. Further orders from the Führer also included the return of artworks that were looted by [[Napoleon]] from Germany in the past. Napoleon is considered the unquestioned record holder in the act of confiscating art.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art theft===
{{main|Nazi plunder}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|280px|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing in front of [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome in 1944 with a picture taken from the Biblioteca del [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale di Napoli]] before the Allied forces' arrival in the city ''Carlo III di Borbone che visita il papa Benedetto XIV nella coffee-house del Quirinale a Roma'' by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]] inv. Q 205)]]
Later, as the occupiers of Europe, the Germans trawled the museums and private collections of Europe for suitably "Aryan" art to be acquired to fill a bombastic new gallery in Hitler's home town of [[Linz]]. At first a pretense was made of exchanges of works (sometimes with [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] masterpieces, considered degenerate by the Nazis), but later acquisitions came through forced "donations" and eventually by simple looting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/articles-and-papers/symposium-papers/conducting-research-art-looting.html Conducting Research at the National Archives into Art Looting, Recovery, and Restitution] by Ernest Latham, US National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

The purge of art in Germany and occupied countries was extremely broad. The Nazi theft is considered to be the largest art theft in modern history including paintings, furniture, sculptures, and anything in between considered either valuable, or opposing Hitler's purification of German culture. During the Second World War, art theft by German forces was devastating, and the resurfacing of missing stolen art continues today, along with the fight for rightful ownership. Not only did the [[Reich]] confiscate and reallocate countless masterpieces from occupied territories during the war, but also put to auction a large portion of Germany's collection of great art from museums and art galleries. In the end, the confiscation committees removed over 15,000 works of art from German public collections alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Warsaw 1944 by Bałuk - 26320.jpg|thumb|left|Column of lorries in front of a [[Zachęta|Warsaw museum]] [[World War II looting of Poland|loaded with stolen art treasures]], 1944]]

It took four years to "refine" the Nazi art criteria; in the end what was tolerated was whatever Hitler liked, and whatever was most useful to the German government from the point of view of creating propaganda. A thorough head-hunting of artists within Germany was in effect from the beginning of the Second World War, which included the elimination of countless members within the art community. Museum directors that supported modern art were attacked; artists that refused to comply with Reich-approved art were forbidden to practice art altogether. To enforce the prohibition of practicing art, agents of the [[Gestapo]] routinely made unexpected visits to artist's homes and studios. Wet brushes found during the inspections or even the smell of turpentine in the air was reason enough for arrest. In response to the oppressive restrictions, many artists chose to flee Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, pp. 10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Degenerate-Auction.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A confiscated self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]] is auctioned at Gallerie Fisher, Lucerne, in 1939.

Retrieved December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Before the impending war and a time of simply looting occupied nation's art treasures, but during the Reich's efforts to free Germany of conflicting art, authorities of the Nazi party realized the potential revenue of Germany's own collection of art that was considered [[degenerate art]] which was to be purged from German culture. The Reich began to collect and auction countless pieces of art—for example, "on June 30, 1939 a major auction took place at the elegant Grand Hotel National in the Swiss resort town of [[Lucerne]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; All of the paintings and sculptures had recently been on display in museums throughout Germany. This collection offered over 100 paintings and sculptures by numerous famous artists, such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]; all of which were considered "degenerate" pieces by Nazi authorities and were to be banished from Germany. An auction of this magnitude was viewed as suspicious by potential buyers, who feared that the profits would end up funding the Nazi party: "The auctioneer had been so worried about this perception that he had sent letters to leading dealers assuring them that all profits would be used for German museums".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all of the proceeds from the auction were deposited into "German controlled-accounts", and the museums "... as all had suspected, did not receive a penny".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual NSDAP artists==
According to Klaus Fischer – "Many German writers, artists, musicians, and scientists not only stayed but flourished under the Nazis, including some famous names such as [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Max Planck]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and many others".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, pp.374-375&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944 the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] prepared a list of 1,041 artists considered crucial to National Socialist culture, and therefore exempt from war service. This [[Gottbegnadeten list]] provides a well-documented index to the painters, sculptors, architects and filmmakers who were regarded by the Nazis as politically sympathetic, culturally valuable, and still residing in Germany at this late stage of the war.

{{main|Degenerate art}}
Hitler's rise to power on January 31, 1933, was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy: [[book burnings]] were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, artists were forbidden to utilize any colors not apparent in nature, to the "normal eye",&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; and curators who had shown a partiality to modern art were replaced by Nazi Party members.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; "Through the Ministry of Propaganda or the ERR, the Nazis destroyed or quarantined the culture of all the nations they invaded."&lt;ref name="Baez 2004, p. 211"&gt;Baez 2004, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; "A four-man purge tribunal (Professor Ziegler, Schweitzer-Mjolnir, Count Baudissin and Wolf willrich) toured galleries and museums all over the Reich and ordered the removal of paintings, drawings and sculptures that were regarded as 'degenerate'." &lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; "The swathe these four apocalyptic Norsemen cut through Germany's stored-up artistic treasure has been estimated at upwards of 16,000 paintings, drawings, etchings and sculptures: 1,000 pieces by [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]], 700 by [[Haeckel]], 600 each by [[Schmidt-Rottluff]] and [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], 500 by [[Beckmann]], 400 by [[Kokoschka]], 300-400 each by [[Hofer]], [[Max Pechstein|Pechstein]], [[Barlach]], [[Feininger]] and [[Otto Muller]], 200-300 each by [[Otto Dix|Dix]], [[Grosz]] and [[Corinth]], 100 by [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck|Lehmbruck]], as well as much smaller numbers of [[Cézanne]]s, [[Picasso]]s, Matisses, [[Gauguin]]s, [[Van Gogh]]s, Braques, Pisarros, Dufys, Chiricos and [[Max Ernst]]."&lt;ref name="Grunberger.1971.p.425"&gt;Grunberger 1971, p.425&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, 4000 of those works seized were "burned in the courtyard of the headquarters of the Berlin Fire-brigade."&lt;ref name="Grunberger.1971.p.425"/&gt;

The term ''Entartung'' (or "degeneracy") had gained popularity in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author [[Max Nordau]] devised the theory presented in his 1892 book, ''Entartung''.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Nordau drew upon the writings of the [[criminology|criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]], whose ''The Criminal Man'', published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were "born criminals" whose [[atavism|atavistic]] personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of [[modern art]], explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. Explaining the [[painterly|painterliness]] of [[Impressionism]] as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish (as was Lombroso), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German National Socialists during the [[Weimar Republic]] as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for [[Aryan race|Aryan]] purity in art.

Germany lost "thousands of intellectuals, artists, and academics, including many luminaries of Weimar culture and science", according to Raffael Scheck.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, Raffael.(2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer says that "as soon as Hitler seized power, many intellectuals rushed to the exits."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proscribed literature===
According to Pauley, "literature was the first branch of the arts to be affected by the Nazis."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"&gt;Pauley, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; "As early as April 1933, the Nazis had compiled a long blacklist of ''left'', democratic, and Jewish authors which included several famous authors of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"/&gt; Large scale [[book burning]]s were staged across Germany in May 1933. Two thousand five hundred writers, including Nobel prize winners and writers of worldwide best sellers, left the country voluntarily or under duress, and were replaced by people without international reputations."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"/&gt;

In June, 1933 the ''Reichsstelle zur Forderung des deutschen Schrifttums'' (Reich Office for the Promotion of German Literature) was established.&lt;ref name="Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28"/&gt; Jan-Pieter Barbian says, "On the level of the state, the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda and the Reich Chamber of Literature had to share responsibility for literary policy with the new Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and Public Instruction and the Foreign Office."&lt;ref name="Barbian_9"/&gt; "The full repertoire—which also included the consistent removal of Jews and political opponents—was brought to bear during the twelve years of Nazi rule: on writers and publishers; book wholesaling; the retail, door-to-door, and mail-order book libraries, public libraries, and research libraries."&lt;ref name="Barbian_9"&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November 1933 and January 1934 publishers were informed "that supplying and distributing the works named is undesirable for national and cultural reasons and must therefore cease."&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers, who often faced enormous economic losses when books were banned, received letters stating that the "authorities responsible would proceed against any indiscretion in the most rigorous manner".&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Companies which had published primarily "the fiction of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], and [[New Objectivity]]; modern translated literature; and critical nonfiction ... suffered enormous economic losses."&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"/&gt; A few of the hardest hit publishers were Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, S.Fischer Verlag, Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlags-AG, Rowohlt, Ullstein Verlags-AG, and Kurt Wolff Verlags.&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"/&gt; In 1935, the same year that "[[Goebbels]] assumed complete control over censorship," the Reichsschrifttumskammer banned the work of 524 authors.&lt;ref name="Baez 2004, p. 211"/&gt; "The Office for the Supervision of Ideological Training and Education of the NSDAP...became another watchdog of the state, spying on writers, developing black lists, encouraging book burnings, and emptying museums of 'non-German' works of art."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.365&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments varied, some individuals were censored or had their work destroyed or publicly ridiculed, while others were incarcerated in concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

"During World War II, 1939–1945, identical indexes of forbidden literature were applied by the Nazis in all occupied countries as well as in Germany's allied countries: Denmark, Norway, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, and of course, Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Karolides 2011, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book burnings===
{{main|Nazi book burnings}}
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|right|upright|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin.]]
Described as a cleaning action or ''Sauberung'',&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.366&lt;/ref&gt; [[book burnings]], known as the ''Bücherverbrennung'' in Germany, and sometimes referred to as the "[[bibliocaust]]", began on May 10, 1933, when the Association of German Students confiscated some 25,000 books from the [[Institute for Sexual Research]] and several captured Jewish libraries, which were burned in [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]].&lt;ref name="Baez_209-210"&gt;Baez 2011, pp. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; Like a lit fuse, the bonfire triggered book burning in other cities all over Germany, including Frankfurt and Munich, where the burnings were part of an orchestrated program, including music and speeches.&lt;ref name="Baez_209-210"/&gt; "Political police groups like the SA, the SS, and the Gestapo unleashed a campaign of intimidation that often frightened people into burning their own books."&lt;ref&gt;Baez 2011, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

"The blind writer [[Helen Keller]] published an ''Open Letter to German Students:'' 'You may burn my books and the books of the best minds in Europe, but the ideas those books contain have passed through millions of channels and will go on.'"&lt;ref&gt;Baez 2011, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate Art exhibition===
Modern artworks were purged from German museums. Over 5,000 works were initially seized, including 1,052 by [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]], 759 by [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], 639 by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and 508 by [[Max Beckmann]], as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; These became the material for a defamatory exhibit, ''[[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Entartete Kunst]]'' ("Degenerate Art"), featuring over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums, that premiered in [[Munich]] on July 19, 1937, and remained on view until November 30 before travelling to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. In this exhibition, the artworks were deliberately presented in a disorderly manner, and accompanied by mocking labels. "To 'protect' them, children were not allowed in."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the ''Entartete Kunst'' exhibition, the ''[[:de:Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung|Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung]]'' (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial ''[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]'' (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, pp. 124-125"/&gt;

The Degenerate Art Exhibition included works by some of the great international names—[[Paul Klee]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]—along with famous German artists of the time such [[Max Beckmann]], [[Emil Nolde]], and [[Georg Grosz]]. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist", says [[Jonathan Petropoulos]], professor of European History at [[Claremont McKenna College]] and author of several books on art and politics in the Third Reich. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician—but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favor of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and [[Bolsheviks]], although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category—art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticized German soldiers, art that offended the honor of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled "the insanity room". The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticize the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors—three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24819441|title=Why Hitler put 'degenerate' art on show|first=Lucy|last=Burns|date=6 November 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BIOS.jpg|thumb|alt=R/V Atlantic Explorer at the BIOS dock.|R/V ''Atlantic Explorer'' at the dock.]]

The '''Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences''' (known as '''BIOS''') is an independent, non-profit marine science and education institute located in [[Ferry Reach]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], [[Bermuda]]. The Institute, founded in 1903 as the Bermuda Biological Station, hosts a full-time faculty of [[oceanographer]]s, [[biologist]]s, and [[environmental scientist]]s, graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 groups, and [[Road Scholar]] (formerly [[Elderhostel]]) groups. BIOS's strategic mid-[[Atlantic Ocean]] location has at its doorstep a diverse marine environment, with close proximity to [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] as well as [[coral reef]] and near shore habitats.

Prior to 5 September 2006, BIOS was known as the '''Bermuda Biological Station for Research''' (BBSR).

==History==
Founded in 1903 and incorporated in New York as a US not-for-profit institution in 1926, in its initial years BIOS was a seasonal field station for visiting zoologists and biologists to take advantage of Bermuda's diverse marine environment. After the Second World War, BIOS became a year-round research center, anchored by the establishment in 1954 of Hydrostation 'S': regular deep ocean observations of a single point in the ocean that continue today, creating the longest continuous oceanic database in the world. During the following few decades, increasing numbers of visiting scientists brought an increased emphasis on biological and geological studies.

Resident scientific programs strengthened in the 1980s as the institute became a key link in an international effort to describe and understand the ocean-atmosphere system. In 1998, BIOS established the International Center for Ocean and Human Health, considered the first of its kind to explore the ocean health/human health connection on a global scale. The Center for Integrated [[Ocean Observations]] was established in 1999 and uses new technologies to build on a century of marine research at the institute.

'''Other notable dates:''' 1978: Oceanic Flux Program begins, the longest record of deep ocean sediment-trap studies in the world. 1988: [[Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study]] (BATS) begins, establishing BIOS as one of two US centers for [[time-series]] studies on temporal variability in the ocean and providing key data on changing climate and the ocean. 1994: Risk Prediction Initiative, a collaboration between climate scientists and reinsurers, is established.

==Notable visitors==
Summers from 1928 to 1939, oceanographic explorer [[William Beebe]] worked in [[Bermuda]].  During those years, Beebe visited BIOS (then the Bermuda Biological Station for Research) and worked with BIOS staff.  While Beebe is best remembered for his [[Bathysphere]] dives at Nonsuch Island, he made a number of other significant scientific contributions during his stay, mainly the discovery of new species of marine life.

==Research programs==
BIOS has a range of research programs investigating the role of the ocean in global climate, the health of coral reefs, and the connection between healthy oceans and healthy people. The geographical range is not restricted to the waters around Bermuda, but also extends to the [[Arctic]], the [[Antarctic]] and the [[tropics]]. '''The Center for Integrated Ocean Observations''' program is an international collaboration of oceanographers and climate scientists. Taking advantage of Bermuda's unique position, their goal is to better understand the biological, chemical and physical processes that take place in the ocean and the ocean's role in regulating the Earth's climate. '''The International Center for Ocean and Human Health''' is designed to address both health of the ocean (such as pollution threats) and health from the ocean (including nutrients and pharmaceutical applications). Working with experts on [[ocean acidification]], [[coral reefs]], [[ecotoxicology]], [[algae fuel|algal biofuel]], and the [[carbon cycle]]. '''The Risk Prediction Initiative (RPI)'''  program brings climate scientists and insurers together to collaborate to identify new directions for climate research. Matching the Institute's unique research ability with Bermuda's [[reinsurance|insurance]] market, this business-science partnership provides rapid, current and comprehensive information to those parts of the business community affected by environmental change.

==Research vessel==
[[File:CTD JCaison.jpg|thumb|alt=Preparing the CTD for deployment.|Preparing the CTD for deployment from the R/V ''Atlantic Explorer'']]The '''[[RV Atlantic Explorer|R/V Atlantic Explorer]]''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and BIOS.  It operates in compliance with [[United States Coast Guard]], [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System]] (UNOLS) and [[American Bureau of Shipping]] (ABS) rules and regulations.

The 168&amp;nbsp;ft Atlantic Explorer is equipped with navigation, laboratory and mechanical systems and equipment to support biological, geological, chemical and physical oceanographic research. Deploying and recovering deep ocean instrumentation [[Mooring (oceanography)|moorings]], conducting [[Conductivity, temperature, depth|CTD casts]], chemical sampling, and gear testing are among the number of operations within the ship's capabilities.

Ready access of two hours or more from Bermuda to the deep ocean makes the Atlantic Explorer useful for both short and extended cruises, for repetitive sampling and time-series research, and for projects requiring analytical and other sophisticated shore facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Delbard''' is a [[plant nursery]] in [[France]] known for breeding disease resistant [[apple]] and various [[rose]]s.&lt;ref name =tent&gt;[http://nztentation.com/about.php Tentation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Good&gt;[http://www.goodfruit.com/breeder-focuses-on-resistance/ Good Fruits]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rosa 'Dioressence' Delbard-Chabert 1984 RPO.jpg|thumb|'Dioressence', a rose cultivar developed by 'Delbard' in 1984.]]
Delbard Nursery was founded by and named after George Delbard, who was breeding fruit trees more than seventy years ago, at his family farm in the area of [[Malicorne, Allier]] in central France. Later on, he added roses, [[dahlia]]s, and other flowers to his breeding work. This business is continued and expanded by his grandson Arnaud Delbard, who is working close with the [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique]] which is a French governmental organization, as well as with other international collaboration for global [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;
[[File:Rosa Folle courtisane - Delbard 1988 Francia.JPG|thumb|'Folle courtisane' a cream rose cultivar developed by 'Delbar' in 1988.]]

==Apple breeding==

Delbard was first in France to create a breeding program for disease resistant [[apple cultivars]],&lt;ref name=Good/&gt; located near [[Commentry]], France, it is called "Delbard Pepinieres International".&lt;ref name =world/&gt;

This is done internationally by screening selections and mutations of seedlings and variations of the domesticated apple, some of which have adapted to resist certain [[apple diseases]]. Another approach is to find the resistant genes in certain [[species]] of [[crab apple]] which is the ancestor of the domesticated apple, and to introduce those desired traits through [[backcrossing]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

Altogether, the apples still needs to taste good as well, so this involves years of experiments, tasting and testing to provide a good apple for the consumer, which should be disease resistant and of good flavor, texture and looks.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

Jean-Paul Reynoird, Delbard’s research director says, that only about twenty selections out of 2,000 hybrids initiated, will make it till the end. Delbard has a separate program for [[pear]] breeding, aiming to combat [[fireblight]].&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;
[[File:Malus Delbard Jubilée 4497.jpg|thumb|[[Delbard Jubilee]] is an [[apple cultivars|apple cultivar]] developed by Delbard.]]
One of the very special apple cultivars developed by Delbard is the [[Tentation apple]] also called Dellblush&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyshs.org/pdf/fq/2005-Volume-13/Vol-13-No-1/Recent-Advances-in-Apple-Breeding,-Genetics-and-New-Cultivars.pdf Recent advances in Apple Breeding]&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited for cultivation to [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name =tent/&gt; [[Delbard Jubilee]] and [[Delbarestivale]] which has excellent taste in Southern [[Indiana, USA]] for
a mid season apple.&lt;ref name =world&gt;[http://evercrispapple.com/_PDF/_Newsletters/2002newsletter.pdf Apple Breeding Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissue culture==

Tissue culture started at Delbard in the early '80s when they began to use fragments of stems and green tissue of certified virus-free mother stock to grow plant material [[in vitro]]. The [[cloning|clonal]] modern approach, is still under the classification of [[vegetative propagation]], hence reproducing [[true to type]]. This is used for fruits as well as for flower and roses. In the fruit tree department which itself is producing 300,000 trees annually, two thirds are sold at the retail garden centers directly to the private customers, usually in [[bonsai]] containers or pots, and one third is sold for commercial growers. Plants sold for private user needs, which are carefully raised to perfection and already ready to fruit, are usually marked with a "W".&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

==Regenesis==
Delbard is utilizing to barn new technology called "[[regeneration (biology)|regenesis]]" which involves the use of [[irradiation]] to force [[mutation]]s from tissue culture material in vitro. Then they regenerate a bud from the irradiated cells. This is done with hope to change only a few undesirable characteristics of a plant and preserve its overall combination of traits.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

As of today this business is producing nursery stock material for commercial growers, as well as for forty retail garden centers. The nursery area covers six hundred hectares or about 1,500 acres, of sheltered [[greenhouse]]s and open field plantations.&lt;ref name=Good/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">The '''Diderot effect''' is a social phenomenon related to [[consumer goods]] that comprises two ideas. The first posits that goods purchased by consumers will be cohesive to their sense of identity, and as a result, will be complementary to one another. The second states that the introduction of a new possession that is deviant from the consumer's current complementary goods can result in a process of spiraling consumption. The term was coined by [[anthropologist]] and scholar of consumption patterns [[Grant McCracken]] in 1988, and is named after the French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784), who first described the effect in an [[essay]].

The term has become common in discussions of [[sustainable consumption]] and [[green consumerism]], in regard to the process whereby a purchase or gift creates dissatisfaction with existing possessions and environment, provoking a potentially spiraling pattern of consumption with negative environmental, psychological and social impacts. 

==Origin==
The effect was first described in Diderot's essay "Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown". Here he tells how the gift of a beautiful scarlet dressing gown leads to unexpected results, eventually plunging him into debt. Initially pleased with the gift, Diderot came to rue his new garment. Compared to his elegant new dressing gown, the rest of his possessions began to seem tawdry and he became dissatisfied that they did not live up to the elegance and style of his new possession. He replaced his old straw chair, for example, with an armchair covered in Moroccan leather; his old desk was replaced with an expensive new writing table; his formerly beloved prints were replaced with more costly prints, and so on. "I was absolute master of my old dressing gown", Diderot writes, "but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain".

==Usage==
In McCracken's usage the Diderot effect is the result of the interaction between objects within "product complements", or "Diderot unities", and consumers. A Diderot unity is a group of objects that are considered to be culturally complementary, in relation to one another. For example, items of clothing, furniture, vehicles, etc. McCracken describes that a consumer is less likely to veer from a preferred Diderot unity in order to strive towards unity in appearance and representation of one's social role. However, it can also mean that if an object that is somehow deviant from the preferred Diderot unity is acquired, it may have the effect of causing the consumer to start subscribing to a completely different Diderot unity.

Sociologist and economist [[Juliet Schor]] uses the term in her best selling 1992 book ''The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need'' to describe processes of competitive, status-conscious consumption driven by dissatisfaction. Schor's 2005 essay "Learning Diderot’s Lesson: Stopping the Upward Creep of Desire" describes the effect in contemporary consumer culture in the context of its negative environmental consequences.

A "'''Doom painting'''" or "Doom" is a traditional English term for a wall-painting of the [[Last Judgment]] in a medieval church.  This is the moment in [[Christian eschatology]] when Christ judges souls to send them to either [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] or [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;"doom: A painting of the Last Judgment on the chancel arch of a medieval parish church."--E. Lucie-Smith, ''The Thames &amp; Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms'' (1984); p. 68.  The term remains capitalized, as the proper name of a specific incident more often than not.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subject was very commonly painted on a large scale on the western wall of churches, so it was viewed as people left the church, and the term is typically used of these, rather than depictions of the ''Last Judgement'' in other locations or media. Many examples survive as wall-paintings in medieval churches, most dating from around the 12th to 13th centuries, although the subject was common from the 1st millennium until (in countries remaining Catholic) the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Most dooms in English churches were destroyed by government authority during the [[English Reformation]].

The most famous of all Doom paintings, [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''The Last Judgment'' by Michelangelo]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]], painted in 1537 to 1541, comes at the end of the tradition, and is unusually sited on the east wall behind the altar.

==The term "Doom"==
Doom or "the Doom" was a specific term for the Last Judgement and first cited to c. 1200 by the [[OED]] ("doom", 6), a sense surviving in this artistic meaning and in phrases such as the "crack of doom" and the word "doomsday", the latter going back to [[Old English]].  The original OED in the late 19th century already described this sense of "doom" as "archaic", but it remains in use in descriptions of (mostly) British medieval churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "doom", 6; "doomsday"&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Purpose and iconography==
Dooms were encouraged by the early medieval Church as an instrument to highlight the contrasts between the reward of Heaven and the agony of Hell so as to guide Christians away from misbehaviour and sin. A Doom was usually positioned either on the rear (liturgical Western) wall, if that space was available, or at the front ([[Chancel#Chancel|Chancel]] end) of a church, often on the Chancel arch itself so that it would be constantly visible to worshippers as they faced the altar during services.

Although there are many different versions, the composition stays broadly the same. On the left side of a Doom painting (that is, on Christ's right hand) is Heaven, whilst on the right (Christ's left) is Hell. At the top of the image Jesus Christ sits in glory with his (proper - i.e. on the left to the viewer) right hand encouraging the saved up and his left hand pointing down to Hell for the damned.  Typically flanking him is the [[Virgin Mary]] on his right and [[John the Apostle]] on his left, sometimes with the twenty-four elders mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]] encircling the three of them. The angels blow trumpets to raise the dead for judgment. Commonly [[Michael (archangel)|the Archangel Michael]] is in the centre, with the [[Weighing scale|scales]] he will use to weigh the souls of humanity to see if individually they are fit for Heaven: one person is on one side of the scale while [[demon]]ic creatures that represent the sins committed by the person are on the other side of the scale. The creatures try to tip the scales in their favour while, in some versions of the painting, the Virgin Mary places a rosary next to the person she wishes to protect, or puts her hand on the scale to counterbalance the demons. In some other versions, while one of the saved enters Heaven, a demon tries to pull them in with the damned, while an [[Guardian Angel|angel]] fights the demon for the soul.

Those who are worthy are brought to the gates of Heaven, frequently represented by a castle with large walls built to keep out sinful impurities. This is most commonly depicted on the left hand side of Doom paintings. Groups of angels adorn the walls of Heaven celebrating the [[Salvation|saved]] as they approach Heaven's gates, where [[Saint Peter]] waits with his keys.

Those on the other side are deemed unworthy of Heaven, usually seized by demons and brought into the [[Hellmouth]], beyond which, mostly out of sight, lie the bowels of hell.

A decisive factor in the Doom or Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal [[works of mercy]] were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the [[works of mercy]] is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Chaldon in Surrey the west wall of the church has a painting of the Ladder of Salvation (a subject common in the Eastern Church but this is the only example in England). This painting dates from about 1200 and is 17.5 ft long and 11.21 ft high.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. E. (1960) ''What to See in a Country Church''. London: Phoenix House; pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Chaldon|church of Saints Peter and Paul]], Chaldon, (built before 1086 AD) contains a large wall painting of around 1170 depicting images of the ways of salvation and damnation and their result &lt;ref&gt;Executed in accordance with a scheme originating in the Eastern Orthodox Church, preserved to us in the 'Guide to Painting of the Greek Church,' as used by the monk-painters of the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] whose title is "The Ladder of the Salvation of the Human Soul and the Road to Heaven"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drought tolerance''' is the ability to which a [[plant]] maintains its biomass production during [[arid]] or [[drought]] conditions. Some plants are naturally adapted to dry conditions and are called ''[[Xerophyte|xerophytes]],'' surviving with protection mechanisms such as [[desiccation tolerance]], [[detoxification]], or repair of [[xylem]] embolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tardieu|first=François|last2=Simonneau|first2=Thierry|last3=Muller|first3=Bertrand|date=2018-04-29|title=The Physiological Basis of Drought Tolerance in Crop Plants: A Scenario-Dependent Probabilistic Approach|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=733–759|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants, specifically some crop varieties like corn, wheat, and rice, have become more tolerant to drought via [[Plant breeding|conventional breeding methods.]] More recently, methods of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineering]] drought tolerant plants have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Honghong|last2=Xiong|first2=Lizhong|date=2014-04-29|title=Genetic Engineering and Breeding of Drought-Resistant Crops|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-040000?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=65|issue=1|pages=715–741|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-040000|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms behind drought tolerance are complex and involve many pathways which allows plants to respond to specific sets of conditions at any given time. Some of these interactions include [[stomatal conductance]], [[carotenoid]] degradation and [[anthocyanin]] accumulation, the intervention of [[Osmoprotectant|osmoprotectants]] (such as [[sucrose]], [[glycine]], and [[proline]]), [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]]-scavenging enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varshney|first=Rajeev K|last2=Tuberosa|first2=Roberto|last3=Tardieu|first3=Francois|date=2018-06-08|title=Progress in understanding drought tolerance: from alleles to cropping systems|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5991209/|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=69|issue=13|pages=3175–3179|doi=10.1093/jxb/ery187|issn=0022-0957|pmc=5991209|pmid=29878257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular control of drought tolerance is also very complex and is influenced other factors such as environment and the [[Plant development|developmental stage]] of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/32/default.asp|title=Biotechnology for the Development of Drought Tolerant Crops - Pocket K {{!}} ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This control consists mainly of transcriptional factors, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), [[abscisic acid]] (ABA)- responsive element-binding factor (AREB), and NAM (no apical meristem). 


== Physiology of drought tolerance ==
Plants can be subjected to slowly developing water shortages (ie, taking days, weeks, or months), or they may face short-term deficits of water) (ie, hours to days). In these situations, plants adapt by responding accordingly, minimizing water loss and maximizing water uptake. Plants are more susceptible to drought stress during the reproductive stages of growth, flowering and seed development. Therefore, the combination of short-term plus long-term responses allow for plants to produce a few viable seeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tardieu|first=François|last2=Simonneau|first2=Thierry|last3=Muller|first3=Bertrand|date=2018-04-29|title=The Physiological Basis of Drought Tolerance in Crop Plants: A Scenario-Dependent Probabilistic Approach|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=733–759|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of short-term and long-term physiological responses include:

=== Short-term responses ===

* In the leaf: root-signal recognition, stomatal closure, decreased carbon assimilation
* In the stem: inhibition of growth
* In the xylem: hydraulic changes, signal transport, assimilation of transport
* In the root: cell-drought signalling, osmotic adjustment

=== Long-term responses ===

* In the above-ground portion of the plant: inhibition of shoot growth, reduced transpiration area, grain abortion, senescence, metabolic acclimation, osmotic adjustment
* In the below-ground portion of the plant: turgor maintenance, sustained root growth, increased root/shoot, increased absorption area

&lt;br /&gt;
==Adaptations to dry conditions==
{{main|Xerophyte}}
Drought tolerant plants typically make use of either [[C4 carbon fixation]] or [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]] during [[photosynthesis]]. Both are improvements over the more common but more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] pathway in that they are more energy efficient. CAM is particularly good for arid conditions because [[carbon dioxide]] can be taken up at night, allowing the [[stoma]]ta to stay closed during the heat of the day and thus reducing water loss.&lt;ref name=botany_online&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e24/24b.htm Botany online: Photosynthesis - C3, C4 and CAM. Regulation of The Activity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717231237/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e24/24b.htm |date=July 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many adaptations for dry conditions are structural, including the following:
*Adaptations of the [[stoma]]ta to reduce water loss, such as reduced numbers or waxy surfaces.
*Water storage in [[succulent plant|succulent]] above-ground parts or water-filled [[tuber]]s.
*Adaptations in the [[root]] system to increase [[water absorption]].
*[[Trichome]]s (small hairs) on the [[leaf|leaves]] to absorb atmospheric water.

==Importance for agriculture==
Arid conditions can lower the [[crop yield|yield]] of many [[crops]]. [[Plant breeding]] programs for improved yield during drought conditions have great economic importance, and these programs may be broad in scope. For example, one study on [[soybean]]s currently being conducted by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] is scheduled to span several years, with research taking place across that country, and has among its goals the identification of specific mechanism by which soybeans resist [[wilting]] and of the specific [[gene]]s for drought tolerance.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?accn_no=409278 ARS Project: Drought Stress Tolerance for the Midwest and South; Soybean Variety Improvement (Continuation) (409278)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in horticulture==
In landscapes in arid or drought-prone regions, drought tolerance is an important consideration in plant selection. [[Xeriscaping]] is an approach to landscaping first developed in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], a region with hot, dry summers. The use of drought tolerant plants is essential to a successful xeriscape, which ideally requires no supplemental [[irrigation]].

[[File:CYP2C9 1OG2.png|230px|thumb|[[Cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s are important enzymes in [[xenobiotic]] metabolism.]]
'''Drug metabolism''' is the [[metabolism|metabolic breakdown]] of [[drug]]s by living [[organism]]s, usually through specialized [[enzyme|enzymatic]] systems. More generally, '''xenobiotic metabolism''' (from the Greek [[xenos (Greek)|xenos]] "stranger"  and biotic "related to living beings") is the set of [[metabolic pathway]]s that modify the chemical structure of [[xenobiotic]]s, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as any [[drug]] or [[poison]]. These pathways are a form of [[biotransformation]] present in all major groups of organisms, and are considered to be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to [[detoxification|detoxify]] poisonous compounds (although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects). The study of drug metabolism is called [[pharmacokinetics]].

The metabolism of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s is an important aspect of [[pharmacology]] and [[medicine]]. For example, the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug's pharmacologic action. Drug metabolism also affects [[multidrug resistance]] in [[infectious disease]]s and in [[chemotherapy]] for [[cancer]], and the actions of some drugs as [[substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous [[drug interaction]]s. These pathways are also important in [[environmental science]], with the xenobiotic metabolism of [[microorganism]]s determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during [[bioremediation]], or [[persistent organic pollutant|persist]] in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly the [[glutathione S-transferase]]s are also important in agriculture, since they may produce resistance to [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s.

Drug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics. These modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II reactions. These reactions are catalysed by [[transferase]] enzymes such as [[glutathione S-transferase]]s. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics may be further processed, before being recognised by [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux transporters]] and pumped out of cells. Drug metabolism often converts [[lipophilic]] compounds into [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] products that are more readily [[excretion|excreted]].

== Permeability barriers and detoxification ==

The exact compounds an organism is exposed to will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of xenobiotic toxic stress.&lt;ref name=Jakoby/&gt; The major challenge faced by xenobiotic detoxification systems is that they must be able to remove the almost-limitless number of xenobiotic compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal [[metabolism]]. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity [[enzyme|enzymatic]] systems.

All organisms use [[cell membrane]]s as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control access to their internal environment. Polar compounds cannot diffuse across these [[cell membrane]]s, and the uptake of useful molecules is mediated through [[transport protein]]s that specifically select substrates from the extracellular mixture. This selective uptake means that most [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] molecules cannot enter cells, since they are not recognised by any specific transporters.&lt;ref name="pmid12869659"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno N, Niwa T, Yotsumoto Y, Sugiyama Y | title = Impact of drug transporter studies on drug discovery and development | journal = Pharmacol. Rev. | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–61 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 12869659 | doi = 10.1124/pr.55.3.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the diffusion of [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] compounds across these barriers cannot be controlled, and organisms, therefore, cannot exclude [[lipid]]-soluble xenobiotics using membrane barriers.

However, the existence of a permeability barrier means that organisms were able to evolve detoxification systems that exploit the hydrophobicity common to membrane-permeable xenobiotics. These systems therefore solve the specificity problem by possessing such broad substrate specificities that they metabolise almost any non-polar compound.&lt;ref name=Jakoby/&gt; Useful metabolites are excluded since they are polar, and in general contain one or more charged groups.

The detoxification of the reactive by-products of normal metabolism cannot be achieved by the systems outlined above, because these species are derived from normal cellular constituents and usually share their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, specific enzymes can recognize and remove them. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the [[glyoxalase system]], which removes the reactive [[aldehyde]] methylglyoxal,&lt;ref name="pmid2198020"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thornalley PJ | title = The glyoxalase system: new developments towards functional characterization of a metabolic pathway fundamental to biological life | journal = Biochem.

== {{anchor|Phases}} Phases of detoxification ==

[[File:Xenobiotic metabolism.png|thumb|350px|right|Phases I and II of the metabolism of a lipophilic xenobiotic.]]
The metabolism of xenobiotics is often divided into three phases:- modification, conjugation, and excretion. These reactions act in concert to detoxify xenobiotics and remove them from cells.

=== Phase I – modification ===

In phase I, a variety of enzymes act to introduce reactive and polar groups into their substrates. One of the most common modifications is hydroxylation catalysed by the [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidase system]]. These enzyme complexes act to incorporate an atom of oxygen into nonactivated hydrocarbons, which can result in either the introduction of hydroxyl groups or N-, O- and S-dealkylation of substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid11409933"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guengerich FP | title = Common and uncommon cytochrome P450 reactions related to metabolism and chemical toxicity | journal = Chem. Res. Toxicol. | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 611–50 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11409933 | doi = 10.1021/tx0002583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction mechanism of the P-450 oxidases proceeds through the reduction of cytochrome-bound oxygen and the generation of a highly-reactive oxyferryl species, according to the following scheme:&lt;ref name="pmid10698731"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schlichting I, Berendzen J, Chu K, Stock AM, Maves SA, Benson DE, Sweet RM, Ringe D, Petsko GA, Sligar SG | title = The catalytic pathway of cytochrome p450cam at atomic resolution | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5458 | pages = 1615–22 |date=March 2000 | pmid = 10698731 | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5458.1615 | bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1615S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NADPH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + RH → NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ROH

Phase I reactions (also termed nonsynthetic reactions) may occur by [[oxidation]], [[Redox|reduction]], [[hydrolysis]], [[cyclization]], [[decyclization]], and addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, carried out by mixed function oxidases, often in the liver. These oxidative reactions typically involve a [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] monooxygenase (often abbreviated CYP), NADPH and oxygen. The classes of pharmaceutical drugs that utilize this method for their metabolism include [[phenothiazine]]s, [[Paracetamol#Metabolism|paracetamol]], and steroids. If the metabolites of phase I reactions are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted at this point. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an [[endogenous]] [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly [[polar conjugate]].

A common Phase I oxidation involves conversion of a C-H bond to a C-OH. This reaction sometimes converts a pharmacologically inactive compound (a [[prodrug]]) to a pharmacologically active one. By the same token, Phase I can turn a nontoxic molecule into a poisonous one ([[toxification]]). Simple hydrolysis in the stomach is normally an innocuous reaction, however there are exceptions. For example, phase I metabolism converts [[acetonitrile]] to HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, which rapidly dissociates into [[formaldehyde]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc154.htm|title=Acetonitrile (EHC 154, 1993)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I metabolism of drug candidates can be simulated in the laboratory using non-enzyme catalysts.&lt;ref name="pmid19039354"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akagah B, Lormier AT, Fournet A, Figadère B | title = Oxidation of antiparasitic 2-substituted quinolines using metalloporphyrin catalysts: scale-up of a biomimetic reaction for metabolite production of drug candidates | journal = Org. Biomol. Chem. | volume = 6 | issue = 24 | pages = 4494–7 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 19039354 | doi = 10.1039/b815963g }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example of a [[biomimetic]] reaction tends to give products that often contains the Phase I metabolites. As an example, the major metabolite of the pharmaceutical [[trimebutine]], desmethyltrimebutine (nor-trimebutine), can be efficiently produced by in vitro oxidation of the commercially available drug.  Hydroxylation of an N-methyl group leads to expulsion of a molecule of [[formaldehyde]], while oxidation of the O-methyl groups takes place to a lesser extent.

==== Oxidation ====

* [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]]
* [[Flavin-containing monooxygenase system]]
* [[Alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]]
* [[Monoamine oxidase]]
* Co-oxidation by [[peroxidase]]s

==== Reduction ====

* [[Cytochrome P450 reductase|NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase]]
Cytochrome P450 reductase, also known as NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:hemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase, P450 reductase, POR, CPR, CYPOR, is a membrane-bound enzyme required for electron transfer to cytochrome P450 in the microsome of the eukaryotic cell from a FAD- and FMN-containing enzyme NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase
The general scheme of electron flow in the POR/P450 system is:
NADPH	
→
FAD
→
FMN
→
P450
→
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Cytochrome P450 reductase|Reduced (ferrous) cytochrome P450]]

During reduction reactions, a chemical can enter ''futile cycling'', in which it gains a free-radical electron, then promptly loses it to [[oxygen]] (to form a [[superoxide anion]]).

==== Hydrolysis ====

* [[Esterase]]s and [[amidase]]
* [[Epoxide hydrolase]]

=== Phase II – conjugation {{anchor|Conjugation}} ===

In subsequent phase II reactions, these activated xenobiotic metabolites are [[Biotransformation#Phase .D0.86 reaction|conjugated]] with charged species such as [[glutathione]] (GSH), [[sulfate]], [[glycine]], or [[glucuronic acid]]. Sites on drugs where conjugation reactions occur include [[carboxyl]] (-COOH), [[hydroxyl]] (-OH), [[amino]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sulfhydryl]] (-SH) groups. Products of conjugation reactions have increased  molecular weight and tend to be less active than their substrates, unlike Phase I reactions which often produce [[active metabolites]]. The addition of large anionic groups (such as GSH) detoxifies reactive [[electrophile]]s and produces more polar metabolites that cannot diffuse across membranes, and may, therefore, be actively transported.

These reactions are catalysed by a large group of broad-specificity transferases, which in combination can metabolise almost any hydrophobic compound that contains nucleophilic or electrophilic groups.&lt;ref name=Jakoby&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakoby WB, Ziegler DM | title = The enzymes of detoxication | journal = J.

=== Phase III – further modification and excretion ===

After phase II reactions, the xenobiotic conjugates may be further metabolised. A common example is the processing of glutathione conjugates to [[acetylcysteine]] (mercapturic acid) conjugates.&lt;ref name="pmid4892500"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyland E, Chasseaud LF | title = The role of glutathione and glutathione S-transferases in mercapturic acid biosynthesis | journal = Adv.

In the final step, the [[cystine]] residue in the conjugate is [[acetylated]].

Conjugates and their metabolites can be excreted from cells in phase III of their metabolism, with the anionic groups acting as affinity tags for a variety of membrane transporters of the [[P-glycoprotein|multidrug resistance protein]] (MRP) family.&lt;ref name="pmid12897433"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Homolya L, Váradi A, Sarkadi B | title = Multidrug resistance-associated proteins: Export pumps for conjugates with glutathione, glucuronate or sulfate | journal = BioFactors | volume = 17 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 103–14 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12897433 | doi = 10.1002/biof.5520170111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are members of the family of [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]]s and can catalyse the ATP-dependent transport of a huge variety of hydrophobic anions,&lt;ref name="pmid10581368"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=König J, Nies AT, Cui Y, Leier I, Keppler D | title = Conjugate export pumps of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family: localization, substrate specificity, and MRP2-mediated drug resistance | journal = Biochim.

== Endogenous toxins ==

The detoxification of endogenous reactive metabolites such as [[peroxide]]s and reactive [[aldehyde]]s often cannot be achieved by the system described above. This is the result of these species' being derived from normal cellular constituents and usually sharing their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, it is possible for enzymatic systems to utilize specific molecular recognition to recognize and remove them. The similarity of these molecules to useful metabolites therefore means that different detoxification enzymes are usually required for the metabolism of each group of endogenous toxins. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the [[glyoxalase system]], which acts to dispose of the reactive aldehyde [[methylglyoxal]], and the various [[antioxidant]] systems that remove [[reactive oxygen species]].

== Sites ==

Quantitatively, the [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] of the [[liver]] cell is the principal organ of drug metabolism, although every [[biological tissue]] has some ability to metabolize drugs.
Factors responsible for the liver's contribution to drug metabolism include that it is a large organ, that it is the first organ perfused by chemicals absorbed in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], and that there are very high concentrations of most drug-metabolizing enzyme systems relative to other organs.
If a drug is taken into the GI tract, where it enters hepatic circulation through the portal vein, it becomes well-metabolized and is said to show the ''[[first pass effect]]''.

Other sites of drug metabolism include [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[lung]]s, [[kidney]]s, and the [[skin]].
These sites are usually responsible for localized toxicity reactions.

== Factors that affect drug metabolism ==

The duration and intensity of pharmacological action of most lipophilic drugs are determined by the rate they are metabolized to inactive products.
The [[Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]] is the most important pathway in this regard.
In general, anything that ''increases'' the rate of metabolism (''e.g.'', [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme induction]]) of a pharmacologically active metabolite will ''decrease'' the duration and intensity of the drug action.
The opposite is also true (''e.g.'', [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme inhibition]]). However, in cases where an enzyme is responsible for metabolizing a pro-drug into a drug, enzyme induction can speed up this conversion and increase drug levels, potentially causing toxicity.

Various ''physiological'' and ''pathological'' factors can also affect drug metabolism.
Physiological factors that can influence drug metabolism include age, individual variation (''e.g.'', [[pharmacogenetics]]), [[enterohepatic circulation]], [[nutrition]], [[intestinal flora]], or [[sex difference]]s.

In general, drugs are metabolized more slowly in [[fetal]], [[neonatal]] and [[elderly]] [[human]]s and [[animal]]s than in [[adult]]s.

Genetic variation ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) accounts for some of the variability in the effect of drugs.
With N-acetyltransferases (involved in ''Phase II'' reactions), individual variation creates a group of people who acetylate slowly (''slow acetylators'') and those who acetylate quickly, split roughly 50:50 in the population of [[Canada]].
This variation may have dramatic consequences, as the [[slow acetylators]] are more prone to dose-dependent toxicity.

[[Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]] enzymes can also vary across individuals, with deficiencies occurring in 1 – 30% of people, depending on their ethnic background.

Dose, frequency, route of administration, tissue distribution and protein binding of the drug affect its metabolism.

''Pathological factors'' can also influence drug metabolism, including [[liver]], [[kidney]], or [[heart]] diseases.

''In silico'' modelling and simulation methods allow drug metabolism to be predicted in virtual patient populations prior to performing clinical studies in human subjects.&lt;ref name="pmid17268485"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rostami-Hodjegan A, Tucker GT | title = Simulation and prediction of in vivo drug metabolism in human populations from ''in vitro'' data | journal = Nat Rev Drug Discov | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–8 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17268485 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used to identify individuals most at risk from adverse reaction.

== History ==

Studies on how people transform the substances that they ingest began in the mid-nineteenth century, with chemists discovering that organic chemicals such as [[benzaldehyde]] could be oxidized and conjugated to amino acids in the human body.&lt;ref name="pmid11353742"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murphy PJ | title = Xenobiotic metabolism: a look from the past to the future | journal = Drug Metab.

In the early twentieth century, work moved on to the investigation of the enzymes and pathways that were responsible for the production of these metabolites. This field became defined as a separate area of study with the publication by [[Richard Tecwyn Williams|Richard Williams]] of the book ''Detoxication mechanisms'' in 1947.&lt;ref name="pmid6347595"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neuberger A, Smith RL | title = Richard Tecwyn Williams: the man, his work, his impact | journal = Drug Metab.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11269">'''Ecological forecasting''' uses knowledge of physics, ecology and physiology to predict how ecological [[Population|populations]], [[Community (ecology)|communities]], or [[ecosystem]]s will change in the future in response to environmental factors such as [[climate change]]. The ultimate goal of the approach is to provide people such as resource managers and designers of [[marine reserve]]s with information that they can then use to respond, in advance, to future changes,&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"&gt;Clark et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[adaptation to global warming]].

One of the most important environmental factors for organisms today is [[global warming]].  Most physiological processes are affected by [[temperature]], and so even small changes in [[weather]] and [[climate]] can lead to large changes in the growth, reproduction and survival of animals and plants.  The [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Joint science academies' statement: The science of climate change |url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13619 |quote=The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |date=2001-05-17 |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000125/http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13619 |archivedate=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=2007-10-18 | title=Rising to the climate challenge | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=449 | issue=7164 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/full/449755a.html | accessdate=2007-11-06 | pages=755 | doi=10.1038/449755a | pmid=17943093}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity caused most of the warming observed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial era]]. These changes are in turn affecting human and natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;CCSP 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One major challenge is to predict where, when and with what magnitude changes are likely to occur so that we can mitigate or at least prepare for them.&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"/&gt; Ecological forecasting applies existing knowledge of how animals and plants interact with their physical environment&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006"&gt;Kearney 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to ask how changes in  environmental factors might result in changes to the ecosystems as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wethey and Woodin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Ecological forecasting varies in spatial and temporal extent, as well as in what is being forecast (presence, abundance, diversity, production, etc.).

* Population models may be used to generate short-term abundance forecasts using knowledge of [[population dynamics]] and recent environmental conditions. These models are used especially in [[Population dynamics of fisheries|fisheries]] and [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|disease]] forecasting. 
* [[Environmental niche modelling|Species distribution models]] (SDMs) may be used to forecast [[species distribution]] (presence or abundance) over longer ecological time scales using information about past and projected environmental conditions across the landscape.
** Correlative SDMs, also known as climate envelope models, rely on statistical correlations between existing species distributions (range boundaries) and environmental variables to outline a range (envelope) of environmental conditions within which a species can exist.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;Pearson and Dawson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elith|first=Jane|last2=Leathwick|first2=John R.|date=2009|title=Species Distribution Models: Ecological Explanation and Prediction Across Space and Time|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=677–697|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New range boundaries can then be forecast using future levels of environmental factors such as [[temperature]], [[rainfall]], and [[salinity]] from climate model projections. These methods are good for examining large numbers of species, but are likely not a good means of predicting effects at fine scales.
** Mechanistic SDMs use information about a species' physiological tolerances and constraints, as well as models of organismal body temperature and other biophysical properties, to define the range of environmental conditions within which a species can exist. These tolerances are mapped onto current and projected environmental conditions in the landscape to outline current and forecasted ranges for the species.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to "climate envelope" approaches, mechanistic SDMs model the fundamental niche directly, and are therefore much more exact.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006" /&gt;  However, the approach requires more information is also usually more time consuming.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;
*Other types of models may be used to forecast (or hindcast) biodiversity over evolutionary time scales. Palaeobiology modeling uses fossil and phylogenetic evidence of biodiversity in the past to project the trajectory of biodiversity in the future. Simple plots can be constructed and then adjusted based on the varying quality of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sahney, S.|author2=Benton, M.J.|author3=Ferry, P.A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forecasting examples==

===Biodiversity===
Using fossil evidence, studies have shown that vertebrate biodiversity has grown exponentially through Earth's history and that biodiversity is entwined with the diversity of Earth's habitats. 
{{quote|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence biodiversity will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."|Sahney ''et al''.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5405">'''Environmental biotechnology''' is [[biotechnology]] that is applied to and used to study the [[natural environment]].  Environmental biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation.  The [http://www3.inecol.edu.mx/iseb/ International Society for Environmental Biotechnology] defines environmental biotechnology as "the development, use and regulation of biological systems for remediation of contaminated environments ([[landform|land]], [[air]], [[water]]), and for [[natural environment|environment]]-friendly processes (green manufacturing technologies and [[sustainable development]])".&lt;ref&gt;Gerben J Zylstraa and Jerome J Kukor, ''What is environmental biotechnology?'' Current Opinion in Biotechnology 16(3):243-245, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental biotechnology can simply be described as "the optimal use of nature, in the form of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[algae]], to produce [[renewable energy]], [[food]] and [[nutrients]] in a [[synergistic]] integrated cycle of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] making processes where the waste of each process becomes the feedstock for another process".&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Sagar.

[[Science]] through the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development|IAASTD]] has called for the advancement of small-scale agro-ecological farming systems and technology in order to achieve food security, [[climate change mitigation]], [[climate change adaptation]] and the realisation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Environmental biotechnology has been shown to play a significant role in [[agroecology]] in the form of [[zero waste agriculture]] and most significantly through the operation of over 15 million [[biogas digester]]s worldwide.

==Significance towards industrial biotechnology==

Consider an environment in which pollution of a particular type is maximum. Let us consider the effluents of a starch industry  which has mixed up with a local water body like a lake or pond.  We find huge deposits of starch which are not so easily taken up for degradation by micro-organisms except for a few exemptions.  we isolate a few micro-organisms from the polluted site and scan for any significant changes in their genome like mutations or evolutions.  The modified genes are then identified.  This is done because, the isolate would have adapted itself to degrade/utilize the starch better than other microbes of the same genus.  Thus, the resultant genes are cloned onto industrially significant micro-organisms and are used for more economically significant processes like in pharmaceutical industry, fermentations...etc.

Similar situations can be elucitated like in the case of oil spills in the oceans which require cleanup, microbes isolated from oil rich environments like oil wells, oil transfer pipelines...etc. have been found having the potential to degrade oil or use it as an energy source.  Thus they serve as a remedy to oil spills.

Still another elucidation would be in the case of microbes isolated from pesticide rich soils These would be capable of utilizing the pesticides as energy source and hence when mixed along with bio-fertilizers, would serve as excellent insurance against increased pesticide-toxicity levels in agricultural platform.

But the counter argument would be that whether these newly introduced microorganisms would create an imbalance in the environment concerned.The mutual harmony in which the organisms in that particular environment existed may have to face alteration and we should be extremely careful so as to not disturb the mutual relationships already existing in the environment of both the benefits and the disadvantages would pave way for an improvised version of environmental biotechnology. After all it is the environment that we strive to protect.

==Applications and Implications==

Humans have been manipulating genetic material for centuries. Although many benefits are provided by these manipulations, there can also be unexpected, negative health and environmental outcomes. Environmental biotechnology, then, is all about the balance between the applications that provide for these and the implications of manipulating genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel A. Vallero]], ''Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach'', Academic Press, Amsterdam, NV; {{ISBN|978-0-12-375089-1}}; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Textbooks address both the applications and implications. Environmental engineering texts addressing [[sewage treatment]] and biological principles are often now considered to be environmental biotechnology texts. These generally address the applications of biotechnologies, whereas the implications of these technologies are less often addressed; usually in books concerned with potential impacts and even catastrophic events.

'''Epoxide docosapentaenoic acids''' ('''epoxydocosapentaenoic acids''', '''EDPs''', or '''EpDPEs''') are metabolites of the 22-carbon straight-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA).  Cell types that express certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) [[epoxygenase]]s metabolize [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]'s (PUFAs) by converting one of their double bonds to an [[epoxide]].  In the best known of these metabolic pathways, cellular CYP epoxygenases metabolize the 20-carbon straight-chain [[omega-6 fatty acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], to [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (EETs); another CYP epoxygenase pathway metabolizes the  20-carbon omega-3 fatty acid, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), to [[epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]s (EEQs). CYP epoxygenases similarly convert various other PUFAs to epoxides (see [[epoxygenase]]) These epoxide metabolites have a variety of activities.  However, essentially all of them are rapidly converted to their corresponding, but in general far less active, [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] dihydroxy fatty acids by ubiquitous cellular [[Soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH; also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2).  Consequently, these epoxides, including EDPs, operate as short-lived signaling agents that regulate the function of their parent or nearby cells.  The particular feature of EDPs (and EEQs) distinguishing them from EETs is that they derive from omega-3 fatty acids and are suggested to be responsible for some of the  beneficial effects attributed to omega-3 fatty acids and omega-3-rich foods such as [[fish oil]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
EDPs are [[epoxide]] eicosapentaenoic acid metabolites of DHA.  DHA has 6 cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) [[Double bond]]s each one of which is located between carbons 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, or 19-20. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack any one of these double bounds to form a respective docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) epoxide regioisomer (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)).  A given epoxygenase may therefore convert DHA to 4,5-EDP (i.e. 4,5-epoxy-7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 7,8-EDP (i.e. 7,8-epoxy-4''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 10,11-EDP (i.e. 10,11-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 13,14-EDP (i.e. 13,14-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 16,17-EDP (i.e. 16,17-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',19''Z''-DPA, or 19,20-EDP (i.e. 19,20-epoxy-4''Z'', 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-DPA. The epoxygenase enzymes generally form both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] at each former double bound position; for example, cytochrome P450 epoxidases attack DHA at the 16,17-double bond position to form two epoxide enantiomers, 16''R'',17''S''-EDP and 16''S'',17''S''-EDP.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25093613 | pmc = 4314516 | year = 2015 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Production==
Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily that are classified as epoxygenases based on their ability to metabolize PUFA, particularly arachidonic acid, to epoxides include: CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, CYP2J, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2J2]], and possibly [[CYP2S1]] [[isoforms]] appear to be the principal epoxygenases responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Production]]).  In general, these same CYP epoxygenases also metabolize DHA to EDP (as well as EPA to EEQ; CYP2S1 has not yet been tested for DHA-metabolizing ability), doing so at rates that are often greater than their rates in metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs; that is, DHA (and EPA) appear to be preferred over arachidonic acid as substrates for many of the CYP epoxygenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25330284 | year = 2015 | author1 = Frömel | first1 = T | title = Whatever happened to the epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid-like endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor?

H. | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the cited CYP's, [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F8]], [[CYP4F12]], [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], and [[CYP2E1]], which are classified as CYP monooxygenase rather than CYP epoxygeanses because they metablize arachidonic acid to monohydroxy eicosatetraenoic acids (see [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]), i.e. 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and/or 20-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid, take on epoxygease activity in converting DHA primarily to 19,20-EDP isomers (see [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]).&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011. p 16"/&gt; The CYP450 epoxygenases capable of metabolizing DHA to EDPs are wildly distributed in organs and tissues such as the liver, kidney, heart, lung, pancreas, intestine, blood vessels, blood leukocytes, and brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18952572 | pmc = 2674692 | year = 2009 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A. A. | title = Arachidonic acid cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway | journal = The Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 50 Suppl | pages = S52–6 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.R800038-JLR200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23865864 | year = 2013 | author1 = Xu | first1 = M | title = Cytochrome P450 2J2: Distribution, function, regulation, genetic polymorphisms and clinical significance | journal = Drug Metabolism Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–52 | last2 = Ju | first2 = W | last3 = Hao | first3 = H | last4 = Wang | first4 = G | last5 = Li | first5 = P | doi = 10.3109/03602532.2013.806537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tissues are known to metabolize arachidonic acid to EETs; it has been shown or is presumed that they also metabolize DHA to EPD's.

The EDPs are commonly made by the stimulation of specific cell types by the same mechanisms which produce EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]).  That is, cell stimulation causes DHA to be released from the ''sn-2'' position of their membrane-bound cellular [[phospholipid]] pools through the action of a [[Phospholipase A2]]-type enzyme and the subsequent attack of the released DHA by CYP450 epoxidases. It is notable that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans.  Indeed, this rise in EDP (and EEQ) levels in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids and, it is suggested, may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24634501 | pmc = 4031946 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fischer | first1 = R | title = Dietary omega-3 fatty acids modulate the eicosanoid profile in man primarily via the CYP-epoxygenase pathway | journal = The Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 1150–1164 | last2 = Konkel | first2 = A | last3 = Mehling | first3 = H | last4 = Blossey | first4 = K | last5 = Gapelyuk | first5 = A | last6 = Wessel | first6 = N | last7 = von Schacky | first7 = C | last8 = Dechend | first8 = R | last9 = Muller | first9 = D.

==EDP metabolism==
Similar to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), EDPs are rapidly metabolized in cells by a cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH, also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.10.]) to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids. Thus, sEH converts 19,20-EDP to 19,10-dihdroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DPA), 16,17-EDP to 16,17-dihydroxy-DPA, 13,14-EDP to 13,14-dihydroxy-DPA, 10,11-EDP to 10,11-dihydroxy-DPA, and 7,8-EDP to 7,8-dihydroxy-EDP; 4,5-EDP is unstable and therefore generally not detected in cells.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T. R. | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: Gene structure, expression and deletion | journal = Gene | volume = 526 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–74 | last2 = Hammock | first2 = B. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dihydroxy-EDP products, like their epoxy precursors, are [[enantiomer]] mixtures; for instance, sEH converts 16,17-EDP to a mixture of 16(''S''),17(''R'')-dihydroxy-DPA and 16(''R''),1y(''S'')-dihydroxy-DPA.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; These dihydroxy-DPAs typically are far less active than their epoxide precursors.  The sEH pathway acts rapidly and is by far the predominant pathway of EDP inactivation; its operation causes EDPs to function as short-lived mediators whose actions are limited to their parent and nearby cells, i.e. they are [[autocrine]] and [[paracrine]] signaling agents, respectively.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23011468 | year = 2013 | author1 = Bellien | first1 = J | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | last2 = Joannides | first2 = R | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26621325 | year = 2016 | author1 = He | first1 = J | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: A potential target for metabolic diseases | journal = Journal of Diabetes | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–13 | last2 = Wang | first2 = C | last3 = Zhu | first3 = Y | last4 = Ai | first4 = D | doi = 10.1111/1753-0407.12358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the sEH pathway, EDPs, similar to the EETs, may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction; this pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  Finally, again similar to the EETs, EDPs are subject to inactivation by being further metabolized b [[Beta oxidation]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2014.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
EDPs have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  This is particularly the case for animal studies into their potential clinical significance.  In comparison to a selection of the many activities attributed to the EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), animal studies reported to date find that certain EDPs (16,17-EDP and 19,20-EDP have been most often examined) are: '''1)''' more potent than EETs in decreasing hypertension and pain perception; '''2)''' more potent than or at least equal in potency to the EETs in suppressing inflammation; and '''3)''' act oppositely from the EETs in that EDPs inhibit [[angiogenesis]], endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and the growth and metastasis of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines whereas EETs have stimulatory effects in each of these systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt; As indicated in the Metabolism section, consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans and in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Hence, the metabolism of DHA to EDPs (and EPA to EEQs) may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="105714">'''Exoplanetology''', or '''exoplanetary science''', is an integrated field of astronomical science dedicated to the search for and study of [[exoplanet]]s (extrasolar planets). It employs an interdisciplinary approach which includes [[astrobiology]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrochemistry]], [[astrogeology]], [[geochemistry]], and [[planetary science]].

== Nomenclature ==
{{Main|Exoplanet naming convention}}
The exoplanet naming convention is an extension of the system used for naming multiple-star systems as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). For an exoplanet orbiting a single star, the name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" (the parent star is considered to be "a") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbit size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the naming of [[circumbinary planet]]s. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.

== Definition ==

=== IAU ===
The official [[Definition of planet|definition of "planet"]] used by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) only covers the [[Solar System]] and thus does not apply to exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes
|date=2006

|title=Why Planets Will Never Be Defined

|accessdate=13 February 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2011, the only defining statement issued by the IAU that pertains to exoplanets is a working definition issued in 2001 and modified in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|date=28 February 2003

|accessdate=23 November 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That definition contains the following criteria:

{{quote|
* Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
* Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarfs]]", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
* Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).
}}

=== Alternatives ===
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s working definition is not always used. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from [[brown dwarf]]s on the basis of formation.

== Detection methods ==
{{Main article|Methods of detecting extrasolar planets}}

=== Direct imaging ===

[[File:Beta Pictoris.jpg|thumb|alt=Two directly imaged exoplanets around star Beta Pictoris, star-subtracted and artificially embellished with an outline of the orbit of one of the planets. The white dot in the center is the other exoplanet in the same system.|Directly imaged planet [[Beta Pictoris b]]]]
Planets are extremely faint compared with their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star in order to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme [[optothermal stability]].&lt;ref name="Perryman_book11"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Perryman|first = Michael|title = The Exoplanet Handbook|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2011|page = 149|isbn = 978-0-521-76559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than [[Jupiter]]) and widely separated from their parent star.

Specially designed direct-imaging instruments such as [[Gemini Planet Imager]], [[VLT-SPHERE]], and [[Subaru Telescope#Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system|SCExAO]] will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods. The following are the indirect methods that have proven useful:

=== Indirect methods ===
* [[Transit method]]
:[[File:Dopspec-inline.gif|thumb|alt=Edge-on animation of a star-planet system, showing the geometry considered for the transit method of exoplanet detection|When the star is behind a planet, its brightness will seem to dim]]If a planet crosses (or [[Astronomical transit|transits]]) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' telescope]] uses this method.

:As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity—that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth—can be detected from displacements in the star's [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]].

* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Gravitational microlensing|Gravitational microlensing]]
:Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in the magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1–10&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] away from Sun-like stars.
* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|Astrometry]]
:Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.
* [[Pulsar timing]]
:A [[pulsar]] (the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a [[supernova]]) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses. [[PSR B1257+12|The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet]] was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.

:Disks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs starlight and re-emits it as [[infrared]] radiation. Features in the disks may suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive detection method.

== Orbital parameters ==
Most known extrasolar planet candidates have been discovered using indirect methods and therefore only some of their physical and orbital parameters can be determined. For example, out of the six independent [[orbital element|parameters]] that define an orbit, the radial-velocity method can determine four: [[semi-major axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], [[longitude of periastron]], and time of periastron.

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much further from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU), takes 88 days for an orbit, but the smallest known orbits of exoplanets have orbital periods of only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in smaller orbits than Mercury's. [[Neptune]] is 30&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit it, but there are exoplanets that are thousands of AU from their star and take tens of thousands of years to orbit, e.g. [[GU Piscium b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technology.org/2014/05/14/enlightening-pisces-star-signs-lead-scientists-discovery/ |title=Enlightening Pisces star signs lead scientists to discovery |publisher=technology.org |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Radial velocity|radial-velocity]] and [[Transit method|transit]] methods are most sensitive to planets with small orbits. The earliest discoveries such as [[51 Peg b]] were [[gas giant]]s with orbits of a few days.&lt;ref name="cumming08"&gt;{{Cite journal| year=2008| title=The Keck Planet Search: Detectability and the Minimum Mass and Orbital Period Distribution of Extrasolar Planets| journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific| volume=120| issue=867|pages=531–554| arxiv=0803.3357|doi=10.1086/588487| bibcode=2008PASP..120..531C| authorlink3=Debra Fischer |last1=Cumming| first1=Andrew|last2=Butler|first2=R.

The [[Kepler spacecraft|''Kepler'' space observatory]] has found planets with even shorter orbits of only a few hours, which places them within the star's upper atmosphere or [[corona]], and these planets are Earth-sized or smaller and are probably the left-over solid cores of giant planets that have evaporated due to being so close to the star,&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, Irene (15 August 2013) [http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/time-flies-on-these-kepler-planets-130815.htm "Time Really Flies on These Kepler Planets"]. News.discovery.com&lt;/ref&gt; or even being engulfed by the star in its red-giant phase in the case of [[Kepler-70b]]. As well as evaporation, other reasons why larger planets are unlikely to survive orbits only a few hours long include orbital decay caused by [[tidal force]], tidal-inflation instability, and [[Roche lobe|Roche-lobe]] overflow.&lt;ref name="roche limit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/773/1/L15|arxiv=1307.4080| title = The Roche limit for close-orbiting planets: Minimum density, composition constraints, and application to the 4.2 hr planet KOI 1843.03| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 773|issue=1| pages = L15| year = 2013| last1 = Rappaport | first1 = S. | last2 = Sanchis-Ojeda | first2 = R. | last3 = Rogers | first3 = L.

The [[direct imaging]] method is most sensitive to planets with large orbits, and has discovered some planets that have planet–star separations of hundreds of AU. However, protoplanetary disks are usually only around 100&amp;nbsp;AU in radius, and [[Nebular hypothesis#Giant planets|core accretion models]] predict giant planet formation to be within 10&amp;nbsp;AU, where the planets can coalesce quickly enough before the disk [[photoevaporation|evaporates]].

Most planets that have been discovered are within a couple of AU from their host star because the most used methods (radial-velocity and transit) require observation of several orbits to confirm that the planet exists and there has only been enough time since these methods were first used to cover small separations. Some planets with larger orbits have been discovered by direct imaging but there is a middle range of distances, roughly equivalent to the Solar System's gas giant region, which is largely unexplored. Direct imaging equipment for exploring that region was installed on two large telescopes that began operation in 2014, e.g. [[Gemini Planet Imager]] and [[VLT-SPHERE]]. The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#microlensing|microlensing]] method has detected a few planets in the 1–10&amp;nbsp;AU range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/?f=%22microlensing%22+IN+detection Catalog Listing]. Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt;
It appears plausible that in most exoplanetary systems, there are one or two giant planets with orbits comparable in size to those of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System. Giant planets with substantially larger orbits are now known to be rare, at least around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/717/2/878| title = A Uniform Analysis of 118 Stars with High-Contrast Imaging: Long-Period Extrasolar Giant Planets Are Rare Around Sun-Like Stars| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 717| issue = 2| pages = 878–896| year = 2010| last1 = Nielsen | first1 = E.

The distance of the [[#Habitability|habitable zone]] from a star depends on the type of star and this distance changes during the star's lifetime as the size and temperature of the star changes.

=== Eccentricity ===
The [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of an orbit is a measure of how elliptical (elongated) it is. All the planets of the Solar System except for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have near-circular orbits (e&lt;0.1).&lt;ref name="marcyprogth05"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most exoplanets with orbital periods of 20 days or less have near-circular orbits, i.e. very low eccentricity. That is thought to be due to [[tidal circularization]]: reduction of eccentricity over time due to gravitational interaction between two bodies. The mostly sub-Neptune-sized planets found by the ''Kepler'' spacecraft with short orbital periods have very circular orbits.&lt;ref name="kepler1700"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's Kepler Mission Announces a Planet Bonanza, 715 New Worlds |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-mission-announces-a-planet-bonanza/ |date=26 February 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the giant planets with longer orbital periods discovered by radial-velocity methods have quite eccentric orbits. (As of July 2010, 55% of such exoplanets have eccentricities greater than 0.2, whereas 17% have eccentricities greater than 0.5.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php|work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Moderate to high eccentricities (e&gt;0.2) of giant planets are ''not'' an observational selection effect, because a planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its orbit. The statistical significance of elliptical orbits in the ensemble of observed giant planets is somewhat surprising, because current theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] suggest that low-mass planets should have their [[orbital eccentricity]] circularized by gravitational interactions with the surrounding [[protoplanetary disk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Tanaka |first1=Hidekazu |title=Three-dimensional Interaction between a Planet and an Isothermal Gaseous Disk.

However, as a planet grows more massive and its interaction with the disk becomes nonlinear, it may induce eccentric motion of the surrounding disk's gas, which in turn may excite the planet's orbital eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0608355 |last1=D'Angelo |first1=Gennaro |title=Evolution of Giant Planets in Eccentric Disks |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=652 |issue=2 |pages=1698–1714 |last2= Lubow |first2=Stephen H. |last3= Bate |first3=Matthew R. |year=2006 |doi=10.1086/508451 |bibcode = 2006ApJ...652.1698D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1603.00653 |last1=Teyssandier |first1=Jean |title=Growth of eccentric modes in disc-planet interactions |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=458 |issue=3 |pages=3221–3247 |last2= Ogilvie |first2=Gordon I. |year=2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw521 |bibcode = 2016MNRAS.458.3221T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1603.02544 |last1=Barker |first1=Adrian J. |title=Nonlinear hydrodynamical evolution of eccentric Keplerian discs in two dimensions: validation of secular theory |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=458 |issue=4 |pages=3739–3751 |last2= Ogilvie |first2=Gordon I. |year=2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw580 |bibcode = 2016MNRAS.458.3739B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Low eccentricities are correlated with high multiplicity (number of planets in the system) based on the analysis of planets observed by the radial-velocity method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.1073/pnas.1406545111| title = The Exoplanet Orbital Eccentricity – Multiplicity Relation and the Solar System| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 112| issue = 1| pages = 20–24| year = 2015| last1 = Limbach | first1 = M.

For weak [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler]] signals near the limits of the current detection ability, the eccentricity becomes poorly constrained and biased towards higher values. It is suggested that some of the high eccentricities reported for low-mass exoplanets may be overestimates, because simulations show that many observations are also consistent with two planets on circular orbits. Reported observations of single planets in moderately eccentric orbits have about a 15% chance of being a pair of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/702/1/716| title = Which Radial Velocity Exoplanets Have Undetected Outer Companions?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 702| issue = 1| pages = 716–723| year = 2009| last1 = Rodigas | first1 = T.

With the exoplanet sample known in 2009, a group of astronomers estimated that "(1) around 35% of the published eccentric one-planet solutions are statistically indistinguishable from planetary systems in 2:1 orbital resonance, (2) another 40% cannot be statistically distinguished from a circular orbital solution" and "(3) planets with masses comparable to Earth could be hidden in known orbital solutions of eccentric super-Earths and Neptune mass planets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/709/1/168| title = How Eccentric Orbital Solutions Can Hide Planetary Systems in 2:1 Resonant Orbits| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 709| issue = 1| pages = 168–178| year = 2010| last1 = Anglada-Escudé | first1 = G. | last2 = López-Morales | first2 = M. | last3 = Chambers | first3 = J.

Radial velocity surveys found exoplanet orbits beyond 0.1 AU to be eccentric, particularly for large planets. Transit data obtained by the ''Kepler'' spacecraft, is consistent with the RV surveys and also revealed that smaller planets tend to have less eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1203.1631|bibcode = 2012MNRAS.425..757K |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21627.x | volume=425 |issue = 1 |title=The exoplanet eccentricity distribution from Kepler planet candidates |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |pages=757–762|year = 2012 |last1 = Kane |first1 = Stephen R. |last2 = Ciardi |first2 = David R. |last3 = Gelino |first3 = Dawn M. |last4 = von Braun |first4 = Kaspar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle ===
[[Orbital inclination]] is the angle between a planet's [[orbital plane]] and another plane of reference. For exoplanets, the inclination is usually stated with respect to an observer on Earth: the angle used is that between the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the planet's orbital plane and the line of sight from Earth to the star. Therefore, most planets observed by the [[transit method]] are close to 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, John (2008) ''Exoplanets: Detection, Formation, Properties, Habitability''.  Springer. {{ISBN|3-540-74007-4}}. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Because the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin–orbit angle or spin–orbit alignment. In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown. The ''Kepler'' spacecraft has found a few hundred multi-planet systems and in most of these systems the planets all orbit in nearly the same plane, much like the Solar System.&lt;ref name="kepler1700" /&gt; However, a combination of astrometric and radial-velocity measurements has shown that some planetary systems contain planets whose orbital planes are significantly tilted relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-tilt Out of Flatland: Orbits Are Askew in a Nearby Planetary System]. ''Scientific American''. 24 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of [[hot Jupiter]]s have orbital planes substantially misaligned with their parent star's rotation. A substantial fraction of hot-Jupiters even have [[retrograde orbit]]s, meaning that they orbit in the opposite direction from the star's rotation.&lt;ref name="2010question"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/nam2010/pr10.php |title=Turning planetary theory upside down |publisher=Astro.gla.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, it may be that the star itself flipped early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727765.200-tilting-stars-may-explain-backwards-planets.html "Tilting stars may explain backwards planets"], ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Vol. 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periastron precession ===
[[Apsidal precession|Periastron precession]] is the rotation of a planet's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. In the Solar System, perturbations from other planets are the main cause, but for close-in exoplanets the largest factor can be tidal forces between the star and planet. For close-in exoplanets, the [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contribution to the precession is also significant and can be orders of magnitude larger than the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|same effect for Mercury]]. Some exoplanets have significantly [[#Eccentricity|eccentric orbits]], which makes it easier to detect the precession. The effect of general relativity can be detectable in timescales of about 10 years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0806.0630| bibcode = 2008ApJ...685..543J |doi = 10.1086/590549 | volume=685| issue = 1 |title=Observability of the General Relativistic Precession of Periastra in Exoplanets|journal=The Astrophysical Journal| pages=543–552| year = 2008 |last1 = Jordán |first1 = Andrés |last2 = Bakos |first2 = Gáspár Á.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nodal precession ===
[[Nodal precession]] is rotation of a planet's orbital plane. Nodal precession is more easily seen as distinct from periastron precession when the orbital plane is [[inclination|inclined]] to the star's rotation, the extreme case being a polar orbit.

[[WASP-33]] is a fast-rotating star that hosts a [[hot Jupiter]] in an almost polar orbit. The [[Quadrupole#Gravitational quadrupole|quadrupole mass moment]] and the proper [[angular momentum]] of the star are 1900 and 400 times, respectively, larger than those of the Sun. This causes significant [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|classical]] and [[general relativity|relativistic]] deviations from [[Kepler's laws]]. In particular, the fast rotation causes large nodal precession because of the star's [[oblateness]] and the [[Lense–Thirring precession|Lense–Thirring effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1006.2707|doi = 10.1007/s10509-010-0468-x |bibcode = 2011Ap&amp;SS.331..485I | volume=331|issue = 2 |title=Classical and relativistic node precessional effects in WASP-33b and perspectives for detecting them| journal=Astrophysics and Space Science| pages=485–496| year = 2010 |last1 = Iorio |first1 = Lorenzo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of spin and tilt of terrestrial planets ===
[[Impact event|Giant impacts]] have a large effect on the spin of [[terrestrial planets]]. The last few giant impacts during [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] tend to be the main determiner of a terrestrial planet's rotation rate. On average the spin [[angular velocity]] will be about 70% of the velocity that would cause the planet to break up and fly apart; the natural outcome of [[planetary embryo]] impacts at speeds slightly larger than [[escape velocity]]. In later stages terrestrial planet spin is also affected by impacts with [[planetesimal]]s. During the giant impact stage, the thickness of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three-dimensions. This results in the [[axial tilt]] of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde and retrograde]] spins equally probable. Therefore, prograde spin with a small axial tilt, common for the Solar System's terrestrial planets except Venus, is not common in general for terrestrial planets built by giant impacts. The initial axial tilt of a planet determined by giant impacts can be substantially changed by stellar tides if the planet is close to its star and by satellite tides if the planet has a large satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |arxiv=1312.1689|bibcode = 2014prpl.conf..595R |doi = 10.2458/azu_uapress_9780816531240-ch026 | title=Terrestrial Planet Formation at Home and Abroad |journal=Protostars and Planets VI|page = 595 |year = 2014 |last1 = Raymond |first1 = S.

=== Tidal effects ===
For most planets, the rotation period and [[axial tilt]] (also called obliquity) are not known, but a large number of planets have been detected with very short orbits (where tidal effects are greater) that will probably have reached an [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] rotation that can be predicted (''i.e.'' [[tidally locked|tidal lock]], [[Mercury (planet)#Spin–orbit resonance|spin–orbit resonances]], and [[Retrograde and prograde motion#Planets|non-resonant equilibria such as retrograde rotation]]).&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

Gravitational tides tend to reduce the axial tilt to zero but over a longer timescale than the rotation rate reaches equilibrium. However, the presence of multiple planets in a system can cause axial tilt to be captured in a resonance called a [[Cassini state]]. There are small oscillations around this state and in the case of [[Mars]] these axial tilt variations are chaotic.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

[[Hot Jupiter]]s' close proximity to their host star means that their spin–orbit evolution is mostly due to the star's gravity and not the other effects. Hot Jupiters' rotation rate is not thought to be captured into spin–orbit resonance because of the way in which such a fluid-body reacts to tides; a planet like this therefore slows down into synchronous rotation if its orbit is circular, or, alternatively, it slows down into a non-synchronous rotation if its orbit is eccentric. Hot Jupiters are likely to evolve towards zero axial tilt even if they had been in a Cassini state during planetary migration when they were further from their star. Hot Jupiters' orbits will become more circular over time, however the presence of other planets in the system on eccentric orbits, even ones as small as Earth and as far away as the habitable zone, can continue to maintain the eccentricity of the Hot Jupiter so that the length of time for [[tidal circularization]] can be billions instead of millions of years.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

The rotation rate of planet [[HD 80606 b]] is predicted to be about 1.9 days.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt; HD 80606 b avoids spin–orbit resonance because it is a gas giant. The eccentricity of its orbit means that it avoids becoming tidally locked.

=== Mass ===
When a planet is found by the [[radial-velocity method]], its [[#Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle|orbital inclination]] ''i'' is unknown and can range from 0 to 90 degrees. The method is unable to determine the [[true mass]] (''M'') of the planet, but rather gives a [[minimum mass|lower limit for its mass]], ''M''&amp;nbsp;sin''i''. In a few cases an apparent exoplanet may be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or red dwarf. However, the probability of a small value of i (say less than 30 degrees, which would give a true mass at least double the observed lower limit) is relatively low (1−{{radic|3}}/2 ≈ 13%) and hence most planets will have true masses fairly close to the observed lower limit.&lt;ref name="cumming08" /&gt;

If a planet's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the line of vision (i.e. ''i'' close to 90°), a planet can be detected through the [[transit method]]. The inclination will then be known, and the inclination combined with ''M''&amp;nbsp;sin''i'' from radial-velocity observations will give the planet's true mass.

Also, [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations and dynamical considerations in multiple-planet systems can sometimes provide an upper limit to the planet's true mass.

The mass of a transiting exoplanet can also be determined from the transmission spectrum of its atmosphere, as it can be used to constrain independently the atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and [[scale height]].&lt;ref name="JulienSeager2013"&gt;{{cite journal| last=de Wit| first=Julien|author2=Seager, S.| title=Constraining Exoplanet Mass from Transmission Spectroscopy| journal=Science| date=19 December 2013| volume=342| issue=6165|pages=1473–1477| arxiv=1401.6181| doi=10.1126/science.1245450| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1473|pmid=24357312| bibcode = 2013Sci...342.1473D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transit-timing variation]] can also be used to find a planet's mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/592230| title = Mass and Orbit Determination from Transit Timing Variations of Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 688| issue = 1| pages = 636–646| year = 2008| last1 = Nesvorný | first1 = D. | last2 = Morbidelli | first2 = A. | bibcode=2008ApJ...688..636N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radius, density, and bulk composition ===
Prior to recent results from the ''Kepler'' space observatory, most confirmed planets were [[gas giant]]s comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they are most easily detected. However, the planets detected by ''Kepler'' are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.&lt;ref name="kepler1700" /&gt;

If a planet is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its true mass and its radius can be determined, as well as its [[density]]. Planets with low density are inferred to be composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas planets of intermediate density are inferred to have water as a major constituent. A planet of high density is inferred to be rocky, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System.

Gaseous planets that are hot is because they are close to their star, or because they are still hot from their formation and are expanded by the heat. For colder gas planets, there is a maximum radius which is slightly larger than Jupiter which occurs when the mass reaches a few Jupiter-masses. Adding mass beyond this point causes the radius to shrink.&lt;ref name="whatbasribrown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seager, S. and Lissauer, J. J.

Even when taking heat from the star into account, many transiting exoplanets are much larger than expected given their mass, meaning that they have surprisingly low density.&lt;ref name="baraffe10"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/73/1/016901| title = The physical properties of extra-solar planets| journal = Reports on Progress in Physics| volume = 73| issue = 1| page = 016901| year = 2010| last1 = Baraffe | first1 = I. | last2 = Chabrier | first2 = G. | last3 = Barman | first3 = T. |arxiv = 1001.3577 |bibcode = 2010RPPh...73a6901B | citeseerx = 10.1.1.754.8799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and gas dwarfs ====
{{Main article|Super-Earth|Mini-Neptune|Helium planet|Gas dwarf}}
If a planet has a radius and/or mass between that of Earth and Neptune, then there is a question about whether the planet is rocky like Earth, a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune, a small planet with a hydrogen/helium envelope (mini-Jupiter), or of some other composition.

Some of the Kepler transiting planets with radii in the range of 1–4 Earth radii have had their masses measured by radial-velocity or transit-timing methods. The calculated densities show that up to 1.5 Earth radii, these planets are rocky and that density increases with increasing radius due to gravitational compression. However, between 1.5 and 4 Earth radii the density decreases with increasing radius. This indicates that above 1.5 Earth radii, planets tend to have increasing amounts of volatiles and gas. Despite this general trend, there is a wide range of masses at a given radius, which could be because gas planets can have rocky cores of different masses and compositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/783/1/L6| title = The Mass-Radius Relation for 65 Exoplanets Smaller Than 4 Earth Radii| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 783| issue = 1| pages = L6| year = 2014| last1 = Weiss | first1 = L.

Excluding close-in planets that have lost their gas envelope due to stellar irradiation, studies of the [[metallicity]] of stars suggest a dividing line of 1.7 Earth radii between rocky planets and gas dwarfs, then another dividing line at 3.9 Earth radii between gas dwarfs and gas giants. These dividing lines are statistical trends and do not apply universally, because there are many other factors besides metallicity that affect planet formation, including distance from star – there may be larger rocky planets that formed at larger distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13254| pmid = 24870544| title = Three regimes of extrasolar planet radius inferred from host star metallicities| journal = Nature| volume = 509| issue = 7502| pages = 593–595| year = 2014| last1 = Buchhave | first1 = L.

An independent reanalysis of the data suggests that there are no such dividing lines and that there is a continuum of planet formation between 1 and 4 Earth radii and no reason to suspect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines whether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1501.05953|bibcode = 2015ApJ...799L..26S |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/799/2/L26 | volume=799 |issue = 2 |title=A Continuum of Planet Formation between 1 and 4 Earth Radii |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |pages=L26|year = 2015 |last1 = Schlaufman |first1 = Kevin C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done in 2016 based on over 300 planets suggest that most objects over approximately two Earth masses collect significant hydrogen–helium envelopes, meaning rocky super-Earths may be rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1603.08614| title=Probabilistic Forecasting of the Masses and Radii of Other Worlds| author=Jingjing Chen| author2=David M.

[[Transit-timing variation]] measurements indicate that Kepler-52b, Kepler-52c and Kepler-57b have maximum masses between 30 and 100 times that of Earth, although the actual masses could be much lower. With radii about 2 Earth radii in size, they might have densities larger than that of an [[iron planet]] of the same size. They orbit very close to their stars, so they could each be the remnant core ([[chthonian planet]]) of an evaporated [[gas giant]] or [[brown dwarf]]. If a remnant core is massive enough it could remain in such a state for billions of years despite having lost the atmospheric mass.&lt;ref&gt;Mocquet, A.; Grasset, O.; Sotin, C.

Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars ([[B-type main-sequence star|B-type]] and [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type]] stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the [[protoplanetary disk]] would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high [[UV radiation]] and [[stellar wind|winds]] that could [[Photoevaporation|photoevaporate]] the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/521346| title = Mass‐Radius Relationships for Solid Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 669| issue = 2| pages = 1279–1297| year = 2007| last1 = Seager | first1 = S.| last2 = Kuchner | first2 = M.| last3 = Hier‐Majumder | first3 = C.

For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13-Jupiter-mass limit used in the [[IAU]]'s working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold" /&gt;

Cold planets have a maximum radius because adding more mass at that point causes the planet to compress under the weight instead of increasing the radius. The maximum radius for solid planets is lower than the maximum radius for gas planets.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold"/&gt;

=== Shape ===
When the size of a planet is described using its radius, this is approximating the shape by a sphere. However, the rotation of a planet causes it to be flattened at the poles; so the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, making it closer to an [[oblate spheroid]]. The oblateness of [[transit method|transiting]] exoplanets will affect the transit light curves. At the limits of current technology it has been possible to show that [[HD 189733b]] is less oblate than [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="CarterWinn"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/709/2/1219| title = Empirical Constraints on the Oblateness of an Exoplanet| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 709| issue = 2| pages = 1219–1229| year = 2010| last1 = Carter | first1 = J.

If the planet is close to its star, then gravitational tides will elongate the planet in the direction of the star, making the planet closer to a [[triaxial ellipsoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015811| title = Distorted, nonspherical transiting planets: Impact on the transit depth and on the radius determination| journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics| volume = 528| pages = A41| year = 2011| last1 = Leconte | first1 = J.| last2 = Lai | first2 = D.| last3 = Chabrier | first3 = G. | bibcode=2011A&amp;A...528A..41L|arxiv = 1101.2813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because tidal deformation is along a line between the planet and the star, it is difficult to detect from transit photometry; it will have an effect on the transit light curves an order of magnitude less than that caused by rotational deformation even in cases where tidal deformation is larger than rotational deformation (as is the case for tidally locked [[hot Jupiter]]s).&lt;ref name="CarterWinn" /&gt; Material rigidity of rocky planets and rocky cores of gas planets will cause further deviations from the aforementioned shapes.&lt;ref name="CarterWinn" /&gt; Thermal tides caused by unevenly irradiated surfaces are another factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0901.0735 |last1=Arras |first1=Phil |title=Thermal Tides in Short Period Exoplanets |last2=Socrates |first2=Aristotle |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surface ==

=== Surface composition ===
Surface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with [[transmission spectroscopy]]. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1204.1544|bibcode = 2012ApJ...752....7H |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/752/1/7 | volume=752|issue = 1 | title=Theoretical Spectra of Terrestrial Exoplanet Surfaces| journal=The Astrophysical Journal| page=7|year = 2012 |last1 = Hu |first1 = Renyu |last2 = Ehlmann |first2 = Bethany L. |last3 = Seager |first3 = Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature of an exoplanet can be estimated by measuring the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star. For example, the planet [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly −220&amp;nbsp;°C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet's usually unknown [[albedo]], and because factors such as the [[greenhouse effect]] may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet [[HD 189733b]] has been estimated to have an average temperature of 1,205 K (932&amp;nbsp;°C) on its dayside and 973 K (700&amp;nbsp;°C) on its nightside.&lt;ref name="knutson_charbonneau07"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature05782 | url=http://www.ucolick.org/~jfortney/papers/Knutson07.pdf|arxiv=0705.0993 | pmid=17495920 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..183K  | title = A map of the day–night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7141 | pages = 183–6 | year = 2007 | last1 = Knutson | first1 = H.

=== Habitable zone ===
{{main article|Habitable zone}}
The habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star, so that the habitable zone can be at different distances for different stars. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: [[desert planet]]s (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

Planetary [[#Rotation and axial tilt|rotation rate]] is one of the major factors determining the [[#Atmospheric circulation|circulation of the atmosphere]] and hence the pattern of clouds: slowly rotating planets create thick clouds that [[albedo|reflect]] more and so can be habitable much closer to their star. Earth with its current atmosphere would be habitable in Venus's orbit, if it had Venus's slow rotation. If Venus lost its water ocean due to a [[runaway greenhouse effect#Venus|runaway greenhouse effect]], it is likely to have had a higher rotation rate in the past.

=== Ice ages and snowball states ===
{{See also|Ice age|Snowball Earth}}
The outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets are completely frozen, but  planets well inside the habitable zone can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling then this creates more ice, but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling, creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen, this stops [[Solution weathering|carbon dioxide weathering]], resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions. This creates a [[greenhouse effect]] which thaws the planet again.

=== Tidal heating ===
If a planet has an eccentric orbit, then [[tidal heating]] can provide another source of energy besides stellar radiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water. Tides also [[tidal circularization|circularize]] orbits over time so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0851| pmid = 23537135| title = Tidal Venuses: Triggering a Climate Catastrophe via Tidal Heating| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 13| issue = 3| pages = 225–250| year = 2013| last1 = Barnes | first1 = R. | last2 = Mullins | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldblatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Meadows | first4 = V.

The '''Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology''' was one of 24 Subject Centres funded within the [[Higher Education Academy]] to promote high quality learning and teaching in [[UK]] [[Higher Education]] (HE) by providing subject-based support for sharing innovations and good practices. Initially the only one of the 24 Subject Centres to be sited in Scotland, it was hosted originally by the [[University of Glasgow]] and later by the [[University of Liverpool]]. Its various Directors were Dr Andrew Roach, Dr Donald Spaeth, Colin Brooks and Dr Anthony Sinclair.

The Higher Education Academy itself came into being in 2004 through the amalgamation of the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), the Institute for the Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILTHE) and the Higher Education Staff Development Agency (HESDA) in order to enable comprehensive, knowledgeable support for practitioners and institutions with an aim to the greater professionalisation of HE teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/hefce/2003/tqec.htm HEFCE : News : 2003 : 27 January 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology supported teaching and learning in [[history]], [[archaeology]], and [[classics]] as broadly defined (the study of the languages and cultures of the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Worlds, including [[Byzantine Studies]] and Classical Reception Studies). 

The key role of HCA was to be a "one stop shop" for the subject communities for matters relating to learning and teaching both at an individual subject level and with regard to common issues across these three [[Humanities]] disciplines. HCA did this by identifying, collecting and disseminating information and material on good practice in teaching and learning, enabling practitioners to share their experience with colleagues for mutual benefit. HCA both funded &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hca/funding/tdg Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology - funding TDG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and published disciplinary specific pedagogical research (Ped Res) and development (Ped Dev) and [[scholarship of teaching and learning]] (SOTL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hca/themes/practice/pedr Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology - practice &amp; CPD, pedagogic research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology worked in conjunction with its various subject associations and other relevant national organisations to influence the development of policy and practice within History, Classics and Archaeology in UK higher education. It held several well-attended 3-day Teaching &amp; Learning in History conferences annually at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford.

[[File:David Playing the Harp 1670 Jan de Bray.jpg|thumb|250px|''David Playing the Harp''  by [[Jan de Bray]], 1670.]]
Knowledge of the biblical period is mostly from literary references in the [[Bible]] and post-biblical sources. Religion and music historian Herbert Lockyer, Jr. writes that "music, both vocal and instrumental, was well cultivated among the [[Hebrews]], the [[New Testament]] Christians, and the [[Christian church]] through the centuries."&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a look at the [[Old Testament]] reveals how God's ancient people were devoted to the study and practice of music, which holds a unique place in the historical and prophetic books, as well as the Psalter."

The music of religious ritual was first used by [[King David]], and, according to the ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', he is credited with confirming the men of the [[Tribe of Levi]] as the "custodians of the music of the divine service."&lt;ref name=Hindley&gt;Hindley, Geoffrey. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Music'', Chartwell (1971), Ch. "Jewish Music"&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Irene Hesk notes that of the twenty-four books of the [[Old Testament]], the 150 Psalms in the [[Book of Psalms]] ascribed to King David, have served as "the bedrock of Judeo-Christian hymnology," concluding that "no other poetry has been set to music more often in [[Western civilization]]."&lt;ref name=Hesk&gt;Hesk, Irene. ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing (1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ancient musical instruments has been practiced for centuries with some researchers studying instruments from [[Israel]]/[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] dating to the "biblical period."&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|145}} Archaeological and written data have demonstrated clearly that music was an integral part of daily life in ancient Israel/Palestine. Figurines and [[iconograph]]ic depictions show that people played [[chordophone]]s and [[frame drum]]s, and that the human voice was essential as women and men sang love songs along with laments for the deceased. Data also describes outdoor scenes of music and dancing in sometimes prophetic frenzies, often with carefully orchestrated and choreographed musicians and singers within specially built structures.&lt;ref name=Burgh/&gt;{{rp|106}}

According to ancient music historian Theodore Burgh, "If we were able to step into the . . . biblical period, we would find a culture filled with music . . . where people used music in their daily lives."&lt;ref name=Burgh&gt;Burgh, Theodore W. ''Listening to the Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Palestine'', T &amp; T Clark International (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; "Such music was capable of expressing a great variety of moods and feelings or the broadly marked antitheses of joy and sorrow, hope and fear, faith and doubt. In fact, every shade and quality of sentiment are found in the wealth of songs and psalms and in the diverse melodies of the people."&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|X}}

==Cultural influences==

===Egypt===
[[Egypt]] was among the oldest cultures of the [[Near East]] and had a highly developed musical culture dating back to around 3000 BC. Egyptian sources, however, include only pictorial relics, some instruments, and a few literary records concerned with performance practices. On various pieces of sculpture there are reliefs of harpists and flutists taking part in religious ceremonies and social entertainments.

A number of instruments have been identified as being used in Egypt, including the [[lyre]] (a type of [[harp]]), an [[oboe]]-like instrument, various drums from Asia, the [[lute]] and the [[sistrum]] (rattle). [[Mural]]s showing singers and instrumentalist performing have also been found. According to music historian Homer Ulrich, it is likely that Egypt influenced the "educational and ethical aspects of [[Greek music]]."&lt;ref name=Ulrich&gt;Ulrich, Homer. ''A History of Music and Musical Style'', Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc. (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Stephen Batuk equally observed that the historical link of music was consummated during the week of creation where birds in the air make sounds which could be seen as music.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Sumer and Babylonia===
{{main|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Although records are minimal, it is known that between 3000 and 2300 BC organized temple music with singers existed in [[Sumer]] and [[Babylonia]], the oldest cultural groups in [[Mesopotamia]]. Excavations have uncovered several musical instruments, including harps, lutes, double oboes, and a few others.

Because of the political interrelations between the Hebrews and the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] nations of Babylonia, [[Assyria]], and the [[Hittite empire]], there were similarities between the Hebrew music of the [[Judea]]n people and the others. Jewish music began in the early years of tribal life, and the "references to music in the Bible are numerous," writes Ulrich.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;{{rp|11}} After the Hebrews established a kingdom in [[Israel]], their musical activities were to increase substantially.

==Ancient Israel==
[[File:Miriam.JPG|thumb|18th-century painting, "The Song of Miriam," by Paulo Malteis, Italy. Celebration after crossing the Red Sea from Egypt]]
According to music historian Abraham Schwadron, "probably the most important musical contribution of the ancient Hebrews was the elevation of the status of [[liturgy|liturgical]] music in union with ritual ceremonies."  He notes the "high degree of musico-liturgical organization" from the descriptive accounts of King [[Solomon's Temple]], such as the 24 choral groups consisting of 288 musicians which took part in 21 weekly services.&lt;ref name=Schwadron&gt;Schwadron, Abraham A. ''Music of Many Cultures: An Introduction'', Ch. 16. Univ. of California Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the similar instruments used by the Hebrews which were also used in neighboring cultures, including [[Phoenicia]], [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], and [[Greece]], Schwadron writes that "it would be accurate to state that . . . it is in the particular uses of music—sacred and secular, ethical and aesthetical—that ancient [[Jewish music]] made a unique contribution.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

Music historian John Stainer notes that the earlier relationship between [[Abraham]] and the [[Canaanites]] "in all probability influenced future Hebrew music," and which probably caused his posterity to carry a certain amount of Assyrian music or musical instruments into Egypt. He adds that a stay of four centuries "in so civilized a culture as Egypt must have largely added to their knowledge of the art."&lt;ref name=Stainer&gt;Stainer, John. ''Music of the Bible'', Da Capo Press (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Although the ancient music of the Psalms and the other Bible books (which were all chanted), is often thought to be lost, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible contains [[cantillation]] marks indicating a melodic line for the words. Following the French archaeomusicologist Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, some authorities now argue that these cantillation marks date from temple times and record the music sung in the temple. Attempts have been made to decipher them in modern musical notation.&lt;ref name=Haik-Vantoura&gt;Haik-Vantoura, Suzanne ''La musique de la Bible révélée (Robert Dumas: Paris, 1976)''; Mitchell, David C. ''[https://www.amazon.com/Songs-Ascents-Worship-Jerusalems-Temples/dp/1508745358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427658006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mitchell+songs+of+ascents The Songs of Ascents]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babylonian exile===
The musical traditions of the Temple were rudely broken by the destruction of the [[First Temple]] and the exile of the Jews in [[Babylon]] during the 6th century BC. Hindley notes that most of the [[psalms]] seem to have been written in the years after the return of the Jews to [[Jerusalem]]. At this time too the practice of [[antiphonal]] singing between the [[Hazzan|cantor]] and the congregation seems to have become common.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The music of [[ancient Israel]] represents almost fourteen centuries of change, roughly from 1300 BC to 70 AD, when [[Titus]]' [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] took place. Stainer points out the lack of many artifacts during this period. He concludes that the "sad lack of national monuments relating to the Jews is not surprising, when it is remembered that Jerusalem stood about seventeen sieges, each of which was accompanied by more or less destruction, and that, too, at the hands of victors who seemed to take a malicious delight in effacing the national characteristics of those they conquered."&lt;ref name=Stainer/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Second Temple destruction===
However, after the fall of the First Temple, Werner states that the fabric of dreams spun about its earlier music included reminiscences, visions, and fantasies, as the Rabbis took pains to eradicate both its choral and instrumental traditions. "Their time had arrived, and their ideas on liturgy and music were radically different from those of the Temple priests." Werner finds it paradoxical that modern day rabbis continue to praise the instrumental music of the Temple but prohibit any and all instrumental music in their synagogues today.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|18}}

The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD led to the collapse of the Hebrew nation and the beginning of the [[Diaspora]] (dispersion or exile) of Jews to other lands, such as Spain, Italy, and the [[Rhineland]]. In these places, the synagogue would replace the destroyed Temple, with new liturgical services, prayers, and rabbinical writings oriented to mourning the loss of both the Temple and personal freedom.&lt;ref name=Schwadron/&gt;

==Christian period==
[[File:Vatican image.jpg|thumb|Fresco of angel playing a lute by [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Very little is known about primitive [[Christian music]], notes Whitcomb, because like most of the ancient, it was unwritten. As a result, as songs passed from generation to generation, they grew very different from the original. However, she notes that "much of this early music derived its beauty from the [[Greeks]] and its holiness from the [[Hebrews]]."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; According to Ulrich, Hebrew music "was of direct and immediate influence on the musical practices of the early Christian church."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; He cites Werner in noting that "the connections between Hebrew and Christian [[chant]] have been scientifically investigated and proved."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical art of the [[Levites]], the Temple musicians who were named after their historic ancestors, was lost by the end of the 1st century. In 70 AD the [[Second Temple]] was destroyed by the troops of the [[Emperor Titus]] and in the years following the Levites along with the majority of Jews fled from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. As a result, the synagogue music of the [[Jewish diaspora|Dispersion]] lost the joyful character of that of the Temple and the large instrumental forces were dispensed with.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] was not written until centuries later than the old and the music had attained much higher development, according to music historian Ida Whitcomb. As it related to Christ, it is called [[Christian music]]. However, there are but few allusions to it in three of the [[Gospels]]: in the [[Gospel of Luke]], there are the "Angels' Song," Mary's "Magnificat," and Zacharias's "Song." In [[Acts]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Silas]] sing behind prison-bars: the prison is shaken, the doors fly open, and they are free. In the [[Epistles]], there are but few references to music, but in [[Ephesians]] there is a "beautiful one," in which Paul exhorts the churches to sing "Psalms" and "spiritual songs."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Hindley adds that antiphonal chants between cantor or priest and the congregation originated in Hebrew worship methods. At its peak around the beginning of the [[Christian era]], the elaborate music of the Temple was performed by a large [[choir]] of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added, and during this period many instruments also were used by the Temple orchestra.&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;

Whitcomb adds that many of our noblest Church [[hymns]] have been suggested by the [[Psalms]], which she notes was "the first hymn-book of the Hebrew nation and remains today not only the hymn-book of the Hebrew Temple, but also of the Christian Church."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical instruments==
Among the earliest [[pictograph]]ic signs found have been of a boat-shaped [[harp]] found on a [[Sumer]]ian clay tablet dating back to 3000 BC, and an earlier depiction of this harp was also found in modern southwest [[Iran]] dating around 3200 BC.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|45}}

[[File:Bar Kokhba Coin.jpg|thumb|Bar Kochba coinage showing trumpets and a lyre, c. 132 AD]]
Many relics of musical instruments have been found in Palestine dating from the [[Hellenistic age]] giving details about the state, character, and practice of liturgical music.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; In other cases, many musical instruments of the Hebrews mentioned in the Bible are identified by analogy with similar instruments found in other nearby cultures, such as Egypt and Babylonia. An example of some instruments mentioned in the bible can be found in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 3:5:
{{quote|text=that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music...}}

According to Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], all details of the [[First Temple]], including its musical instruments, were made and viewed as "symbols of the universe," especially instruments like the [[kithara]] or [[lyre]]. In his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Josephus explains that the musical instruments, along with other matters of Jewish religion, represent a perishable "image" of the [[cosmos]], or of "a cosmic Temple."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===String instruments===
Lockyer notes that according to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). He points out that the harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and its use is found more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12).

Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD [[File:Sack of jerusalem.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Titus]] with silver trumpets]]

In addition to those, there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

===Wind instruments===
Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], [[flute]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}}

There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in Jewish communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Percussion instruments===
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|Miriam and women celebrate the crossing of the Red Sea; [[Tomić Psalter]], 1360/63]]
Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]].  Percussion instruments are those producing tones by being struck in various ways and have been used by bands and orchestras throughout history.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|59}}

The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

Whitcomb writes that "much of the most beautiful music of the Bible is contained in the Psalms," and the word "psalm" comes from the Greek word meaning "to sing, to strike lyre." The psalter or psaltery was one of the instruments which accompanied the Psalm.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The word soon came to signify any form of melody. The psalms were sung antiphonally or responsively, perhaps by the priest and congregation, or by two choruses.

According to Shiloah, most of the customs and ceremonies mentioned earlier, such as weddings or other celebrations, were accompanied by music made by women and attests to the importance of women's songs. But there were many instances where women sang alone or with friends and family. "The woman fortifies her spirit by singing to herself, and perhaps to her infant, who hears and absorbs the mother's confessions, longings, complaints, and dreams."  There were also "mother-songs, soldier-songs, grass-widow-songs, orphan-songs, and woman's-trade-songs." According to some, writes Shiloah, women's songs existed because of the need to compensate for the ban against public participation of women in synagogue rituals.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;

Ancient music historian Joachim Braun notes that Philo had mentioned ritualist vigils near Alexandria, that included a meal and the singing of hymns by a double chorus as accompaniment to the processions and libations.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;Braun, Joachim. ''Music in Ancient Israel/Palestine'', W. B. Eerdmans Publ. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
According to biblical historian Amnon Shiloah, dance was directly associated with music and was an important aspect of various events, although the actual dance movements are nowhere described in detail. There is meager evidence about dance when compared with a wider variety found in Egypt. However, there are many biblical descriptions of occasions that inspired dancing in biblical times.&lt;ref name=Shiloah/&gt;{{rp|209}}

In the Bible, Mishnah, and Talmud, dance is referred to in various contexts, and in Megido, the Negev, and other sites in Israel, recently found iconographic remnants show dancing figures. In Judg. 21:21, a festival is described during which it was customary to dance in the vineyards. Dancing was also associated with celebrations of military victories and for welcoming home heroes. In Exod. 15:20, Miriam and the other women burst into song and dance accompanied by drums to mark the parting of the Red Sea which saved the people of Israel; Jephtah's daughter danced to meet her father returning from victorious battles (Judg. 11:34); the women of Israel came out to dance before Saul and David upon their return from fighting the Philistines (1 Sam. 18:6); the king and his subjects were also inspired to dance when the Ark of the Covenant was brought up to Jerusalem (2 Sam. Ch. 6).&lt;ref name=Shiloah&gt;Shiloah, Amnon. ''Jewish Musical Traditions'', Wayne State Univ. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Musical traditions==

===Purposes of music===
The Bible mentions many uses of music including songs of praise, songs of victory, songs of mourning, and above all the Psalms. Dances were also a common music expression along with the combination of singing with instrumental music. During later times there was also a purely vocal music which prevailed for a period.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; According to Ulrich, music played an important part in both the secular and the religious life of the Hebrews. Kings and other leaders of the people were customarily acclaimed in songs and fanfares, and very elaborate musical services in the Temple, described in the Bible, were important parts of worship. There are, for instance, descriptions in the Bible of an orchestra consisting of nine lutes, two harps, and a cymbal.&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; In other parts there are accounts of all-women choirs combined with singing and dancing to the men's percussion accompaniment. Werner adds that the choir's repertoire consisted of psalms, canticles, and other poetic passages from Scripture, although it may have contained some noncanonical texts. The choice of psalms is said to have been determined by God's activities on the first seven days of creation, and the verses which allude to them.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|13}}

Werner writes that "unique in the history of music is the firm belief in the purifying and sin-atoning power of the Temple's music, ascribed to both chant and instruments."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt; The music had to be free from blemish or fault, and avoided magical elements. Even the High Priest's garment had symbolism: (Exod. 28:34–35): "a golden bell and a pomegranate, round about on the skirts of the robe . . . and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the Lord . . . " According to Philo and Josephus, the bells represented symbols of cosmic harmony.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Music training===
According to the text of the Mishna, the early musicians, both singers and instrumentalists, were strictly trained to be professional musicians with their average training lasting five years. Bible historian Alfred Sendrey notes a "sudden and unexplained upsurge of large [[choir]]s and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was the [[patriarch]] of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy [[David]] appears on the scene as a minstrel to [[King Saul]]." :"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of music===
Different types of music were also defined:&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt; 
*'''Cantillation.''' Used when parts of the Bible were read during the service and parts of the text were sung or chanted.
*'''Antiphony''' (also referred to as responsorial singing). Since Hebrew poetry is based on parallelism (the expression of one thought in two different ways), several types of performances were possible: either by two separate alternating choruses, or by a soloist alternating with the chorus. At its peak around the beginning of the Christian era, antiphonal music was performed by a large choir of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added. According to Hindley, "Antiphony is among the debts owed by Christian music to its Jewish predecessor."&lt;ref name=Hindley/&gt;
*'''Hymn songs.''' Within the service they were performed by either a soloist, called the cantor, or by groups. Some of the hymns were freely organized with groups of melodic [[motive (music)|motives]] with their variants connected to create a continuous melodic chant.
*'''Orchestration.''' Werner writes that "the sound of the Temple's orchestra consisted of never less than twelve instruments and rarely exceeded thirty-six." The trumpets were never mixed with the rest of the orchestra—being used for signals exclusively. One pair of cymbals were used in Temple rituals also as a signal instrument, "not unlike the gong in the modern theatre."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;

===Written notation===
Musical notation in the modern sense did not exist during this period. However, the Hebrew alphabet allows for special symbols to indicate how the music was to be performed. The alphabet consists of consonants and half-consonants, and vowels are indicated by dots and dashes above and below letter symbols. In addition to the vowel signs, a number of other signs, called "[[Tiberian vocalization|masoretic]]," refers not to single notes but to "melodic particles or groups," writes Ulrich. These particles were handed down by oral tradition among singers for centuries and were first codified in the 16th century. Ulrich notes that the "Dead Sea Scrolls contain signs similar to those in the liturgical script of early Christian sects . . . strengthening the conjecture that a common musical heritage is shared by the people of related cultures . . ."&lt;ref name=Ulrich/&gt;

==Influence on later music==
Music historian William Smoldon notes that despite the fact that instrumental music was not revived and used in the synagogue after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 AD, (excluding the symbolic [[Shofar]] still used in orthodox communities,) "the [[chant]] continued, and of late years research has made it increasingly clear that many of the forms and even melodic patterns of the [[Byzantine]] and Western Christian chants were adaptations from the music of the synagogues."&lt;ref name=Smoldon&gt;Smoldon, William. ''A History of Music'', Dimension Books, Inc. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also notes that after the collapse of the Western [[Roman Empire]], the "one steadfast feature was the Western Christian Church" which was "respected by the [[barbarians]]." He adds that there seems "little doubt that the worship-music of the early Church, i.e. at such centres as [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], grew from materials . . . of Greek and Syrian origins, together with the service-chants of the Jewish synagogue."&lt;ref name=Smoldon/&gt;{{rp|20}}

;Psalms
The [[Psalms]] have been sung through all the ages up to the present. Whitcomb describes the importance of the Psalms:
:"the [[Crusades|Crusader]] has chanted them as he ascended the Hill of [[Zion]]; and the victorious general was welcomed on his return by a hallelujah chorus. The sailor on the dark night at sea, the shepherd on the lonely plain, the little waif upon the street, have alike been cheered by the music of the Psalms. They have enlivened the vintage-feast, the boatman on the Rhine, the soldier by his camp-fire have been softened and the sad have been cheered by these sweet inspirations to faith, [[penitence]], thanksgiving, and adoration."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Lockyer writes that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor and champion of the pope, requested passages from his favorite psalm, Ps. 90, be read to him as he lay on his deathbed in September 1558. In that psalm, "[[Moses]] contrasts the eternity of God with the transience of human life, and Moses ends his song with a prayer for God's forgiveness and favor."(Ps 90:1–6)&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Human–animal marriage'''  is a marriage between a (non-human) animal and a human. This topic has appeared in mythology and [[magic in fiction|magical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diacronia.ro/en/journal/issue/4/A58/en/pdf Naithani, Sadhana (2014). Folklore Theory in Postwar Germany.] University Press of Mississippi. pp. 48–52. {{ISBN|9781617039942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century there have been numerous reports from around the world of humans marrying their pets and other animals. Human–animal marriage is often seen in accordance with [[zoophilia]], however they are not necessarily linked. Although animal-human marriage is not mentioned specifically in national laws, the act of engaging in [[Zoophilia and the law|sexual acts with an animal]] is illegal in many countries under animal abuse laws.

== Animal-human marriage in mythology ==
The practice of animal-human marriage has made appearances in several [[Mythology|mythological]] stories and [[folklore]], and is often understood to mean a deity-human marriage involving gods or heroes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alan L.|date=1995-01-01|title=The Woman Who Married a Horse: Five Ways of Looking at a Chinese Folktale|jstor=1178945|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=54|issue=2|pages=275–305|doi=10.2307/1178945}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese folktale 'The Goddess Of The Silkworm' is an example of a tale where a woman marries a horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar Irish legend tells of a king who marries a horse, symbolizing a divine union between the king and the goddess of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Y-7XvMVeYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography|last=Freeman|first=Philip|date=2004-03-17|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743267496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the indigenous [[Cheyenne]] have a story of animal-human marriage in 'The Girl who Married a dog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stensland|first=Anna Lee|date=1977-01-01|title=The Indian Presence in American Literature|jstor=815804|journal=The English Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=37–41|doi=10.2307/815804}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Native American stories about people who married animals.

== Animal-Human marriage in the real world ==
Although it is uncertain if there is a legal basis for marrying an animal, several individuals claim to have done so. The [[Sudanese goat marriage incident]] made big headlines in 2006 when a man was forced to marry a goat after being caught in a sexual interaction with the goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550479/Man-marries-goat-captivates-millions.html|title='Man marries goat' captivates millions|last=Staff|first=By Our Foreign|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of marriage include animals such as dogs, cats, frogs and a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3004930.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} South Asia {{!}} Girl weds dog to break 'evil spell'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/11/13/man-in-india-marries-dog-to-atone-for-stoning-to-death-mating-canines.html|title=Man in India Marries Dog to Atone for Stoning to Death Mating Canines|date=2007-11-13|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html|title=Sealed with a kiss: Man 'marries' his dog in sunset ceremony - but assures guests 'it's not sexual'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658327.stm|title=BBC News - German man 'marries' his dying cat|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4290761/Seven-year-old-Indian-girls-marry-frogs.html|title=Seven-year-old Indian girls 'marry' frogs|last=Delhi|first=By Dean Nelson in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/01/03/british-woman-marries-dolphin.html|title=British Woman Marries Dolphin|date=2006-01-03|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents of human animal relations took place in 2010, when 18-year-old Balinese man Ngurah Alit was found having sexual intercourse with a cow, who he claimed flirted with him.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/bali-teenager-passes-out-marrying-cow-he-had-sex-with/|title=Bali Teenager Passes Out Marrying Cow He Had Sex With {{!}} Jakarta Globe|work=Jakarta Globe|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Pecaruan ritual, the man was forced to marry the animal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The ceremony was thought to cleanse the village of the immoral act of bestiality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The cow was drowned in the ocean, while Alit was symbolically drowned as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">An '''Imieliński-Lipski algebras''' is an extension of [[relational algebra]] onto tables with different types of [[Null (SQL)|null values]].  It is used to operate on relations with incomplete information.

Imieliński-Lipski algebras are defined to satisfy precise conditions for  semantically meaningful extension of the usual relational operators, such as projection, selection, union, and join, from operators on relations to operators on relations with various kinds of "null values".

These conditions require that the system be ''safe'' in the sense that no incorrect conclusion is derivable by using a specified subset F of the relational operators; and that it be ''complete'' in the sense that all valid conclusions expressible by relational expressions using operators in F are in fact derivable in this system.  
For example, it is well known that the 3-valued logic approach to deal with null values, supported  treatment of nulls values by [[SQL]] is not complete, see [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] book.&lt;ref name="Ullman1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.D. Ullman|authorlink=Jeffrey Ullman|title=Principles of Database Systems |year=1982|publisher= Computer Science Press, Potomac, MD.|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To show this, let T be:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |+ T=
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || NULL
 |-
|}

Take SQL query Q

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
                Select NAME
                         From T
                             Where CLASS = 'Networks' &amp; SEMESTER = 'Spring' OR GRADE = 'A' &amp; SEMESTER != 'Spring'
&lt;/source&gt;

SQL query Q will return empty set (no results) under 3-valued semantics currently adopted by all variants of SQL.  This is the case because in SQL,  NULL is never equal to any constant – in this case, neither to “Spring” nor “Fall” nor “Winter” (if  there is Winter semester in this school).  NULL=’Spring” will evaluate to MAYBE and so will NULL=’Fall”. The disjunction MAYBE OR MAYBE evaluates to  MAYBE (not TRUE). Thus Igor will not be part of the answer (and of course neither will Rohit). But Igor should be returned as the answer.

Indeed, regardless what semester Igor took the Networks class (no matter what was the unknown value of NULL), the selection condition will be true.  This “Igor” will be missed by SQL and the SQL answer  won’t be  complete according to completeness requirements specified in  Imieliński, Witold Lipski, 'Incomplete Information in Relational Databases'.&lt;ref name="JACM 1984"/&gt;  It is also argued there that 3-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, MAYBE) can never provide guarantee  of complete answer for tables with incomplete information.

Three algebras which satisfy conditions of safety and completeness are defined as Imielinski-Lipski algebras: the [[Relational algebra|Codd-Tables]] algebra, the V-tables algebra and the Conditional tables (C-tables) algebra.

===Codd-tables Algebra===

Codd-tables Algebra is based on the usual Codd's   singe NULL values. The table T above is an example of Codd-table. Codd-table algebra supports projection and positive selections only.  It is also demonstrated in [IL84 that it is not possible to correctly extend more relational operators over Codd-Tables.  For example, such basic operation as join is not extendable over Codd-tables.  It is not possible to define selections with Boolean conditions involving negation and preserve completeness.  For example, queries like the above query Q cannot be supported.
In  order to be able to extend more relational operators,  more expressive form of  null value representation is needed in tables  which are called  V-table.

===V-Tables Algebra===

V-tables algebra is based on many different ("marked") null values or variables allowed to appear in a table.  V-tables allow to show that a value may be unknown but the same for different tuples. For example, in the table below Gaurav and Igor order the same (but unknown) beer in two unknown bars (which may, or may not be different – but remain unknown).   Gaurav and Jane frequent the same unknown bad (Y1). Thus, instead one NULL value, we use indexed variables, or ''Skolem constants''  
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title= Skolem constants |url=http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/spd/larch/LP/glossary/skolem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |-
 ! DRINKER   !! BEER !! BAR 
 |-
 | Zhihan  || Heineken  || Cabana
 |-
 | Gaurav  || X1  || Y1
 |-
 | Igor  || X1  || Y2
 |-
 | Jane  || Bud  || Y1
 |-
 | John  || X2  || Y3
 |-
|}

V-Tables algebra is shown to correctly support projection, positive selection (with no negation occurring in the selection condition), union, and renaming of attributes, which allows for processing arbitrary conjunctive queries.
A very desirable property enjoyed by the V-table algebra is that all relational operators on tables are performed in exactly the same way as in the case of the usual relations.

'''Conditional Tables (C-Tables) Algebra'''

Example of conditional table (c-table) is shown below.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER !! con
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring || true
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || x ='Spring'
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || x !='Spring'
 |-
|}

It has additional column “con” which is a Boolean condition involving variables, null values – same as in V-tables.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
                Select *
                     From T
                          Where CLASS='Networks' &amp; SEMESTER='Spring' OR GRADE = 'A' &amp; SEMESTER !='Spring'
&lt;/source&gt;

over the following table c-table

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |+ T1=
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER !! con
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring || true
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || true
 |-
|}

Conditional Tables algebra, mainly of theoretical interest, supports projection, selection, union, join, and renaming.  Under closed world assumption, it can also handle the operator of difference, thus it can support all relational operators.

In biblical studies, '''inclusio''' is a [[literary device]] based on a concentric principle, also known as '''bracketing''' or an '''envelope structure''', which consists of creating a frame by placing similar material at the beginning and end of a section, although whether this material should consist of a word or a phrase, or whether greater amounts of text also qualify, and of what length the frames section should be, are matters of some debate. Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new.  The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself.  An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Mark's treatment of the "Cursing of the Fig Tree" and the "Cleansing of the Temple" (Chapter 11).  By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a "frame" that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus' actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.

==In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)==

While this may not be evident to many of the Bible's modern day readers, the [[Hebrew Bible]] is full of literary devices, some of which, having fallen out of favor over the years, are lost on most modern readers. ''Inclusio'', of which many instances can be found in the Bible, is one of these, although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] source.

Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of ''inclusio'' in the [[Book of Jeremiah]]. A rather far-flung example of ''inclusio'' in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section, chapters 1–24, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs. ''Inclusio'' may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were entrusted. ''Bracketing'' can also be seen in The Lord's sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the ''inclusio'' formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads:

{| align="center" dir="rtl"
|כי אויל עמי אותי לא ידעו בנים סכלים המה ולא נבונים המה חכמים המה להרע ולהיטיב לא ידעו.
|}

{| align="center"
([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]: ''For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.'')
|}

The phrase "לא ידעו" (''did not know'') is found at the beginning and the end of The Lord's analysis of his people. English translations do not preserve this structure.

Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible. An obvious example of inclusio is found in the first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 "הודו לה' כי-טוב כי לעולם חסדו.". Another, more disputed, example may be found in the [[Book of Ruth]], where one finds a certain resemblance, if somewhat [[chiastic]], between 1:1 and 1:22—in the former Elimelekh leaves [[Bethlehem]] in favor of [[Moab]], and in the latter Ruth and [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] leave [[Moab]] in favor of Bethlehem.  Finally, it has been suggested that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2 contains inclusio, for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.

==In Rabbinic Literature==

The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that "Any psalm dear to David he opened with "אשרי" ('happy is he') and closed with "אשרי" ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At the end of the Mishnah tractate Kelim, R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: "Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with [statements regarding] impurity and departed with [statements regarding] purity." Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the שמע (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.

Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio. In the opening mishnah of Taanit Chapter 1, R. Joshua notes that rain on the festival of Sukkot is "not a sign of blessing", and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is "a sign of curse". This characterization of rainfall as God's way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the inclusio is based on a wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a "נפש אטומה" ('solid monument')and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because "אין דוחין נפש מפני נפש" ('one soul may not be set aside in favor of another'). The use of the word נפש (nefesh) at the beginning and the end of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.

Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of BT Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool.

==In the New Testament==

The [[New Testament]] also uses inclusio. The main teaching part in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] starts and ends with the expression “the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12). [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]’s account of the first part of [[Jesus]]’ public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 +9:35).
Also, Matthew’s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus' name would be “Emmanuel, that is, ‘God with us,’” (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, "I am with you always, to the end of the age". This forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. 
The [[letter to the Hebrews]] uses [[Jeremiah]]’s prophecy as an inclusio in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18.
There are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.

The theory was originally developed to explain species richness of actual islands, principally oceanic.

The field was started in the 1960s by the ecologists [[Robert MacArthur|Robert H. MacArthur]]&lt;!--The book title includes the initial.--&gt; and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;!--He really goes by "E. O." conventionally.--&gt;,&lt;ref name="MacArthur &amp; Wilson 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur |first1=Robert H. |authorlink1=Robert MacArthur |last2=Wilson |first2=E. O. |authorlink2=E. O.

== Definitions ==
For biogeographical purposes, an insular environment or "island" is any area of habitat suitable for a specific ecosystem, surrounded by an expanse of unsuitable habitat.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} While this may be a traditional [[island]]—a mass of land surrounded by water—the term may also be applied to many nontraditional "islands", such as the peaks of mountains,&lt;ref name="Brown 1978" /&gt; isolated springs or lakes surrounded by desert,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, and non-contiguous woodlands.&lt;ref name="Sahney, Benton, Ferry 2010" /&gt; The concept is often applied to natural habitats surrounded by human-altered landscapes, such as expanses of [[grassland]] surrounded by highways or housing tracts{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, and national parks.&lt;ref name="Newmark 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newmark |first=W.

== Theory ==
The theory of insular biogeography proposes that the number of species found in an undisturbed insular environment ("island") is determined by [[immigration]] and [[extinction]]. And further, that the isolated populations may follow different evolutionary routes, as shown by Darwin's observation of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] in the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Immigration and emigration are affected by the distance of an island from a source of colonists ([[Distance decay|distance effect]]). Usually this source is the mainland, but it can also be other islands. Islands that are more isolated are less likely to receive immigrants than islands that are less isolated.

The rate of extinction once a species manages to colonize an island is affected by island size; this is the [[species-area curve]] or effect. Larger islands contain larger habitat areas and opportunities for more different varieties of habitat. Larger habitat size reduces the probability of extinction due to [[Stochastic|chance]] [[Event (probability theory)|events]]. [[Habitat]] [[heterogeneity]] increases the number of species that will be successful after immigration.

Over time, the countervailing forces of extinction and immigration result in an equilibrium level of species richness.

[[File:Insular Biogeography (Distance).png|thumb|This diagram shows the effect of an island’s distance from the mainland on the amount of species richness. The sizes of the two islands are approximately the same. Island 1 receives more random dispersion of organisms, while island number two, since it is farther away, receives less random dispersion of organisms.]]

[[File:Insular Biogeography (Size).png|thumb|This diagram shows the effect of an island’s size on the amount of species richness. The diagram shows two islands equidistant from the mainland. Island 1 receives less random dispersion of organisms. While island 2 receives more of the arrows and therefore more random dispersion of organisms.]]

=== Modifications ===

In addition to having an effect on immigration rates, isolation can also affect extinction rates.  Populations on islands that are less isolated are less likely to go extinct because individuals from the source population and other islands can immigrate and "rescue" the population from extinction; this is known as the rescue effect.

In addition to having an effect on extinction, island size can also affect immigration rates.  Species may actively target larger islands for their greater number of resources and available niches; or, larger islands may accumulate more species by chance just because they are larger. This is the target effect.

=== Influencing factors ===
[[Image:Area species curve herpetofauna.svg|thumb|right|220px|Total number of reptilian and amphibian species on seven small and large islands in the [[West Indies]]]]
* Degree of isolation (distance to nearest neighbour, and mainland)
* Length of isolation (time)
* Size of island (larger area usually facilitates greater diversity)
* The habitat suitability which includes:
** Climate (tropical versus arctic, humid versus arid, etc.)
** Initial plant and animal composition if previously attached to a larger land mass  (e.g. [[marsupials]], [[primates]])
** The current species composition
* Location relative to ocean currents (influences nutrient, fish, bird, and seed flow patterns)
* [[Serendipity]] (the impacts of chance arrivals)
* Human activity

== Historical record ==
The theory can be studied through the fossils, which provide a record of life on Earth. 300 million years ago, Europe and North America lay on the equator and were covered by steamy tropical rainforests. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during the [[Carboniferous]] Period and as the climate grew drier, rainforests fragmented. Shrunken islands of forest were uninhabitable for amphibians but were well suited to reptiles, which became more diverse and even varied their diet in the rapidly changing environment; this [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse]] event triggered an evolutionary burst among reptiles.&lt;ref name="Sahney, Benton, Ferry 2010" /&gt;

== Research experiments ==
The theory of island biogeography was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his student [[Daniel Simberloff]] in the [[mangrove]] islands in the [[Florida Keys]].&lt;ref name = "Simberloff"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |last2=Wilson |first2=Edward O. |authorlink2=E. O. Wilson 
  | title = Experimental Zoogeography of islands - colonization of empty islands | journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]  | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 278–296
  | publisher = [[Ecological Society of America]] | date = March 1969
  | url = http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/mbinford/GEOXXXX_Biogeography/LiteratureForLinks/Simberloff_and_Wilson_1969_colonization_of_empty_islands_Ecology.pdf
  |doi=10.2307/1934856 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species richness on several small mangroves islands were surveyed. The islands were fumigated with [[methyl bromide]] to clear their [[arthropod]] communities. Following fumigation the immigration of species onto the islands was monitored. Within a year the islands had been recolonised. Islands closer to the mainland recovered faster as predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography. The effect of island size was not tested, since all islands were of approximately equal size.

Research conducted at the rainforest research station on [[Barro Colorado Island]] has yielded a large number of publications concerning the ecological changes following the formation of islands, such as the local extinction of large predators and the subsequent changes in prey populations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Applications in conservation biology ==

Within a few years of the publishing of the theory, its potential application to the field of [[conservation biology]] had been realised and was being vigorously debated in [[ecology|ecological]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lomolino |first=Mark V. |title=A Call for a New Paradigm of Island Biogeography |work=Global Ecology and Biogeography: A Journal of Macroecology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=January 2000 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00185.x/abstract |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that reserves and [[national park]]s formed islands inside human-altered landscapes ([[habitat fragmentation]]), and that these reserves could lose species as they 'relaxed towards equilibrium' (that is they would lose species as they achieved their new equilibrium number, known as ecosystem decay) caused a great deal of concern. This is particularly true when conserving larger species which tend to have larger ranges. A study by William Newmark, published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and reported in the [[New York Times]], showed a strong [[correlation]] between the size of a protected [[United States|U.S.]] National Park and the number of species of mammals.

This led to the debate known as [[SLOSS debate|single large or several small]] (SLOSS), described by writer [[David Quammen]] in ''The Song of the Dodo'' as "ecology's own genteel version of trench warfare".&lt;ref name = "Quammen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Quammen |first=David |title=The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions |publisher=Scribner |year=1996 |isbn=0-684-80083-7 |page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after the publication of Wilson and Simberloff's papers ecologists had found more examples of the species-area relationship, and conservation planning was taking the view that the one large reserve could hold more species than several smaller reserves, and that larger reserves should be the norm in [[reserve design]]. This view was in particular championed by [[Jared Diamond]]. This led to concern by other ecologists, including Dan Simberloff, who considered this to be an unproven over-simplification that would damage conservation efforts. Habitat diversity was as or more important than size in determining the number of species protected.

Island biogeography theory also led to the development of [[wildlife corridor]]s as a conservation tool to increase connectivity between habitat islands. Wildlife corridors can increase the movement of species between parks and reserves and therefore increase the number of species that can be supported, but they can also allow for the spread of disease and pathogens between populations, complicating the simple proscription of connectivity being good for biodiversity.

In species diversity, island biogeography most describes [[allopatric speciation]]. Allopatric speciation is where new gene pools arise out of natural selection in isolated gene pools. Island biogeography is also useful in considering [[sympatric speciation]], the idea of different species arising from one ancestral species in the same area. Interbreeding between the two differently adapted species would prevent speciation, but in some species, sympatric speciation appears to have occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12412">The '''interplanetary dust cloud''', or '''zodiacal cloud''', consists of [[cosmic dust]] (small particles floating in [[outer space]]) that pervades the space between [[planet]]s within [[planetary system]]s such as the [[Solar System]]. This system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature, origin, and relationship to larger bodies.

In our [[Solar System]], the interplanetary dust particles have a role in [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] [[sunlight]] and in emitting [[thermal radiation]], which is the most prominent feature of the [[night sky]]'s radiation with wavelengths ranging 5–50 [[micrometer|μm]].&lt;ref&gt;Levasseur-Regourd, A.C., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The [[particle size]]s of grains characterizing the [[infrared]] emission near [[Earth's orbit]] typically range 10–100 μm.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, D., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately the mass of an [[asteroid]] of radius 15 km (with density of about 2.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pavlov |first=Alexander A. |date= |title=Irradiated interplanetary dust particles as a possible solution for the deuterium/hydrogen paradox of Earth's oceans |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999JE001120/full#references |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=104 |pages=30725-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straddling the [[zodiac]] along the [[ecliptic]], this dust cloud is visible as the [[zodiacal light]] in a moonless and naturally dark  sky and is best seen toward the Sun's direction during astronomical [[twilight]].

== Origin ==
The sources of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) include at least: asteroid collisions, [[comet]]ary activity and collisions in the inner Solar System, [[Kuiper belt]] collisions, and [[interstellar medium]] grains (Backman, D., 1997). Indeed, one of the longest-standing controversies debated in the interplanetary dust community revolves around the relative contributions to the interplanetary dust cloud from asteroid collisions and cometary activity.

== Life cycle of a particle ==

The main physical processes "affecting" (destruction or expulsion mechanisms) interplanetary dust particles are: expulsion by [[radiation pressure]], inward [[Poynting-Robertson drag|Poynting-Robertson (PR) radiation drag]], [[solar wind]] pressure (with significant electromagnetic effects), [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], mutual collisions, and the dynamical effects of planets (Backman, D., 1997).

The lifetimes of these dust particles are very short compared to the lifetime of the Solar System. If one finds grains around a star that is older than about 10,000,000 years, then the grains must have been from recently released fragments of larger objects, i.e. they cannot be leftover grains from the [[protoplanetary disk]] (Backman, private communication).{{cn|reason=We can't use private communications.  Technically I ought to remove this claim.  But I don't want to, because it's very interesting and seems likely to be supported &amp;mdash; just someone needs to find an RS.|date=March 2018}} Therefore, the grains would be "later-generation" dust. The zodiacal dust in the Solar System is 99.9% later-generation dust and 0.1% intruding [[interstellar medium]] dust. All primordial grains from the Solar System's formation were removed long ago.

Particles which are affected primarily by radiation pressure are known as "beta meteoroids". They are generally less than 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g and are pushed outward from the Sun into interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/genesis/DocumentN.html#BeMe |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826132615/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/genesis/DocumentN.html |archivedate=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cloud structures ==

The interplanetary dust cloud has a complex structure (Reach, W., 1997). Apart from a background density, this includes:
* At least 8 [[dust trail]]s—their source is thought to be [[short-period comet]]s.
* A number of dust bands, the sources of which are thought to be [[asteroid families]] in the [[main asteroid belt]]. The three strongest bands arise from the [[Themis family]], the [[Koronis family]], and the [[Eos family]]. Other source families include the [[Maria family|Maria]], [[Eunomia family|Eunomia]], and possibly the [[Vesta family|Vesta]] and/or [[Hygiea family|Hygiea]] families (Reach et al. 1996).
* At least 2 resonant dust rings are known (for example, the Earth-resonant dust ring, although every planet in the Solar System is thought to have a resonant ring with a "wake") (Jackson and Zook, 1988, 1992) (Dermott, S.F. et al., 1994, 1997)

== Dust collection on Earth==

In 1951, [[Fred Whipple]] predicted that micrometeorites smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter might be decelerated on impact with the Earth's upper atmosphere without melting.&lt;ref name="Whipple-1950" /&gt; The modern era of laboratory study of these particles began with the stratospheric collection flights of D. E. Brownlee and collaborators in the 1970s using balloons and then [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="Brownlee-1977" /&gt;

Although some of the particles found were similar to the material in present-day meteorite collections, the [[nanoporous]] nature and unequilibrated cosmic-average composition of other particles suggested that they began as fine-grained aggregates of nonvolatile building blocks and cometary ice.&lt;ref&gt;P. Fraundorf, D. E. Brownlee, and R. M. Walker (1982) Laboratory studies of interplanetary dust, in ''Comets'' (ed. L. Wilkening, U. Arizona Press, Tucson) pp. 383-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker-1986" /&gt; The interplanetary nature of these particles was later verified by [[noble gas]]&lt;ref name="Hudson-1981" /&gt; and [[solar flare]] track&lt;ref name="Bradley-1984" /&gt; observations.

In that context a program for atmospheric collection and curation of these particles was developed at [[Johnson Space Center]] in Texas.&lt;ref name="Cosmic-Dust-Sample-Collection" /&gt; This stratospheric micrometeorite collection, along with [[presolar grains]] from meteorites, are unique sources of [[extraterrestrial material]] (not to mention being small astronomical objects in their own right) available for study in laboratories today.

For a series of ''N'' components, this is expressed as:&lt;ref name="DeVale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/traditional_reliability/presentation.pdf | title=Basics of Traditional Reliability | date=1998 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=DeVale, J. | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ausairpower.net/PDF-A/Reliability-PHA.pdf | title=System Reliability and Metrics of Reliability | publisher=Peter Harding &amp; Associates, Pty Ltd | date=1996 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=Kopp, C. | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the failure probabilities of all components are equal, then as Lusser's colleague [[Erich Pieruschka]] observed, this can be expressed simply as:&lt;ref name="DeVale" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=r^N&lt;/math&gt;

Lusser's law has been described as the idea that a series system is  "weaker than its weakest link", as the product reliability of a series of components can be less than the lowest-value component.&lt;ref name="Critchley"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ltAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=Lusser%27s+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SNPCKYZh-o&amp;sig=NUsUd9m3e45m87gG_bSxWjA7kps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwB2oVChMI0ZO-5qOfxwIVh4kaCh3oaw9V#v=onepage&amp;q=Lusser's%20law&amp;f=false | title=High Availability IT Services | publisher=CRC Press | author=Critchley, Terry | year=2014 | pages=117 | isbn=9781482255911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, given a series system of two components with different reliabilities — one of 0.95 and the other of 0.8 — Lusser's law will predict a reliability of

:&lt;math&gt;R_s = 0.95 \times 0.8 = 0.76&lt;/math&gt;

which is lower than either of the individual components.

[[File:Electronic membrane switches.jpg|thumb|Electronic membrane switches]]
A '''membrane switch''' is an electrical switch for turning a circuit on and off. It differs from a mechanical switch, which is usually made of copper and plastic parts: a membrane switch is a circuit printed on [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] or [[Indium tin oxide|ITO]]. The ink used for screen printing is usually [[copper]] / [[silver]] / [[graphite]] filled and therefore conductive.

Membrane switches are user-equipment interface utilities that allow for the communication of commands from users to electronic devices. Membrane switches can be thought of as one category of interface utilities alongside touch screens, plastic keyboards, toggle switches and many other kinds of control systems. Interface utilities can be as simple as tactile switches for controlling lighting, and they can be as complicated as membrane keyboards and switch panels for use with computers. 

==Construction==
The [[ASTM]] defines a membrane switch as "a momentary switch device in which at least one contact is on, or made of, a flexible substrate."

A membrane switch typically has 4 or more layers.  The top layer of a membrane switch is the graphic interface between the user and the machine. The another critical layer is a printed circuit.  This can also be a flex circuit made of copper and polyimide material.   The layers are normally assembled using pressure-sensitive adhesives although inexpensive designs can be held together by other mechanical means such as a keyboard housing.  Contact between two traces can be made through a printed shorting pad or through a metal dome that stands on legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Backlighting Membrane Switches|url=https://www.pannam.com/backlighting/|website=Pannam Imaging}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Backlighting===
There are three standard methods for back lighting membrane switches.  

The first option is using [[Light Emitting Diode]]s (LEDs) to back light.  However, LEDs create bright spots and are not suitable for overall back lighting of a panel, but rather as indicator lights.  LEDs can either be surface mounted to the circuit layer or be placed on a separate LED layer.  

A second option is [[optical fiber]].  In a typical design, two or more layers of woven fiber-optic cloth are used to form a rectangular light-emitting area.  The fibers coming off one end are then bundled into a circular [[ferrule]] and coupled to one or more LED light sources.  Remote light sources offer 10,000 to 100,000 hours of life.  Optical fibers are not affected by extremes in humidity (0% to 100%) or temperature (-40 to + 85 deg C).

The third standard option is to use [[electroluminescent]] (EL) lamps. They are lower priced compared to fiber optics and offer additional design flexibility.  The color of light emitted from an EL lamp can vary depending on the phosphors that are used.  Some common colors are blue/green and yellow/green, white, blue and orange. EL lamps have a half-life of approximately 3000–8000 hours depending upon the quality of the phosphor. Once they reach their half-life, the brightness starts to fade rapidly.  EL lamps are thus not a good choice if the lamp is on for an extended period of time.  Fading or flashing could double the life of the lamp.

==Applications==
Classic applications of membrane switches include [[microwave oven]] panel, [[air conditioner]] control panel, TV [[remote control]] etc. Tactile feedback of keys can be provided by embossing the top PET layer or embedding metal snap domes, polyester domes or forming the graphic layer.

The benefits of membrane switches include ease of cleaning, sealing ability and their low profile. Membrane switch can be used together with other control systems such as touch screens, keyboards, lighting, and they can also be complicated like the membrane keyboards and switch panels in mobiles and computers. They are reliable, effective, low-cost user interfaces, suitable for a wide range of products, and available with many creative options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membrane Switches|url=https://www.ktptechs.com/products/membrane-switches/|website=KTP Techs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on industry and application, membrane switches are also referred to as membrane keyboards and membrane keypads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membrane Switches: The Basics|url=http://www.ssi-electronics.com/products/membrane-switches/|website=SSI Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Centre for Earth Science Studies'''(NCESS) ([[Malayalam]]: ദേശിയ  ഭൂമി ശാസ്ത്ര പഠന കേന്ദ്രം) is an autonomous research centre to promote scientific and technological research and development studies in the [[earth sciences]]. NCESS pursues problems related to land, sea and atmosphere. It was instituted by the government of Kerala in 1978, at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]]. CESS was the earliest institute in the country to embrace the concept of Earth System Science (ESS). CESS contributions over the years have enhanced knowledge of the geological evolution of south India, the complexity of coastal processes and natural hazards, as well as in proposing mitigatory measures to deal with natural hazards.

CESS carries out studies in [[river]] basin evaluation, [[ground water]] management, coastal [[erosion]], and other special problems. 
CESS does research in [[earth]] system, micro-level watershed planning, [[natural hazards]] management, [[chemical analysis]], CRZ mapping, and studies of air, water, land, [[noise pollution]], etc.

CESS also does [[environmental impact assessment]], coastal and [[estuarine]] management, [[terrain]] analysis, natural resources management, laser applications, river [[sand mining]], and microlevel planning. CESS conducts research courses leading to doctoral degree.

Recognizing the growth potential of CESS, resource constraints of the State Government and the role CESS can play in national development, the government of Kerala proposed the taking over of the institute by the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], Government of India. An expert committee made an assessment of the scientific programs pursued by the institute and deliberated on a long term vision for the institute as a national centre. The committee recommended the taking over of CESS by the MoES and according it the status of an autonomous institute under the [[Ministry_of_Earth_Sciences|Earth System Science Organization]] (ESSO) of MoES. The proposed thrust areas of research will be [[earth's crustal evolution|crustal evolution]] and geodynamics, sedimentology and depositional processes, coastal dynamics and cloud microphysics.

The total estimated budget requirements of CESS will be Rs.128.67 crore for the balance period of the 12th FYP.

== Campus ==
The Centre for Earth Science Studies is housed in a 50,000 sq. ft building constructed in a campus of 19 acres. The development of the CESS campus in 1986 saw the transformation of an abandoned clay mining site to a beautiful green campus within one year. The campus was the vision of the founder Director Prof. C. Karunakaran, realised through the leadership of Dr. H. K. Gupta, the then director and Sri M. Sethumadhavan, the then registrar, and Dr S. Satheeschandran Nair.

The CESS building is constructed on natural gradients, slopes and excavated mining areas in a nature friendly architectural design. Buildings are spread as different blocks. Main building houses Administration, Library, Conference Hall and an auditorium. Four interconnected blocks provide seating spaces for scientists. Laboratory block houses main laboratories of all divisions with a centralised access to scientists of all disciplines. A separate building for canteen and guest house is built away from the main buzz of activity. 

The canteen functions from 9 am to 4:30 pm providing Kerala style breakfast and lunch with snacks and tea and coffee. In 2004 a laboratory block was added over the existing block to house new facilities and provide two smaller meeting and discussion halls.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''New Suburbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which intends to improve on existing [[Suburb|suburban]] or [[exurban]] designs.&lt;ref name="The New Suburbanism: A Realist's Guide to the American Future"&gt;[http://www.southbaycities.org/files/12.05%20Kotkin%20New%20Suburbanism%20Report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23290105?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101999752763|title=The Emerging 'Silicon Savanna': From Old Urbanism to New Suburbanism|author=STEPHEN MARSHALL|date=1978|volume=32|pages=267–280|publisher=Alexandrine Press|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barternews.com/new_suburbanism_growing_in_southern_california.htm |title=New Suburbanism Growing In Southern California |publisher=Barternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to [[Personalization|customization]], new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city-center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Paul and Marc Tsurumaki, David J. Lewis.|date=2003|title=New Suburbanism|url=http://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1384&amp;context=oz|journal=Oz|volume=25|pages=34–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suburban sprawl]] is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities. Suburban sprawl continues to grow as over 70% of Americans choose to live in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fannie-Mae-Foundation. ''Downtown housing as an urban redevelopment tool: hope or hype (panel discussion).'' Housing Policy Debate, 10 (1997), pp. 477–505. Retrieved: 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Planners are currently seeking to make the suburbs more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and New Suburbanism offers a solution. This planning approach seeks to redesign suburban communities by making them more-dense, equitable, and environmentally sustainable while still keeping housing and design preferences of the consumer in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkninson-Palombo|first=Carol|date=2010|title=New housing construction in Phoenix: Evidence of "new suburbanism"?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275109001073|journal=Cities|volume=27|pages=77–86|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to New Urbanism==
[[New Urbanism]] is a style of planning a new neighborhood that focuses on designing aspects that create more [[community engagement]], whereas New Suburbanism is the improving of an existing suburban neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

New urbanism, though a small movement, is more successful than New Suburbanism, as NS only has 1 location and NU has hundreds.

'''Plant physiology''' is a subdiscipline of [[botany]] concerned with the functioning, or [[physiology]], of [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992"&gt;{{cite book| author = Frank B. Salisbury|author2=Cleon W. Ross | title = Plant physiology| year = 1992| publisher = Brooks/Cole Pub Co| isbn = 0-534-15162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related fields include [[plant morphology]] (structure of plants), plant [[ecology]] (interactions with the environment), [[phytochemistry]] ([[biochemistry]] of plants), [[cell biology]], genetics, biophysics and [[molecular biology]].

Fundamental processes such as [[photosynthesis]], [[cellular respiration|respiration]], [[plant nutrition]], [[plant hormone]] functions, [[tropism]]s, [[nastic movements]], [[photoperiodism]], [[photomorphogenesis]], [[circadian rhythms]], environmental stress physiology, seed [[germination]], [[dormancy]] and [[stoma]]ta function and [[transpiration]], both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists.

==Aims==
The field of plant physiology includes the study of all the internal activities of plants—those chemical and physical processes associated with [[life]] as they occur in plants.  This includes study at many levels of scale of size and time. At the smallest scale are [[molecule|molecular]] interactions of [[photosynthesis]] and internal [[diffusion]] of water, minerals, and nutrients.  At the largest scale are the processes of plant [[Developmental biology|development]], [[season]]ality, [[dormancy]], and [[reproductive]] control.  Major subdisciplines of plant physiology include [[phytochemistry]] (the study of the [[biochemistry]] of plants) and [[phytopathology]] (the study of [[disease]] in plants). The scope of plant physiology as a discipline may be divided into several major areas of research.

[[Image:Plant physiology.png|thumb|240px|Five key areas of study within plant physiology.]]
First, the study of [[phytochemistry]] (plant chemistry) is included within the domain of plant physiology.  To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms.  [[Photosynthesis]] requires a large array of [[pigment]]s, [[enzyme]]s, and other compounds to function.  Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from [[herbivore]]s, [[pathogen]]s and competition from other plants.  They do this by producing [[toxin]]s and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals.  Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy, while other compounds are used to attract [[pollinator]]s or herbivores to spread ripe seeds.

Secondly, plant physiology includes the study of biological and chemical processes of individual plant [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Plant cells have a number of features that distinguish them from cells of [[animal]]s, and which lead to major differences in the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal life.  For example, plant cells have a [[cell wall]] which restricts the shape of plant cells and thereby limits the flexibility and mobility of plants.  Plant cells also contain [[chlorophyll]], a chemical compound that interacts with [[light]] in a way that enables plants to manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things as animals do.

Thirdly, plant physiology deals with interactions between cells, [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], and organs within a plant.  Different cells and tissues are physically and chemically specialized to perform different functions.  [[Root]]s and [[rhizoid]]s function to anchor the plant and acquire minerals in the soil.  [[Leaf|Leaves]] catch light in order to manufacture nutrients. For both of these organs to remain living, minerals that the roots acquire must be transported to the leaves, and the nutrients manufactured in the leaves must be transported to the roots.  Plants have developed a number of ways to achieve this transport, such as [[vascular tissue]], and the functioning of the various modes of transport is studied by plant physiologists.

Fourthly, plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions.  Like animals, plants produce chemicals called [[plant hormone|hormones]] which are produced in one part of the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond.  Many [[flowering plant]]s bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as [[photoperiodism]].  The [[ripening]] of [[fruit]] and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas [[ethylene]] by the plant.

Finally, plant physiology includes the study of plant response to environmental conditions and their variation, a field known as [[#Environmental physiology|environmental physiology]].  Stress from water loss, changes in air chemistry, or crowding by other plants can lead to changes in the way a plant functions.  These changes may be affected by genetic, chemical, and physical factors.

==Biochemistry of plants==
[[Image:Latex dripping.JPG|thumb|[[Rubber|Latex]] being collected from a [[rubber tapping|tapped]] [[rubber tree]].]]
{{main|Phytochemistry}}

The [[chemical element]]s of which plants are constructed—principally [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], etc.—are the same as for all other life forms animals, fungi, [[bacteria]] and even [[virus]]es.  Only the details of the molecules into which they are assembled differs.

Despite this underlying similarity, plants produce a vast array of chemical compounds with unique properties which they use to cope with their environment.  [[Pigment]]s are used by plants to absorb or detect light, and are extracted by humans for use in [[dye]]s. Other plant products may be used for the manufacture of commercially important [[rubber]] or [[biofuel]].  Perhaps the most celebrated compounds from plants are those with [[pharmacological]] activity, such as [[salicylic acid]] from which [[aspirin]] is made, [[morphine]], and [[digoxin]].  [[Drug company|Drug companies]] spend billions of dollars each year researching plant compounds for potential medicinal benefits.

===Constituent elements===
{{further|Plant nutrition}}

Plants require some [[nutrient]]s, such as [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]], in large quantities to survive.  Some nutrients are termed [[Macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrients]], where the prefix ''macro-'' (large) refers to the quantity needed, not the size of the nutrient particles themselves.  Other nutrients, called [[micronutrient]]s, are required only in trace amounts for plants to remain healthy.  Such micronutrients are usually absorbed as [[ion]]s dissolved in water taken from the soil, though [[carnivorous plant]]s acquire some of their micronutrients from captured prey.

The following tables list [[chemical element|element]] nutrients essential to plants.  Uses within plants are generalized.

=== Pigments ===
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the [[chlorophyll]] molecule.]]
[[Image:orange violet pansies.jpg|thumb|[[Anthocyanin]] gives these [[pansies]] their dark purple pigmentation.]]
{{main|Biological pigment}}

Among the most important molecules for plant function are the [[pigment]]s.  Plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecules, including [[porphyrin]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, and [[anthocyanin]]s.  All [[biological pigment]]s selectively absorb certain [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] while [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] others.  The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power [[chemical reaction]]s, while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the [[color]] the pigment appears to the eye.

[[Chlorophyll]] is the primary pigment in plants; it is a [[porphyrin]] that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting [[green]].  It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color.  All land plants and [[green alga]]e possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll ''a'' and chlorophyll ''b''.  [[Kelp]]s, [[diatom]]s, and other photosynthetic [[heterokont]]s contain chlorophyll ''c'' instead of ''b'',  [[red algae]] possess  chlorophyll ''a''.  All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel [[photosynthesis]].

[[Carotenoid]]s are red, orange, or yellow [[tetraterpenoid]]s.  They function as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel [[photosynthesis]] by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll.  The most familiar carotenoids are [[carotene]] (an orange pigment found in [[carrot]]s), [[lutein]] (a yellow pigment found in fruits and vegetables), and [[lycopene]] (the red pigment responsible for the color of [[tomato]]es).  Carotenoids have been shown to act as [[antioxidant]]s and to promote healthy [[eyesight]] in humans.

[[Anthocyanin]]s  (literally "flower blue") are [[solubility|water-soluble]] [[flavonoid]] [[pigments]] that appear red to blue, according to [[pH]]. They occur in all [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of higher plants, providing color in [[leaf|leaves]], [[plant stem|stems]], [[root]]s, [[flower]]s, and [[fruit]]s, though not always in sufficient quantities to be noticeable. Anthocyanins are most visible in the [[petal]]s of flowers, where they may make up as much as 30% of the dry weight of the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Trevor Robinson| title = The organic constituents of higher plants: their chemistry and interrelationships| year = 1963| publisher = Cordus Press| page = 183  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also responsible for the purple color seen on the underside of tropical shade plants such as ''[[Tradescantia zebrina]]''. In these plants, the anthocyanin catches light that has passed through the leaf and reflects it back towards regions bearing chlorophyll, in order to maximize the use of available light

[[Betalain]]s are red or yellow pigments.  Like anthocyanins they are water-soluble, but unlike anthocyanins they are [[indole]]-derived compounds synthesized from [[tyrosine]].  This class of pigments is found only in the [[Caryophyllales]] (including [[cactus]] and [[amaranth]]), and never co-occur in plants with anthocyanins. Betalains are responsible for the deep red color of [[beet]]s, and are used commercially as food-coloring agents.  Plant physiologists are uncertain of the function that betalains have in plants which possess them, but there is some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Signals and regulators==
[[Image:Auxin.jpg|thumb|A [[mutation]] that stops ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' responding to [[auxin]] causes abnormal growth (right)]]
Plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues.  They also produce compounds such as [[phytochrome]] that are sensitive to light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals.

===Plant hormones===
{{main|Plant hormone}}

[[Plant hormone]]s, known as plant growth regulators (PGRs) or phytohormones, are chemicals that regulate a plant's growth. According to a standard animal definition, [[hormone]]s are signal molecules produced at specific locations, that occur in very low concentrations, and cause altered processes in target cells at other locations. Unlike animals, plants lack specific hormone-producing tissues or organs.  Plant hormones are often not transported to other parts of the plant and production is not limited to specific locations.

Plant hormones are [[chemical]]s that in small amounts promote and influence the [[cell growth|growth]], [[morphogenesis|development]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to [[seed]] development, [[dormancy]], and [[germination]]. They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf [[abscission]] and even plant death.

The most important plant hormones are [[abscissic acid]] (ABA), [[auxin]]s, [[ethylene]], [[gibberellin]]s, and [[cytokinin]]s, though there are many other substances that serve to regulate plant physiology.

===Photomorphogenesis===
{{main|Photomorphogenesis}}

While most people know that [[light]] is important for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant sensitivity to light plays a role in the control of plant structural development ([[morphogenesis]]).  The use of light to control structural development is called [[photomorphogenesis]], and is dependent upon the presence of specialized [[Photopigment|photoreceptors]], which are chemical [[pigment]]s capable of absorbing specific [[wavelength]]s of light.

Plants use four kinds of photoreceptors:&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992" /&gt; [[phytochrome]], [[cryptochrome]], a [[UV-B]] photoreceptor, and [[protochlorophyllide|protochlorophyllide ''a'']].  The first two of these, phytochrome and cryptochrome, are [[photoreceptor protein]]s, complex molecular structures formed by joining a [[protein]] with a light-sensitive pigment.  Cryptochrome is also known as the UV-A photoreceptor, because it absorbs [[ultraviolet]] light in the long wave "A" region.  The UV-B receptor is one or more compounds not yet identified with certainty, though some evidence suggests [[carotene]] or [[riboflavin]] as candidates.&lt;ref name="Fosket 1994"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fosket| first = Donald E.| title = Plant Growth and Development: A Molecular Approach| year = 1994| publisher = Academic Press| location = San Diego| isbn = 0-12-262430-0| pages = 498–509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protochlorophyllide ''a'', as its name suggests, is a chemical precursor of [[chlorophyll]].

The most studied of the photoreceptors in plants is [[phytochrome]].  It is sensitive to light in the [[red]] and [[far-red]] region of the [[visible spectrum]]. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of [[flower]]ing based on the length of day and night ([[photoperiodism]]) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the [[epicotyl]] or [[hypocotyl]] hook of [[dicot]] seedlings.

===Photoperiodism===
[[Image:Poinsettia 2.jpg|thumb|The [[poinsettia]] is a short-day plant, requiring two months of long nights prior to blooming.]]
{{main|Photoperiodism}}

Many [[flowering plant]]s use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in [[day]] length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed [[photoperiodism]]. Broadly speaking, flowering plants can be classified as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length.  Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity ([[vernalization]]) instead.

Although a short day plant cannot flower during the long days of summer, it is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering.  Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin.  It has been determined experimentally that a short day plant (long night) does not flower if a flash of phytochrome activating light is used on the plant during the night.

Plants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod.  This fact is utilized by [[florist]]s and [[greenhouse]] gardeners to control and even induce flowering out of season, such as the ''[[Poinsettia]]''.

==Environmental physiology==
[[Image:Arabidopsis thaliana.jpg|thumb|[[Phototropism]] in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is regulated by blue to UV light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantphys.net/article.php?id=266 plantphys.net]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Ecophysiology}}

Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of environmental physiology is on the one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology and on the other hand one of the oldest.&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992" /&gt; Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with [[ecophysiology]], crop ecology, [[horticulture]] and [[agronomy]]. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of [[ecology]].

Environmental physiologists examine plant response to physical factors such as [[radiation]] (including [[light]] and [[ultraviolet]] radiation), [[temperature]], [[fire]], and [[wind]]. Of particular importance are [[water]] relations (which can be measured with the [[Pressure bomb]]) and the stress of [[drought]] or [[flood|inundation]], exchange of gases with the [[atmosphere]], as well as the cycling of nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]].

Environmental physiologists also examine plant response to biological factors.  This includes not only negative interactions, such as [[competition (biology)|competition]], [[herbivory]], [[disease]] and [[parasitism]], but also positive interactions, such as [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[pollination]].

===Tropisms and nastic movements===
{{main|Tropism|Nastic movement}}

Plants may respond both to directional and non-directional [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].  A response to a directional stimulus, such as [[gravity]] or sun[[light]], is called a tropism.  A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as [[temperature]] or [[humidity]], is a nastic movement.

[[Tropism]]s in plants are the result of differential [[cell (biology)|cell]] growth, in which the cells on one side of the plant elongates more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth.  Among the common tropisms seen in plants is [[phototropism]], the bending of the plant toward a source of light.  Phototropism allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. [[Geotropism]] allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards.  Tropisms generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones.

[[Nastic movement]]s results from differential cell growth (e.g. epinasty and hiponasty), or from changes in [[turgor pressure]] within plant tissues (e.g., [[nyctinasty]]), which may occur rapidly.  A familiar example is [[thigmonasty]] (response to touch) in the [[Venus fly trap]], a [[carnivorous plant]].  The traps consist of modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger hairs. When the hairs are touched by an insect or other animal, the leaf folds shut.  This mechanism allows the plant to trap and digest small insects for additional nutrients.  Although the trap is rapidly shut by changes in internal cell pressures, the leaf must grow slowly to reset for a second opportunity to trap insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Adrian Charles Slack|author2=Jane Gate | title = Carnivorous Plants| year = 1980| publisher = Cambridge, Massachusetts : MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-19186-9| page = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant disease===
[[Image:Powdery mildew.JPG|thumb|[[Powdery mildew]] on crop leaves]]
{{main|Phytopathology}}

Economically, one of the most important areas of research in environmental physiology is that of [[phytopathology]], the study of [[disease]]s in plants and the manner in which plants resist or cope with infection.  Plant are susceptible to the same kinds of disease organisms as animals, including [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]], as well as physical invasion by [[insect]]s and [[roundworm]]s.

Because the biology of plants differs with animals, their symptoms and responses are quite different.  In some cases, a plant can simply shed infected leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of disease, in a process called abscission.  Most animals do not have this option as a means of controlling disease.  Plant diseases organisms themselves also differ from those causing disease in animals because plants cannot usually spread infection through casual physical contact.  Plant [[pathogen]]s tend to spread via [[spore]]s or are carried by animal [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].

One of the most important advances in the control of plant disease was the discovery of [[Bordeaux mixture]] in the nineteenth century.  The mixture is the first known [[fungicide]] and is a combination of [[copper sulfate]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]].  Application of the mixture served to inhibit the growth of [[downy mildew]] that threatened to seriously damage the [[France|French]] [[wine]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kingsley Rowland Stern|author2=Shelley Jansky | title = Introductory Plant Biology| year = 1991| publisher = WCB/McGraw-Hill| isbn = 978-0-697-09948-8| page = 309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of botany}}

===Early history===
[[Image:Portrait of J.B. van Helmont, Aufgang...1683 Wellcome L0003194.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].]]
Sir [[Francis Bacon]] published one of the first plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, ''Sylva Sylvarum.'' Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] published experiments on growth of [[spearmint]] in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.

[[Stephen Hales]] is considered the Father of Plant Physiology for the many experiments in the 1727 book;&lt;ref&gt;Hales, Stephen. 1727. ''Vegetable Staticks'' http://www.illustratedgarden.org/mobot/rarebooks/title.asp?relation=QK711H341727&lt;/ref&gt; though
[[Julius von Sachs]] unified the pieces of plant physiology and put them together as a discipline. His ''Lehrbuch der Botanik'' was the plant physiology bible of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Duane Isely| title = 101 Botanists| year = 1994| publisher = Iowa State Press| isbn = 978-0-8138-2498-7| pages = 216–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers discovered in the 1800s that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic ions in water. In natural conditions, soil acts as a mineral nutrient reservoir but the soil itself is not essential to plant growth. When the mineral nutrients in the soil are dissolved in water, plant roots absorb nutrients readily, soil is no longer required for the plant to thrive. This observation is the basis for [[hydroponics]], the growing of plants in a water solution rather than soil, which has become a standard technique in biological research, teaching lab exercises, crop production and as a hobby.

===Current research===
One of the leading journals in the field is ''[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]]'', started in 1926. All its back issues are available online for free.[http://www.plantphysiol.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml] Many other journals often carry plant physiology articles, including ''Physiologia Plantarum'', ''Journal of Experimental Botany'', ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'', ''Annals of Botany'', ''Journal of Plant Nutrition'' and ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].''

==Economic applications==

=== Food production ===
{{further|Agriculture|Horticulture}}

In [[horticulture]] and [[agriculture]] along with [[food science]], plant physiology is an important topic relating to [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, and other consumable parts of plants.  Topics studied include: ''climatic'' requirements, fruit drop, nutrition, [[ripening]], fruit set.  The production of food crops also hinges on the study of plant physiology covering such topics as optimal planting and harvesting times and post harvest storage of plant products for human consumption and the production of secondary products like drugs and cosmetics.

G., Statham, H., Hackett, G. A., Jessop, F. A., &amp; Less, C.C. (2012). Perinatal postmortems: What is important to parents and how do they decide?. Birth: Issues In Perinatal Care, 39(1), 57-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1523-536X.2011.00513.x&lt;/ref&gt; Postmortem researchers conduct a [[longitudinal study]] of the brain of an individual, who has some sort of phenomenological affliction (i.e. cannot speak, trouble moving left side of body, Alzheimer's, etc.) that is examined after death. Researchers look at certain lesions in the brain that could have an influence on cognitive or motor functions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; Sternberg, K. (2012).Cognitive Psychology (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning.
&lt;/ref&gt; These irregularities, damage, or other cerebral anomalies observed in the brain are attributed to an individual’s pathophysiology and their environmental surroundings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Yehuda, R. (2004). Commentary on ‘Brain Environment Interactions: Stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the need for a postmortem brain collection’: Understanding heterogeneous effects of trauma exposure: Relevance to postmortem studies of PTSD. Psychiatry: Interpersonal And Biological Processes, 67(4), 391-397. doi:10.1521/psyc.67.4.391.5672
&lt;/ref&gt; Postmortem studies provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study different brain attributes that would be unable to be studied on a living person.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;McCullumsmith, R. E., &amp; Meador-Woodruff, J. H. (2011). Novel approaches to the study of postmortem brain in psychiatric illness: Old limitations and new challenges. Biological Psychiatry, 69(2), 127-133. doi:10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.09.035
&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmortem studies allow researchers to determine causes and cure for certain diseases and functions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is critical for researchers to develop hypotheses, in order to discover the characteristics that are meaningful to a particular disorder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The results that the researcher discovers from the study will help the researcher trace the location in the brain to specific behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When tissue from a postmortem study is obtained it is imperative that the researcher ensures the quality is adequate to study. This is specifically important when an individual is researching gene expression (i.e. DNA, RNA, and proteins). Some key ways researchers monitor the quality are by determining the pain level/time of death of the individual, pH of the tissue, refrigeration time and temperature of storage, time until the brain tissue is frozen, and the thawing conditions. As well as finding out specific information about the individual’s life such as: age, sex, legal/illegal substance use, and a treatment analysis of the individual.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Pidsley, R., &amp; Mill, J. (2011). Epigenetic studies of psychosis: Current findings, methodological approaches, and implications for postmortem research. Biological Psychiatry, 69(2), 146-156. doi:10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.03.029&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Postmortem studies have been used to further the understanding of the brain for centuries. Before the time of the [[MRI]], [[CAT Scan]], or [[X-ray]] it was one of the few ways to study the relation between behavior and the brain.

[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|300px|Approximate location of Broca's and Wernicke's areas highlighted in gray]]

===Broca===
[[Paul Broca]] used postmortem studies to link a specific area of the brain with speech production.

His research began when he noticed that a patient with an [[aphasic]] stroke had [[lesions]] in the left hemisphere of his brain.  His research and theory continued over time.

The most notable of his research subjects was Tan (named for the only syllable he could utter). Tan had lesions in his brain caused by syphilis. These lesions were determined to cover the area of his brain that was important for speech production.

The area of the brain that Broca identified is now known as [[Broca's area]]; damage to this section of the brain can lead to [[Expressive aphasia]].

===Wernicke===
[[Karl Wernicke]] also used postmortem studies to link specific areas of the brain with speech production. However his research focused more on patients who could speak, however their speech made little sense and/or had trouble understanding spoken words or sentences.

His research in language comprehension and the brain also found it to be localized in the left hemisphere, but in a different section. This area is known as [[Wernicke's area]]; damage to this section can lead to [[Receptive aphasia]].

==Benefits==
Postmortem studies allows for researchers to give information that is relevant to individuals by explaining the causes of particular diseases and behaviors. This is in hopes that others can avoid some of these experiences in the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Postmortem studies also improve medical knowledge and help to determine whether changes happen in the brain itself or in the actual disorder. By doing this researchers are then able to help prioritize experimental studies and integrate the studies into animal and cell research.  Another benefit to postmortem studies is that researchers have the ability to make a wide range of discoveries, because of the many different techniques used to obtain tissue samples. Postmortem studies are extremely important and unique despite their limitations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Harrison, P. J. (2011). Using our brains: The findings, flaws, and future of postmortem studies of psychiatric disorders. Biological Psychiatry, 69(2), 102-103. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.09.009
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Postmortem brain samples are limited resources, because it is extremely difficult for a researcher to get a hold of an individual’s brain. The researchers ask their participants or the families to consent to allowing them to study the loved ones brain, however there has been a falling rates of consent in the last few years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently researchers have to use indirect methods to study the locations and processes of the brain.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another limitation to postmortem studies is the continuous funding and the time it takes to conduct a longitudinal study. Postmortem longitudinal studies usually take place at the time of assessment until the time of death about 20–30 years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In [[computer science]], the '''readers-writers problems''' are examples of a common computing problem in [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. There are at least three variations of the problems, which deal with situations in which many [[thread (computer science)|thread]]s try to access the same shared resource at one time. Some threads may read and some may write, with the constraint that no process may access the shared resource for either reading or writing while another process is in the act of writing to it. (In particular, it ''is'' allowed for two or more readers to access the share at the same time.) A [[readers-writer lock]] is a [[data structure]] that solves one or more of the readers-writers problems.

The basic reader-writers problem was first formulated and solved by Courtois ''et al.''{{r|courtois}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Synchronization Algorithms and Concurrent Programming |first=Gadi |last=Taubenfeld |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2006 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ex: Suppose in a class there is one board,where only one person can write at a time, but at the same time many readers can read the board

==First readers-writers problem==
Suppose we have a shared memory area with the basic constraints detailed above. It is possible to protect the shared data behind a mutual exclusion [[mutex]], in which case no two threads can access the data at the same time. However, this solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' might have the lock, and then another reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' requests access. It would be foolish for ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to wait until ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' was done before starting its own read operation; instead, ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' should be allowed to read the resource alongside ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' because reads don't modify data, so concurrent reads are safe. This is the motivation for the '''first readers-writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no reader shall be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for reading.''  This is also called '''readers-preference''', with its solution:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
semaphore resource=1;
semaphore rmutex=1;
readcount=0;

/*
   resource.P() is equivalent to wait(resource)
   resource.V() is equivalent to signal(resource)
   rmutex.P() is equivalent to wait(rmutex)
   rmutex.V() is equivalent to signal(rmutex)
*/

writer() {
    resource.P();          //Lock the shared file for a writer

    &lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
    // Writing is done

    &lt;EXIT Section&gt;
    resource.V();          //Release the shared file for use by other readers. Writers are allowed if there are no readers requesting it.
}

reader() {
    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the &lt;Entry&gt; section while you are in it
    &lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
    readcount++;          //Indicate that you are a reader trying to enter the Critical Section
    if (readcount == 1)   //Checks if you are the first reader trying to enter CS
        resource.P();     //If you are the first reader, lock the resource from writers. Resource stays reserved for subsequent readers
    &lt;EXIT CRITICAL Section&gt;
    rmutex.V();           //Release

    // Do the Reading

    rmutex.P();           //Ensure that no other reader can execute the &lt;Exit&gt; section while you are in it
    &lt;CRITICAL Section&gt;
    readcount--;          //Indicate that you are no longer needing the shared resource. One fewer reader
    if (readcount == 0)   //Checks if you are the last (only) reader who is reading the shared file
        resource.V();     //If you are last reader, then you can unlock the resource. This makes it available to writers.
    &lt;EXIT CRITICAL Section&gt;
    rmutex.V();           //Release
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this solution of the readers/writers problem, the first reader must lock the resource (shared file) if such is available. Once the file is locked from writers, it may be used by many subsequent readers without having them to re-lock it again.

Before entering the [[critical section]], every new reader must go through the entry section. However, there may only be a single reader in the entry section at a time. This is done to avoid race conditions on the readers (e.g. two readers increment the readcount at the same time, and both try to lock the resource, causing one reader to block). To accomplish this, every reader which enters the &lt;ENTRY Section&gt; will lock the &lt;ENTRY Section&gt; for themselves until they are done with it. At this point the readers are not locking the resource. They are only locking the entry section so no other reader can enter it while they are in it. Once the reader is done executing the entry section, it will unlock it by signalling the mutex. Signalling it is equivalent to: mutex.V() in the above code. Same  is valid for the &lt;EXIT Section&gt;. There can be no more than a single reader in the exit section at a time, therefore, every reader must claim and lock the Exit section for themselves before using it.

Once the first reader is in the entry section, it will lock the resource. Doing this will prevent any writers from accessing it. Subsequent readers can just utilize the locked (from writers) resource. The very last reader (indicated by the readcount variable) must unlock the resource, thus making it available to writers.

In this solution, every writer must claim the resource individually. This means that a stream of readers can subsequently lock all potential writers out and starve them. This is so, because after the first reader locks the resource, no writer can lock it, before it gets released. And it will only be released by the very last reader. Hence, this solution does not satisfy fairness.

==Second readers-writers problem==
The first solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' might have the lock, a writer ''W'' be waiting for the lock, and then a reader ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' requests access. It would be unfair for ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to jump in immediately, ahead of ''W''; if that happened often enough, ''W'' would [[resource starvation|starve]]. Instead, ''W'' should start as soon as possible. This is the motivation for the '''second readers-writers problem''', in which the constraint is added that ''no writer, once added to the queue, shall be kept waiting longer than absolutely necessary''. This is also called '''writers-preference'''.

A solution to the writers-preference scenario is:&lt;ref name="courtois"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |title=Concurrent Control with "Readers" and "Writers" |first1=P. J. |last1=Courtois |first2=F. |last2=Heymans |first3=D. L. |last3=Parnas |year=1971 |url=http://cs.nyu.edu/~lerner/spring10/MCP-S10-Read04-ReadersWriters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;

semaphore rmutex, wmutex, readTry, resource; //(initial value = 1)

  readcount++;                 //report yourself as a reader

    resource.P();              //if you are first reader, lock  the resource

&lt;EXIT Section&gt;
  wmutex.P();                  //reserve exit section
  writecount--;                //indicate you're leaving
  if (writecount == 0)         //checks if you're the last writer
    readTry.V();               //if you're last writer, you must unlock the readers. Allows them to try enter CS for reading
  wmutex.V();                  //release exit section
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this solution, preference is given to the writers. This is accomplished by forcing every reader to lock and release the readtry semaphore individually. The writers on the other hand don't need to lock it individually. Only the first writer will lock the readtry and then all subsequent writers can simply use the resource as it gets freed by the previous writer. The very last writer must release the readtry semaphore, thus opening the gate for readers to try reading.

No reader can engage in the entry section if the readtry semaphore has been set by a writer previously. The reader must wait for the last writer to unlock the resource and readtry semaphores. On the other hand, if a particular reader has locked the readtry semaphore, this will indicate to any potential concurrent writer that there is a reader in the entry section. So the writer will wait for the reader to release the readtry and then the writer will immediately lock it for itself and all subsequent writers. However, the writer will not be able to access the resource until the current reader has released the resource, which only occurs after the reader is finished with the resource in the critical section.

The resource semaphore can be locked by both the writer and  the reader in their entry section. They are only able to do so after first locking the readtry semaphore, which can only be done by one of them at a time.

If there are no writers wishing to get to the resource, as indicated to the reader by the status of the readtry semaphore, then the readers will not lock the resource. This is done to allow a writer to immediately take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is finished reading. Otherwise, the writer would need to wait for a queue of readers to be done before the last one can unlock the readtry semaphore. As soon as a writer shows up, it will try to set the readtry and hang up there waiting for the current reader to release the readtry. It will then take control over the resource as soon as the current reader is done reading and lock all future readers out. All subsequent readers will hang up at the readtry semaphore waiting for the writers to be finished with the resource and to open the gate by releasing readtry.

The rmutex and wmutex are used in exactly the same way as in the first solution. Their sole purpose is to avoid race conditions on the readers and writers while they are in their entry or exit sections.

==Third readers-writers problem==
In fact, the solutions implied by both problem statements can result in starvation &amp;mdash; the first one may starve writers in the queue, and the second one may starve readers. Therefore, the '''third readers-writers problem''' is sometimes proposed, which adds the constraint that ''no thread shall be allowed to starve''; that is, the operation of obtaining a lock on the shared data will always terminate in a bounded amount of time.
A solution with fairness for both readers and writers might be as follows:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
int readCount;                  // init to 0; number of readers currently accessing resource

// all semaphores initialised to 1
Semaphore resourceAccess;       // controls access (read/write) to the resource
Semaphore readCountAccess;      // for syncing changes to shared variable readCount
Semaphore serviceQueue;         // FAIRNESS: preserves ordering of requests (signaling must be FIFO)

void writer()
{
    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced
    // &lt;ENTER&gt;
    resourceAccess.P();         // request exclusive access to resource
    // &lt;/ENTER&gt;
    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced
    
    // &lt;WRITE&gt;
    writeResource();            // writing is performed
    // &lt;/WRITE&gt;
    
    // &lt;EXIT&gt;
    resourceAccess.V();         // release resource access for next reader/writer
    // &lt;/EXIT&gt;
}

void reader()
{
    serviceQueue.P();           // wait in line to be serviced
    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount
    // &lt;ENTER&gt;
    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers already reading:
        resourceAccess.P();     // request resource access for readers (writers blocked)
    readCount++;                // update count of active readers
    // &lt;/ENTER&gt;
    serviceQueue.V();           // let next in line be serviced
    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount
    
    // &lt;READ&gt;
    readResource();             // reading is performed
    // &lt;/READ&gt;
    
    readCountAccess.P();        // request exclusive access to readCount
    // &lt;EXIT&gt;
    readCount--;                // update count of active readers
    if (readCount == 0)         // if there are no readers left:
        resourceAccess.V();     // release resource access for all
    // &lt;/EXIT&gt;
    readCountAccess.V();        // release access to readCount
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note also that this solution can only satisfy the condition that "no thread shall be allowed to starve" if and only if semaphores preserve first-in first-out ordering when blocking and releasing threads. Otherwise, a blocked writer, for example, may remain blocked indefinitely with a cycle of other writers decrementing the semaphore before it can.

=== Simplest Reader Writer Problem ===

The simplest reader writer problem which uses only two semaphores and doesn't need an array of readers to read the data in buffer.

Please notice that this solution gets simpler than the general case because it is made equivalent to the [[Producer–consumer problem|Bounded buffer]] problem, and therefore only N readers are allowed to enter in parallel, N being the size of the buffer.

==== Reader ====

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
do {
	wait(read)
	............
	reading data
	............
	signal(write)
} while(TRUE);
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Writer ====

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
do {
	wait(write)
	.............
	writing data
	.............
	signal(read)
} while(TRUE);
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Algorithm ====

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
1. Reader will run after Writer because of read semaphore.
2. Writer will stop writing when the write semaphore has reached 0.
3. Reader will stop reading when the read semaphore has reached 0.
&lt;/source&gt;
In writer, the value of write semaphore is given to read semaphore and in reader, the value of read is given to write on completion of the loop.

[[File:Single RCBR module.JPG|thumb|A single RCBR module]]

The '''rotating cell biofilm reactor (RCBR)''' is a new type of biological process based on [[biofilm]] active sludge used in [[Wastewater treatment|wastewaters treatment]]. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of [[rotating biological contactors]] plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of rotating biological contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using – instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree – many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented by the fact that the biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.

The intrinsic message of this technology is obvious: ''“transform a waste into a resource for the environment”''.

After a first settling and/or screening treatment, wastewaters to be treated (civil, industrial, domestic) are pumped into RCBR modules. By the wastewaters contact, plastic caps are covered by a bacterial biological film. Bacteria are nourished by the organic substance dissolved into the water, purifying it. Purified waters can be drained on a surface body water or on the ground. If they are conveniently disinfected and complementing the modules with a tertiary depuration plant, these waters can be used to irrigate, to full the toilets, to wash objects and streets.

[[File:RCBR core component.JPG|thumb|RCBR rotating cell containing bacterial carriers]]

== Functioning ==
A stainless steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1–3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, where there are wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, [[Heterotrophic microorganism|heterotrophic]] bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] concentration and then the development of [[Autotrophic nutrition|autotrophic]] bacteria. They belong to the [[nitrosomonas]] and [[nitrobacter]] category and they are able to oxidize ammonium, transforming it into [[nitrites]] and [[nitrates]].
The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters [[denitrification]]. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation – alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere – to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.

[[File:Combined RCBR Modules.JPG|thumb|Two combined RCBR modules]]

== Configuration ==
RCBR technology is an entirely water biological treatment system, able to make more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium [[nitrification]]. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).

== Consumption and maintenance ==
This biofilm system does not need any blower to oxygenate the bacteria colonies. It's the simple cell rotation to produce the oxygenation by simple diffusion. The energetic costs of this technology are really cheap and they are related only to the rotational movement impressed by an electric engine to the reaction cell, to maintain the device in a slow movement. The application of RCBR technology generally gets a reduction of the 90% of the water treatment electrical costs, with a medium consumption of 0.25 kWh per cubic meter of purified water.
RCBR's low consumption makes very easy to match these plants with renewable energy, like photovoltaic or aeolian plants. RCBR devices'  mechanical plant does not need any important operations of routine maintenance or any specialized technical expertise to control their operation. In fact, just the common greasing of the cell supporting rotation is requested.

== The invention ==
RCBR is an invention of Italian chemist Sergio Modenese. The first patent of the RCBR technology was registered in July 2013, by an innovative startup from Trentino Alto Adige, of whom the inventor is one of the founder partners.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Collecting seaweed can be traced back to at least the 17th century with the pressings found in [[Sir Hans Sloane|Hans Sloane]]'s Herbarium.&lt;ref name=SloaneHerbarium&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/botanical-collections/sloane-herbarium/ |title=The Sir Hans Sloane Herbarium |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastime became increasingly popular during the [[Victorian era#Entertainment|Victorian Era]], where it played to the burgeoning interest in [[natural history]] and collection in general.

A '''secondary city''' often follows after a [[primate city]] and can be seen in the [[urban hierarchy]].
Secondary cities have between “500,000 to 3 million inhabitants, but are often unknown outside of their national or regional context. Many secondary cities in the [[Global South]] are expected to undergo massive expansions in the next few decades, comparable to city growth in Europe and North America over the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Brillembourg &amp; Hubert Klumpner, "[http://www.nsl.ethz.ch/index.php/content/view/full/2582 Gran Horizonte: Taking a Walk in the Urban Planet]", Network City and Landscape. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"A secondary city is largely determined by population, size, function, and economic status. Commonly, secondary cities are geographically defined urban jurisdictions or centres performing vital governance, logistical, and production functions at a sub-national or sub-metropolitan region level within a system of cities in a country. In some cases, their role and functions may expand to a geographic region of the global realm. The population of secondary-cities range between 10 and 50% of a country's largest city, although some can be smaller than this. They will likely constitute a sub-national or sub-metropolitan second-tier level of government, acting as centres for public administration and delivery of education, knowledge, health, community, and security services; an industrial centre or development growth pole; a new national capital; or a large city making up a cluster of smaller cities in a large metropolitan region."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014&gt;Roberts B. and Hohmann R. (2014), [http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CIVIS%20SECONDARY%20CITIES_Final.pdf The Systems of Secondary Cities - The neglected drivers of urbanizing economies], CIVIS #7, Cities Alliance: Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, secondary cities “usually form more recent poles of growth, often also with a more diffuse genealogy, than larger metropoles. The ambivalent situation of these towns (in the periphery of the center and in the center of the periphery, in so far as these notions still retain their meaning) generates a particular, and by definition highly hybrid, socio-cultural urban dynamic which in turn influences the outlook of social, political and economic life in the more visible national metropoles.”&lt;ref&gt;Ann Cassiman, Filip De Boeck, Steven Van Wolputte,(2009, September), ''Recentering the City: An Anthropology of Secondary Cities in Africa.'' Institute for Anthropological Research in Africa (IARA), University of Leuven, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary cities have their own socio-economic and political culture that may differ from other cities such as Primate cites. Moreover, in the '''secondary city''' (and more generally in the margin of the state) there often is more room for improvisation. Local commerce, trading routes and smuggling networks determine the economic sphere in important ways; local forms of associational life (the middle ground of ‘civil society’) has a far greater influence on local politics than is the case in larger urban centers, and the functioning of local, decentralized political authorities is often shaped and cross-cut to a far greater extent by constantly shifting alliances between local stakeholders.”&lt;ref&gt;Dennis A. Rondinelli, "Dynamics of Growth of Secondary Cities in Developing Countries". In ''Geographical Review'', American Geographical Society, '''Vol. 73''', No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
According to [[UN-HABITAT]], "slum population now expands annually by 25 million. In 1950 there were 86 cities in the world with a population over one million, today there are 400, and by 2015, there will be at least 550."&lt;ref&gt;UN Population Division,''[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2007/2007WUP_Highlights_web.pdf World urbanization prospects]'', 2007 Revision, New York 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, cities have absorbed nearly two-thirds of the global population explosion since 1950 and are currently growing by a million babies and migrants each week.&lt;ref&gt;''Population information program, population reports: meeting the urban challenge,'' '''Vol. xxx''', No. 4, fall 2002, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, countries like India are developing secondary cities to absorb informals—as India's chief economic planner, Montek singh Ahluwalia in 2007, observes: "One hundred million people are moving to cities in the next 10 years, and it’s important that these 100 million are absorbed into second-tier cities instead of showing up in Delhi or Mumbai."&lt;ref&gt;Anand Giridharadas,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/world/asia/13nagpur.html?_r=0 Second Tier’ City to Rise Fast Under India’s Urban Plan]", New York Times, May 13, 2007. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, where primary cities long monopolized growth, secondary cities like Tijuana, Curitiba, Temuco, Salvador and Belem are now booming, "with the fastest growth of all occurring cities with between 100,000 and 500,000 inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel villa and Jorge Rodriguez, "Demographic trends in Latin America’s metropolises,1950-1990", in Alan Gilbert, ''The mega-city in Latin America'', Tokyo 1996, pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, China "may still be under the radar for many westerners but China's second and third-level cities will rise in profile over the next few years."&lt;ref&gt;The Travel and Expense News Source, [http://www.berteloot.com/2013/02/02/special-report-chinas-secondary-cities/ "Special Report: China's Secondary Cities"], February 2, 2013. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; New city developments by governments and other organizations are now focusing on secondary cities. Sociologist [[Saskia Sassen]] suggests that “small cities can be a global platform for companies' global expansion.”&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/23/cities-world-ten-forbeslife-cx_mw_1023cities.html World's Next Great Cities]", Forbes, October 23, 2010. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in China, "[t]he world's top hotel companies are clambering to open properties in China's second- and third-tier cities across all their brands. The sheer size of even tertiary cities, coupled with the growth in domestic travel and the potential gains of modern, international meeting facilities, has led to hotel development at unprecedented levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cei.asia/Article/308459,big-hotel-openings-in-chinas-secondary-cities.aspx Big Hotel openings in China's Secondary Cities], CEI Asia, July 12, 2012. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These new developments are tying to integrate secondary cities into the global and local economy as well from the examples that are seen from China. Another development is that [[China Eastern Airlines]] has increased its number of flights to secondary cities in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesstraveller.asia/asia-pacific/news/china-eastern-linking-up-secondary-chinese-cities China Eastern links secondary Chinese cities], ''Business Traveller'', November 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
According to the World Bank, secondary Cities make up almost 40% of the world cities population. Nearly two-thirds of these are located in Africa and Asia: "They form an important part of an emerging global system of cities."&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, ''Systems of Cities Integrating National and Local Policies Connecting Institutions and Infrastructures.'' 2009, World Bank: Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; While the large cities play a significant role in shaping the new economic geography of cities in fostering global trade, travel and investment, it is secondary cities which will have a much stronger influence in the future upon the economic development of countries."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014a&gt;Roberts B. and Hohmann R. (2014), [https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2014/index.php/Roberts-348_paper.doc?page=downloadPaper&amp;filename=Roberts-348_paper.doc&amp;form_id=348&amp;form_version=final Secondary Cities: Managing Urban Land Governance Systems].

===Categories===
Secondary cities fall into three categories or typologies:

# Sub-national cities being centres of local government, industry, agriculture, tourism and mining; 
# City cluster development associated with expanded, satellite and new town cities which surround large urban metropolitan regions, and; 
# Economic trade corridors which are urban growth centre or poles planned or developing along major transport corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts B. (2014) The Systems of Secondary Cities. Definition, Trends and Policy Responses in International Development. Cities Alliance: Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

"While the industrial revolution and 20th century national self-sufficiency industrialization policies, were to have a profound impact in shaping the development of countries, the current thrust of globalization is changing the dynamics and development of cities, especially developing cities, in ways few would have envisaged half a century ago. There is now growing levels of functional specialization and linkages occurring within the system of secondary cities. The new economic geography has increased competition in small, medium sized cities from international producers and markets. Growing specialization of production systems, supply chains, SMART logistics and inter-modal transfer systems, and the externalization of decision making by expanded consultation, decision-making and investment decisions well outside local government jurisdictions."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014a/&gt; If the efficiency of secondary cities were to improve this could double or triple the GDP of many poor cities and rural regions. In the countries where there is a less distorted system of secondary cities, countries that are not dominated by one mega city, there is generally lower levels of regional development disparities, higher levels of national productivity and income per capita"&lt;ref&gt;Roberts B. (2014), "System of Secondary Cities: Why they are Important to the Sustainable Development of Nations and Regions", Power Point presentation for the Networking Event: Secondary Cities- Key Links for Equitable and Sustainable City Systems organised by Cities Alliance and IADB at the WUF 7 in Medellin&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32861">'''Section 504''' of the '''[[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]''', Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 394 (Sept. 26, 1973), codified at {{usc|29|701}} et seq., is [[United States|American]] [[legislation]] that guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities. It was one of the first U.S. federal civil rights laws offering protection for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://dredf.org/504site/histover.html| first= Kitty| last= Cone|title=Short History of the 504 Sit in| website= dredf.org| publisher= Disability Rights Education &amp; Defense Fund| access-date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set precedents for subsequent legislation for people with disabilities, including the Virginians with Disabilities Act in 1985 and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] in 1990.

==Summary of the Section==
Section 504 states (in part):

&lt;blockquote&gt;No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the [[United States Postal Service]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is codified as 29 U.S.C. 794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/794- |title= 29 U.S. Code § 794 - Nondiscrimination under federal grants and programs| website= law.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As amended in 1974, Section 111, Pub L. 93-516, 88 Stat. 1619 (Dec. 7, 1974), ''Individuals with Disabilities'' are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person who (a) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (b) has a record of such an impairment, or (c) is regarded as having such an impairment&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where

&lt;blockquote&gt;Major life activities include caring for one's self, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, working, performing manual tasks, and learning.&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Health&amp;Human Services"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dhhs.gov/ocr/504.html| publisher= Office for Civil Rights, US Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services| deadurl= yes| title= Your Rights Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act |date= June 2000 |edition= June 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317090828/http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/factsheets/504.pdf| archivedate= March 17, 2015| website= DHHS.gov| access-date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, "For purposes of employment", ''Qualified Individuals with Disabilities'' must also meet "normal and essential eligibility requirements", such that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For purposes of employment, ''Qualified Individuals with Disabilities'' are persons who, with ''Reasonable Accommodation'', can perform the essential functions of the job for which they have applied or have been hired to perform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Reasonable Accommodation'' means an employer is required to take reasonable steps to accommodate [one's] disability unless it would cause the employer undue hardship.&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Health&amp;Human Services" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, ''Qualified Individuals with Disabilities'' must be able to perform the job duties associated with the job for which they would be hired. The [[United States Department of Labor]] also indicates that "Small Providers" do not have to make "''significant'' structural alterations to their existing facilities" to accommodate individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm|title= Section 504, Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 701) |publisher= Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, US Dept. of Labor|work=dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) was passed in 1990, and seems to pick up where the Rehabilitation Act left off. Borrowing from the §504 definition of disabled person, and using the familiar three-pronged approach to eligibility (has a physical or mental impairment, a record of an impairment, or is regarded as having an impairment), the ADA applied those standards to most private sector businesses, and sought to eliminate barriers to disabled access in buildings, transportation, and communication. To a large degree, the passage of the ADA supplants the employment provisions of §504, reinforces the accessibility requirements of §504 with more specific regulations".&lt;ref Name="David M. Richards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.504idea.org/504overview.html#I |title= Overview| first= David M. |last= Richards| publisher= Council of Educators for Students with Disabilities; Richards Lindsay &amp; Martin, L.L.P.| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050204051533/http://www.504idea.org/504overview.html |archivedate= February 4, 2005| access-date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Implications ==
Section 504 covers "any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." If an organization receives federal support of any kind, even if the organization is not a federal or state organization, the organization must comply with Section 504. For example, airports in the United States can be at least partially funded by grants from federal and state governments, thus must be compliant. In many communities, public libraries receive federal financial assistance, directly or indirectly, so they must comply as well. Airports and public libraries became accessible according to Section 504 stipulation within a few years of the implementation of Section 504.

== Requirements for educational programs ==

===Higher education ===
The intention of Section 504 was to impact employment of people with disabilities, thus included education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973: Prohibiting Discrimination Against Individuals with Disabilities in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Assistance|url=http://www.llsdc.org/assets/sourcebook/crs-rl34041.pdf|website=Law Librarians' Society|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 504 was the first national civil rights legislation that provided equal access for students with disabilities to higher education institutions receiving federal financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=L.M.|last2=Belch|first2=H.A.|title=Setting the context: Reconsidering the principles of full participation and meaningful access for students with disabilities|journal=New Directions for Student Services|date=2000|volume=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both public and private colleges and universities supported by federal grants and funding programs must comply with Section 504. The common way higher education institutions are linked to federal funds is through the federal student aid programs. Initially, colleges, universities, and community colleges complied with the regulations imposed by Section 504 in the late-1970s and early to mid-1980s.

Higher education institutions are required to make their programs accessible to qualified students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor|first1=D.J.|title=Helping students with disabilities transition to college: 21 times for students with LD and/or ADD/ADHD|journal=TEACHING Exceptional Children|date=2012|volume=44|issue=5|pages=16–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified students with disabilities are determined by the admissions criteria of the individual higher education institution. Students wishing to receive accommodations must initiate the process, which varies per higher education institution. This process largely subscribes to the [[medical model of disability]], as many higher education institutions require medical documentation of diagnosis and functioning regarding the disability during the accommodation application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=W|title=College student with disabilities: A student development perspective|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|date=2011|volume=154|issue=Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These colleges and universities are required to make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities who attend their institutions.

=== K–12 schools ===
The law also pertains to any "local educational agency (as defined in section 8801 of Title 20), system of vocational education, or other school system".&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Labor" /&gt;  As applied to K–12 schools, "the language broadly prohibits the denial of public education participation, or enjoyment of the benefits offered by public school programs because of a child's disability."&lt;ref Name="David M. Richards" /&gt;  Although the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) also applies to K-12 schools, the existence of IDEA does not mean the Rehabilitation Act is superfluous. IDEA only protects a subset of children and youth who have disabilities—those who satisfy its definition for "child with a disability".&lt;ref Name="34 CFR § 300.8"&gt;Title 34—Education § 300.8 "Child with a disability means a child . . . having mental retardation, a hearing impairment (including deafness), a speech or language impairment, a visual impairment (including blindness), a serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this part as ''emotional disturbance''), an orthopedic impairment, autism, traumatic brain injury, an other health impairment, a specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services."&lt;/ref&gt;  The definition of disability under Section 504 is broader than that of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], so some children who do not meet the IDEA definition of disability are served under Section 504.

Section 504 requires school districts to provide [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE) to children with disabilities, who may benefit from public education, within the individual district's jurisdiction. Regardless of the child's disability, the school district must identify the child's educational needs and provide any regular or special education to satisfy the child's educational needs just as well as it does for the children without disabilities. This may be accomplished by developing an education plan for the child. When done so under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, it is referred to as a 504 plan. This 504 plan covers accommodations, services, and support the child will be receiving in order to have access to education at school. A 504 plan is different and less detailed than an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Difference Between IEPs and 504 Plans|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/504-plan/the-difference-between-ieps-and-504-plans|website=Understood: for learning &amp; attention issues|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 504 supports rights for students for needs outside of the school day, such as extracurricular activities, sports, and after-school care, because Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. While the process for accommodating students varies per institution, schools generally comply with Section 504 by identifying students with disabilities and evaluating those students. If the students are eligible, they create a written accommodation plan, often called a "504 Plan." It is similar to, but often shorter than, the IDEA [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). Parents, teachers, and school staff are a part of the process. Parents have due process rights; where they disagree with the determinations of the school, they have a right to an impartial hearing.

Violations of Section 504 in the educational environment can be addressed locally with the education agency or with the [http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html?src=oc Office for Civil Rights] (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education. Violations of Section 504 can result in a loss of the federal funding. According to the Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/504faq.html#interrelationship|title=Protecting Students With Disabilities|work=ed.gov| publisher= US Dept. of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals may also file a private right of action for violations of Sec. 504. Thus, Section 504 is enforced by OCR. IDEA is carried out by another unit of the Department, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP).

=== Extracurricular activity ===
Section 504 covers extracurricular and after school programs such as sports, music lessons, and [[day care|afterschool care]]. [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr104_main_02.tpl 34 C.F.R. § 104].37.

==Rights under Section 504==
Although not in the text of the statute, courts have held that individuals have a private right of action under Section 504.{{citation needed|date= September 2016}} While [[punitive damages]] are not available, [[compensatory damages]] are available to plaintiffs.&lt;ref name=BvG&gt;{{cite web| url= http://law.onecle.com/ussc/536/536us186.html |title= ''Barnes  v. Gorman'', 536 U.S. 181 (2002)| page= 185| website= onecle.com | publisher= Onecle Inc.| accessdate= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, these rights extend to include emotional distress damages.

In addition to its responsibility for enforcing other federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in housing, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|US Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) has a statutory responsibility under Section 504 to ensure that individuals are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving HUD assistance. Section 504 charges HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] with enforcing the right of individuals to live in federally subsidized housing free from discrimination on the basis of disability. Further, Section 504 covers employment discrimination based on disability and requires HUD and HUD-assisted agencies to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an employee or qualified applicant. It covers all HUD programs except for its mortgage insurance and loan guarantee programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/programdescription/sec504 |title= Section 504| website= HUD.gov| publisher= US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development| access-date= August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any housing that receives federal assistance, such as [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] public housing, is subject to Section 504 regulations and requirements. Any person with a disability who feels himself or herself a victim of discrimination in a HUD-funded program or activity may file a complaint with HUD under Section 504. A complaint can be filed with HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp| title= Fair Housing / Equal Opportunity| website= HUD.gov| publisher= US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development| access-date= August 15, 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120402122117/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Ffair_housing_equal_opp| archivedate= April 2, 2012| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person with disabilities feels subject to discrimination in a housing situation that does not receive federal assistance, they can also file a complaint through the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] and [[Fair Housing Act#Housing discrimination|Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act]].

== History ==

The early history of federal legislation benefiting people with disabilities includes the [[Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1920 (Smith-Fess Act)]] passed after World War I, one of the first U.S. laws that provided services for all Americans with disabilities, not just veterans with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rds.colostate.edu/history-of-legislation|title=A Brief History of Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=Resources for Disabled Students|publisher=Colorado State University|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, subsequent laws and amendments included additional vocational rehabilitation measures.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Section 504 brought the language of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to the Rehabilitation of Act of 1973.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Disability Rights Movement: from Charity to Confrontation|last=Fleischer|first=Doris Zames|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|last=Shapiro|first=Joseph|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=64–70|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a law that fell within the office of Health, Education, and Welfare, this was an unlikely place for a social justice provision, yet inserting such a rights clause happened without fanfare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schweik|first=Susan|year=2011|title="Lomax's Matrix: Disability, Solidarity, and theBlack Power of 504"|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1371|journal=DSQ (Disability Studies Quarterly)|volume=31:1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working behind the scenes on what most believed was a bill related to budget, a staffer added the thirty-five words that addressed issues of discrimination related to disability. This was a departure from prevailing views that considered [[Medical model of disability|disability to be purely a medical condition]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law prohibited any entity receiving federal funding (such as government offices, schools, universities, hospitals, and post offices) from discriminating against someone because of a disability.

Concerned about costs and enforcement, the Nixon and Ford Administrations attempted to stall the regulations both by rewriting them and calling for further study regarding their impact if they did stay in their present form.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Institutions such as universities and hospitals hoped to avoid bad publicity and huge expenses by waiting out the regulation process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Activists Handbook: Winning Social Change in the 21st Century,|last=Shaw|first=Randy|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=202–208|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights groups, especially the [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD)]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disability Protests: Contentious Politics: 1970-1999|last=Barnartt|first=Sharon|last2=Scotch|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=164–166|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; understood the implications and advocated to keep them in place unchanged. Section 504 required another step before being implemented (and thus enforced), a signature from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). In 1975 a federal lawsuit was filed to force the agency to act. In July 1976, a federal district for Washington DC ruled that the regulations should be issued "with no further unreasonable delays." As the arrival of a new president drew near, HEW Secretary under departing President Gerald Ford, David Matthews, left them unsigned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During his campaign, [[Jimmy Carter]] promised to change this if he was elected president. When he took office in January 1977, he too grew concerned about costs and invited [[Joseph A. Califano Jr.|Joseph Califano]], the new HEW head, to study the legislation and its implications by establishing a task force that did not include representation from ACCD or anyone with a disability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Word leaked out that the 504 regulations that insisted on full integration of people with disabilities were being changed into something more akin to "separate but equal." ACCD members tried to reach President Carter, who had promised to support disability rights during a campaign speech in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], a significant location because it had been President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR's]] wheelchair-accessible "home away from home" while he was in the White House. Carter insisted that the matter fell to Califano.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Protests and Outcome ===
After resistance from Joseph Califano to signing the regulations, national protests were organized, which are now known as the [[504 Sit-in]]. Due to the pressure of the protests, Joseph Califano signed the regulations unchanged on April 28, 1977.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm|title=Disability History Timeline|year=2002|publisher=[[Temple University]]|work=Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living Management|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm|archivedate=2013-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/drilm/resources/timeline.html|title=The Regents of the University of California. 2008.

Some also seemed reluctant to leave the disability city, the "mini-Woodstock" they had created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faded Scars: My Queer Disability History|last=O'Toole|first=Corbett Joan|publisher=Autonomous Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites7.sfsu.edu/longmoreinstitute/patient-no-more|title=Patient No More: People with Disabilities Securing Civil Rights," Online Exhibit sponsored by Paul K.

Protesters held a large victory rally in Civic Center Plaza where occupiers sang "We Have Overcome," then toasted with champaign and gave victory speeches. Organizer Kitty Cone captured the mood and the accomplishment by saying: "We showed strength and power and courage and commitment, that we the shut-ins or the shut-outs, that we the hidden, supposedly the frail and the weak, that we could wage a struggle at the highest level of government and win!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/tags/disability%20rights|title=Kitty Cone Victory Speech|last=Cone|first=Kitty|date=|website=DREDF|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, Section 504 was controversial because it afforded people with disabilities many rights similar to those for other minority groups in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Throughout the [[Reagan administration]], efforts were made to weaken Section 504. [[Patrisha Wright|Patricia Wright]] and [[Evan Kemp, Jr.]] (of the Disability Rights Center) led a grassroots and lobbying campaign against this that generated more than 40,000 cards and letters.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; In 1984, the administration dropped its attempts to weaken Section 504; however, they did end the Social Security benefits of hundreds of thousands of disabled recipients.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;

The protest is considered "perhaps the single most impressive act of civil disobedience in the United States over the last quarter-century."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The success ensured that disability rights would be understood to be a civil right, that disabled people could claim an identity alongside those of racial, ethnic, and gender identities. It has been described as the Stonewall of the disability rights movement because it solidified the American struggle for disability rights. The successful action showed people with disabilities to be capable of grassroots action and ongoing public protest for the first time in history.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It brought together people with different disabilities to forge coalitions that would work together to draft and pass the 1990s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

The protests also led Califano to sign the regulations for the 1975 [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]], another law awaiting a signature from the head of HEW after congress had passed it. Along with provisions from 504, this law paved the way for bringing children with disabilities into the educational mainstream, giving them access to better schooling and opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The new law provoked some resistance and backlash from organizations that complained of costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 504 trainings ====
As part of the 504 victory, the federal government funded disability activists to travel across the United States to explain to people with disabilities and local officials the rights guaranteed by the law. This helped spread the disability rights movement beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.

==== Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ====
The 504 occupation created a generation of disability rights activists and advocates who would go on to draft the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990]]. The ADA can be viewed as picking up where 504 left off, handling the more difficult, complex situations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Using Section 504 as a template, the framers of the ADA sought to extend provisions that now applied to government to much of the private sector (notably private employers, stores, hotels, and restaurants). The new law also specifically stated that the ADA would not amend or weaken Section 504. Because of being drafted based on 504, the ADA also framed disability in the context of civil rights rather than as a medical need, using terms such as "discrimination," "reasonable accommodation," and "otherwise qualified."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The cross-disability coalitions forged during the 504 protests also ensured that the ADA would employ a broad definition of disability so that it could encompass a wide variety of impairment groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Like Section 504, the ADA includes people with psychiatric disabilities, alcoholics, and recovered drug addicts (though current drug users are excluded).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Activists formed by the 504 occupation such as [[Patrisha Wright|Patricia Wrigh]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t spent the next thirteen years building relationships in Washington that would help pave the way for passing the ADA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With thirteen years of Section 504 on the books, framers of the ADA could point to evidence that the earlier law had not led to the massive economic collapse that some had predicted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (115-6)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14282">'''Self-interference cancellation (SIC)''' is a [[signal processing]] technique that enables a radio transceiver to simultaneously transmit and receive on a single channel, a pair of partially-overlapping channels, or any pair of channels in the same frequency band. When used to allow simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency, sometimes referred to as “in-band full-duplex” or “simultaneous transmit and receive,” SIC effectively doubles [[spectral efficiency]]. SIC also enables devices and platforms containing two radios that use the same frequency band to operate both radios simultaneously.

Self-interference cancellation has applications in [[cellular network|mobile networks]], the unlicensed bands, [[cable television|cable TV]], [[mesh networking|mesh networks]], the military, and public safety.

In-band full-duplex has advantages over conventional duplexing schemes. A frequency division duplexing (FDD) system transmits and receives at the same time by using two (usually widely separated) channels in the same frequency band. In-band full-duplex performs the same function using half of the spectrum resources. A time division duplexing (TDD) system operates half-duplex on a single channel, creating the illusion of full-duplex communication by rapidly switching back-and-forth between transmit and receive. In-band full-duplex radios achieve twice the throughput using the same spectrum resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71d8/68ffe337e74e719184b698240ea259b656be.pdf|title=Applications of self-interference cancellation in 5G and beyond|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=52|number=2|pages=114–121|access-date=2018-04-23|year=2014|last1=Hong|first1=Steven|last2=Brand|first2=Joel|last3=Choi|first3=Jung|last4=Jain|first4=Mayank|last5=Mehlman|first5=Jeff |last6=Katti|first6=Sachin |last7=Levis|first7=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
A radio transceiver cannot cancel out its own transmit signal based solely on knowledge of what information is being sent and how the transmit signal is constructed. The signal that the receiver sees is not entirely predictable. The signal that appears at the receiver is subject to varying delays. It consists of a combination of leakage (the signal traveling directly from the transmitter to the receiver) and local reflections. In addition, transmitter components (such as mixers and power amplifiers) introduce non-linearities that generate harmonics and noise. These distortions must be sampled at the output of the transmitter. Finally, the self-interference cancellation solution must detect and compensate for real-time changes caused by temperature variations, mechanical vibrations, and the motion of things in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~skatti/pubs/sigcomm13-fullduplex.pdf|title=Full duplex radios|journal=ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review |volume=43|number=4|pages=375–386|access-date=2018-04-23| year=2013|last1= Bharadia |first1=Dinesh|last2= McMilin |first2=Emily|last3=Katti|first3=Sachin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmit signal can be cancelled out at the receiver by creating an accurate model of the signal and using it to generate a new signal that when combined with the signal arriving at the receiver leaves only the desired receive signal. The precise amount of cancellation required will vary depending on the power of the transmit signal that is the source of the self-interference and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that the link is expected to handle in half-duplex mode. A typical figure for Wi-Fi and cellular applications is 110&amp;nbsp;dB of signal cancellation, though some applications require greater cancellation.

Cancelling a local transmit signal requires a combination of analog and digital electronics. The strength of the transmit signal can be modestly reduced before it reaches the receiver by using a circulator (if a shared antenna is used) or antenna isolation techniques (such as cross polarization) if separate antennas are used. The analog canceller is most effective at handling strong signals with a short delay spread. A digital canceller is most effective at handling weak signals with delays greater than 1,000 nanoseconds. The analog canceller should contribute at least 60&amp;nbsp;dB of cancellation. The digital canceller must process both linear and non-linear signal components, producing about 50&amp;nbsp;dB of cancellation. Both the analog and digital cancellers consist of a number of “taps” composed of attenuators, phase shifters, and delay elements. The cost, size, and complexity of the SIC solution is primarily determined by the analog stage. Also essential are the tuning algorithms that enable the canceller to adapt to rapid changes. Cancellation algorithms typically need to adapt at the rate of once every few hundred microseconds to keep up with changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Jung Il|last=Choi|first2=Mayank|last2=Jain|first3=Kannan|last3=Srinivasan|first4=Philip|last4= Levis|first5=Sachin|last5=Katti|title=Achieving single channel, full duplex wireless communication|conference=MobiCom, 2010.

SIC can also be employed to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference. This allows a device containing two radios (such as a Wi-Fi access Point with two 5&amp;nbsp;GHz radios) to use any pair of channels regardless of separation. Adjacent channel interference consists of two main components. The signal on the transmit frequency, known as the blocker, may be so strong that it desensitizes a receiver listening on an adjacent channel. A strong, local transmitter also produces noise that spills over onto the adjacent channel. SIC may be used to reduce both the blocker and the noise that might otherwise prevent use of an adjacent channel.

==Applications==
===In-band full duplex=== 
Transmitting and receiving on the exact same frequency at the exact same time has multiple purposes. In-band full duplex can potentially double spectral efficiency. It permits true full duplex operation where only a single frequency is available. And it enables “listen while talking” operation (see cognitive radio, below).

===Integrated access and backhaul=== 
Though most small cells are expected to be fed using fiber optic cable, running fiber isn’t always practical. Reuse of the frequencies used by a small cell to communicate with users (“access”) for communication between the small cell and the network (“backhaul”) will be part of the 3GPP’s 5G standards. When implemented using SIC, the local backhaul radio’s transmit signal is cancelled out at the small cell’s receiver, and the small cell’s transmit signal is cancelled out at the local backhaul radio’s receiver. No changes are required to the users’ devices or the remote backhaul radio. The use of SIC in this applications has been successfully field-tested by [[Telecom Italia|Telecom Italia Mobile]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fiercewireless.com/europe/italy-s-tim-kumu-test-full-duplex-relay-technology-to-double-lte-capacity|title=Italy's TIM, Kumu test full duplex relay technology to double LTE capacity|author= Anne Morris|date=25 January 2016|website=fiercewireless.com|publisher=Fierce Wireless |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/deutsche-telekom-completes-5g-full-duplex-field-trial-kumu-networks|title=Deutsche Telekom completes 5G full duplex field trial with Kumu Networks|author=Monica Alleven|date=28 September 2015|website=fiercewireless.com|publisher=Fierce Wireless |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite repeaters===
SIC enables satellite repeaters to extend coverage to indoor, urban canyon, and other locations by reusing the same frequencies. This type of repeater is essentially two radios connected back-to-back. One radio faces the satellite, while the other radio faces the area not in direct coverage. The two radios relay the signals (rather than store-and-forward data bits) and must be isolated from each other to prevent feedback. The satellite-facing radio listens to the satellite and must be isolated from the transmitter repeating the signal. Likewise, the indoor-facing radio listens for indoor users and must be isolated from the transmitter repeating their signals to the satellite. SIC may be used to cancel out each radio’s transmit signal at the other radio’s receiver.

===Full-duplex DOCSIS 3.1===
Cable networks have traditionally allocated most of their capacity to downstream transmissions. The recent growth in user-generated content calls for more upstream capacity. Cable Labs developed the Full Duplex DOCSIS 3.1 standard to enable symmetrical service at speeds up to 10 Gbps in each direction. In DOCSIS 3.1, different frequencies are allocated for upstream and downstream transmissions, separated by a guard band.  Full Duplex DOCSIS establishes a new band allowing a mix of upstream and downstream channels on adjacent channels. The headend must support simultaneous transmission and reception across the full duplex band, which requires SIC technology. The cable modems are not required to transmit and receive on the same channels simultaneously, but they are required to use different combinations of upstream and downstream channels as instructed by the headend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cablelabs.com/full-duplex-docsis-3-1-technology-raising-the-ante-with-symmetric-gigabit-service|title=Full Duplex DOCSIS® 3.1 Technology: Raising the Ante with Symmetric Gigabit Service|author=Belal Hamzeh, VP, Research &amp; Development|date=16 February 2016 |website=cablelabs.com|publisher= |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless mesh networks===
Mesh networks are used to extend coverage (to cover entire homes) and for ad-hoc networking (emergency communication). Wireless mesh networks use a mesh topology to provide the desired coverage. The data travels from one node to another until it reaches its destination. In mesh networks using a single frequency, the data is typically store-and-forwarded, with each hop adding a delay. SIC can enable wireless mesh nodes to reuse frequencies so that the data is retransmitted (relayed) as it is received. In mesh networks using multiple frequencies, such as whole-home Wi-Fi networks using “tri-band” routers, SIC can enable greater flexibility in channel selection. Tri-band routers have one 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz and one 5&amp;nbsp;GHz radio to communicate with client devices, and a second 5&amp;nbsp;GHz radio that is used exclusively for internode communication. Most tri-band routers use the same pair of 80&amp;nbsp;MHz channels (at opposite ends of the 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band) to minimize interference. SIC can allow tri-band routers to use any of the six 80-MHz channels in the 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band for coordination both within networks and between neighboring networks.

===Military communication===
The military frequently requires multiple, high power radios on the same air, land, or sea platform for tactical communication. These radios must be reliable even in the face of interference and enemy jamming. SIC enables multiple radios to operate on the same platform at the same time. SIC also has potential applications in military and vehicular radar, allowing radar systems to transmit and receive continuously rather than constantly switching between transmit and receive, yielding higher resolution.

===Spectrum sharing===
National regulatory agencies, such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the U.S., often address the need for more spectrum resources by permitting sharing of underutilized spectrum. For instance, billions of [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] devices compete for access to the [[ISM bands]]. Smartphones, Wi-Fi routers, and smart home hubs frequently support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless technologies in the same device. SIC technology enables these devices to operate two radios in the same band at the same time. Spectrum sharing is a topic of great interest to the mobile phone industry as it begins to deploy 5G systems.

===Cognitive radio===
Radios that dynamically select idle channels to make more efficient use of finite spectrum resources are the subject of considerable research. Traditional spectrum sharing schemes rely on Listen-before-talk protocols. However, when two or more radios choose to transmit on the same channel at the same time there is a collision. Collisions take time to detect and resolve. SIC enables listen-while-talking, ensuring immediate detection and faster resolution of collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title= Full duplex wireless communications for cognitive radio networks |eprint=1105.0034 |year=2013 |last1= Cheng |first1=W. |last2= Zhang |first2=X. |last3=Zhang |first3=H. |class=cs.IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Staten Island boat graveyard''' is a [[Ship graveyard|marine scrapyard]] located in the [[Arthur Kill]] in [[Rossville, Staten Island|Rossville]], near the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on the northern shore of [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]]. The place has been recognized as an official dumping ground for old wrecked [[tugboats]], [[barges]] and decommissioned [[Ferry|ferries]]. It is known by many other names including the Witte Marine Scrap Yard, the Arthur Kill Boat Yard, and the "Tugboat Graveyard." Its official name as of 2014 is the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility.&lt;ref name = "huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/staten-island-boat-graveyard_n_5544746.html?section=india|title=The Bizarre Attraction That Is New York City's Boat Graveyard|last=Mathias|first=Christopher|date=4 July 2014|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The scrapyard was founded in the 1930s by John J. Witte and managed by him until his death in 1980. It was then taken over by his son-in-law, Joe Coyne, who described it as similar to an automobile [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]], with the boats serving as a source of parts to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/nyregion/a-lesson-in-history-of-old-ships.html|title=A Lesson In History Of Old Ships|last=Meyers|first=Keith|date=December 31, 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now managed by John Witte's son Arnold. It contains about 100 boats and ships, down from an earlier high of 400.&lt;ref name = "Witte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/99670-the-witte-boneyard-different-kind-graveyard/|title=The Witte Boneyard: A Different Kind of Graveyard|publisher=[[WNYC]]|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
The abandoned and decomposing vessels, mostly cargo ships and tugboats, come from "all decades of the 20th century".&lt;ref name = "forgotten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/01/ship-graveyard-rossville-staten-island/|title=Sea of Dead Ships|date=January 27, 2010|work=Forgotten New York|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sit in the mud and shallow water until they are dismantled or salvaged. Some of them are historic, so that the place has been called an "accidental marine museum".&lt;ref name = "huff"/&gt; Vessels of historic interest include the submarine chaser {{USS|PC-1264||6}}, the first [[World War II]] US Navy ship to have a predominantly African-American crew; and the [[New York City Fire Department]] [[fireboat]] ''[[Abram S. Hewitt (fireboat)|Abram S.

The site is hard to reach and posted with "No trespassing" signs.&lt;ref name = "wired" /&gt; Nevertheless, visitors do come. Marine historians explore the area via boats or kayaks. The decaying ships are a popular subject for photographers and artists.&lt;ref name = "Witte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oboylephoto.com/boatyard/by8.htm|title=The Boatyard - Shaun O'Boyle|work=oboylephoto.com|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place, because of its eerie environment, has become a tourist attraction,&lt;ref name = "huff" /&gt; despite its remote location and difficult accessibility via "a makeshift path of street signs and wood planks into muddy marshland and to the edge of the water where the boats are visible."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140321/st-george/history-of-staten-islands-boat-graveyard-explored-documentary|title=History of Staten Island's Boat Graveyard Explored in Documentary|work=DNAinfo New York|last=Rizzi|first=Nicholas|date=21 March 2014|accessdate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204030300/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140321/st-george/history-of-staten-islands-boat-graveyard-explored-documentary|archivedate=4 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28270">'''Text and conversation''' is a [[theory]] in the field of [[organizational communication]] illustrating how [[communication]] makes up an [[organization]]. In the theory's simplest explanation, an organization is created and defined by communication. Communication "is" the organization and the organization exists because communication takes place.  The theory is built on the notion, an organization is not seen as a physical unit holding communication.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005"&gt;Miller, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Text and conversation theory puts communication processes at the heart of organizational communication and postulates, an organization doesn't contain communication as a "causal influence",&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt; but is formed by the communication within. This theory is not intended for direct application, but rather to explain how communication exists. The theory provides a [[conceptual framework|framework]] for better understanding organizational communication.

Since the foundation of organizations are in communication,&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999"&gt;Taylor, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization cannot exist without communication, and the organization is defined as the result of communications happening within its context. Communications begin with individuals within the organization discussing [[beliefs]], [[goal]]s, [[structure]]s, [[plans]] and relationships. These communicators achieve this through constant development, delivery, and translation of "text and conversation". The theory proposes mechanisms of communications are "[[literary work|text]] and "[[conversation]]".

== Definitions ==
The foundation of this theory is the concepts of text and conversation. Text is defined as the content of [[interaction]], or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or electronic mode of communication. Conversation is defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. Conversation is the exchange or interaction itself.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt;

The process of the text and conversation exchange is [[reciprocal determinism|reciprocal]]: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using [[punctuation]], [[bracketing]] or [[framing (social sciences)|framing]]. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt; Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the [[translation]] of conversation into text.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
*"text" = content and meaning
*"conversation" = [[discourse]] and exchange

== Theorist ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:James renwick taylor.jpg|thumb|James R. Taylor]] --&gt;

[[James R. Taylor]], introduced text and conversation theory in 1996 with [[François Cooren]], Giroux and Robichaud and then further explored the theory in 1999.  Taylor drew on the work of sociologist and educator [[John Dewey| John Dewey’s]] pragmatic view society exists not "by" but "in" communication.  Taylor followed the same principle, putting communication as the essence of an organization.
He was born in 1928 and is [[Professor Emeritus]] at the Department of Communication of the [[Université de Montréal]], which he founded in the early 1970s. Drawing from research in fields of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational psychology]] ([[Karl E. Weick]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), Deirdre Boden), [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]) and collective minding ([[Edwin Hutchins]]), Taylor formed the original text and conversation theory. This line of thought has come to be known as "The Montreal School" of organizational communication, sometimes referred to as TMS, and has been acknowledged as an original theory by authors such as [[Haridimos Tsoukas]], Linda Putman, and Karl E. Weick.
*Taylor said,"...organization emerges in communication, which thus furnishes not only the site of its appearance to its members, but also the surface on which members read the meaning of the organization to them." Taylor argues communication is the "site and emergence of organization."&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt;

== Foundational theories ==

=== Structuration theory ===
"[[Structuration theory]]" identifies how text and conversation theory evolved from this communication construct.  Proposed by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1984) in ‘’The Constitution on Society,’’ structuration theory, originated in the discipline of sociology.  Giddens’ theory has been adapted to the field of communication, particularly organizational communication; specifically, how and why [[structural change]]s are possible and the duality of formal and informal communication.
This theory is based on concepts of [[structure and agency]].  structure is defined as rules and resources of an organization; agency is the free will to choose to do otherwise than prescribed through structure.
*"structure":  is rules and resources, the reason we do things because of the structure of how we were raised (culture, sociological and [[physiological]]).  Giddens (1984) explains these rules as recipes or procedures for accomplishing tasks within an organization.  Resources have two subsets: allocative and authoritative, which can be leveraged to accomplish desired outcomes.  Allocative are quantitative resources, while authoritative are qualitative.
*"[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]": is the free will to choose to do otherwise. Agency is the reason people do things, because they have a choice&lt;ref&gt;Gidden, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the process individuals internalize actions and make choices, rather than making decisions because the structure says they should.  Structure is based on the formal organization and accepted policy. Agency is informal communication and individually based.
*"Dualism": mutually exclusive answer (i.e., either/or)
*"Duality": mutually constitutive answer (i.e., both/and)
*"[[Structuration]]": society itself is located in a [[duality of structure]] in which the enactments of agency become structures that, across time, produce possibilities for agency enactment.
*Another way explain it is structure is the context.
Structuration theory identifies [[structure and agency]] as coexisting. Formal rules and resources impact informal communication and discourse. This duality and coexistence ensures a cyclical nature between structure and agency, which has a cause and effect:  new structure and agency is created from the causal relationships of previous structure and agency decisions. The concept to understanding structuration is to understand to duality of structure &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman and Cowan, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of Giddens’ theory and conversation and text theory is a mutual-existing and causal relationship of communication. The main difference, between the two, is structuration theory explains how communication impacts the organization, text and conversation, by means of structure and agency. Giddens' construct of structuration explains how mutually causal relationships constitute the essence of an organization. This concept illustrates how communication within an organization depends on the translation of meaning.

=== Conversation theory ===
"[[Conversation theory]]", proposed by [[Gordon Pask]] in the 1970s, identifies a framework to explain how [[scientific theory]] and interactions formulate the "construction of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversation Theory is based on the idea [[social system]]s are symbolic and language-oriented.  Additionally, these systems are based on responses and interpretations, and the meaning interpreted by individuals via communication&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory is based on interaction between two or more individuals, with unlike perspectives&lt;ref&gt;Scott, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of having unlike perspectives is that it enables a distinctive standpoint:  it permits the ability to study how people identify differences and understand meaning.  Additionally, these differences create shared and consensual pockets of interactions and communications as discussed in [[Structure-Organization-Process]].&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another idea of conversation theory is learning happens by exchanges about issues, which assists in making [[knowledge]] explicit.  In order for this to happen, Pask organized three levels of conversation, according to:&lt;ref name="cortland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Pask.htm |title=Conversation Theory&amp;nbsp;— Gordon Pask |publisher=Web.cortland.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Natural language]]": general discussion
*"[[Object language]]s": for discussing the subject matter
*"[[Metalanguages]]": for talking about learning/language
Additionally, to facilitate learning, Pask proposed two types of learning strategies.&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt;
*"Serialists": progress through a structure in a sequential fashion
*"[[Holist]]s": look for higher order relations
Ultimately, Pask found versatile learners neither favor one approach over the other. Rather, they understand how both approaches are integrated into the structure of learning. The similarities of conversation theory and text and conversation theory are they both focus on the foundational aspects of meaning. Specifically, how and why meaning is established and interpreted amongst individuals. However, the difference between the two theories is conversation theory specifically focuses on the dynamics of two people. Text and conversation theory is typically applied to at least two people. Conversation theory emphasizes the construct of knowledge of meaning and the [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationship that occurs as a result of [[Autodidacticism|self-learning]] from communication, based on meaning.

== Factors ==

=== Meaning ===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
"Meaning management" is the control of "context" and "message" to accomplish a desired communication effect. According to Fairhurst, leaders are change agents&lt;ref name=fair2011&gt;{{harvnb|Fairhurst|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders define the value of the organization and shape communication by implementing unique organizational communication approaches. Within an organization, leaders and managers establish the framework for communication, which helps to manage meaning. "Leaders" provide information to followers, such as the organizations’ mission, vision, values, as well as its [[collective identity]] &lt;ref&gt;Fairhurst, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to leaders, "managers" are responsible for day to day [[problem solving]]. Their core framing tasks are solving problems and stimulating others to find solutions.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Individuals, regardless of positional authority, can manage meaning. Meaning management is to communicate with a specific goal by controlling the context and message&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt; Individuals utilizing meaning management are communicating and shaping the meaning by using the power of framing.

=== Culture ===
"[[Culture]]" is a unique set of behaviors, including language, belief and customs learnt from being raised in [[social group]]s or by joining a particular group throughout time. Culture defines context and is the social totality that defines behavior, knowledge, beliefs and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]]. It is a set of shared values characterizing a specific organization. Fairhurst identifies culture as defining events, people, objects, and concepts.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt; Communication and culture are intertwined. Shared language of a group links together individuals and joins common cultures. Culture influences [[mental model]]s. "Mental models" are the images in your mind about other people, yourself, substance and events.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Additionally, culture defines [[social interaction]]s and how individuals and groups interpret and apply context. Organizations with good communication foundation are able to interpret and differentiate individuals’ cultural discourses, as well as creatively combine and constrain these discourses.&lt;ref name="Fairhurst, 2007"&gt;Fairhurst, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ir defines the ideological basis for people and lays the foundation for how they frame and can be observed and described, but not controlled. It is defined by the group or individual accepting the specific patterns of behavior, knowledge, or beliefs  Individuals can shape culture and make changes over time, as long as they are clear about specific attitudes and behaviors that are desired &lt;ref name="Fairhurst, 2007"/&gt;  As [[Weick]] and Sutcliffe (2007) discussed, culture can be changed through symbols, values, and content&amp;nbsp;— organizations shape culture.  An [[organizational culture]] emerges from a set of expectations that matter to people, from things like [inclusion, exclusion, praise, positive feelings, [[social support]], isolation, care, indifference, excitement and anger &lt;ref&gt;Weick and Suitcliffe, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals are shaped by an organization's culture.  However, an organization has its own culture. According to Martin (1985), within that organizational culture, three forms of culture can result: integration, differentiation and fragmentation.
*"[[Social integration|Integration]]" (bring people together)
*"[[Differentiation (sociology)|Differentiation]]" (act or process by which people undergo change toward more specialized function)
*"[[Fragmentation (sociology)|Fragmentation]]" (process of state of breaking or being broken into smaller parts)
With Integration, all organizational members consistently share values and assumptions about work. As a result the members of the organization share uniquely organizational experiences and thus, a unique culture&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985"&gt;Martin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
If differentiation occurs, cultures are not unitary. Sub-groups consistently share values and assumptions about work.  Members tend to operate in different areas, different projects and at different levels of the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985" /&gt;
Cultures are often ambiguous if fragmentation happens. Individuals are interconnected with some members and disconnected with others. This creates inconsistently shared values and assumptions about the organization&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985" /&gt; As a result friendship/romantic as well as enemy/competitor type relationships are cut across an organization’s sub-groups.

=== Structure ===
Individuals who understand the structure and inner working of their organizations can leverage knowledge toward achieving communication goals. Likewise, organizations can also leverage their hierarchical structures to achieve targeted outcomes.
Two types of structures exist within an organization.
*"[[Hierarchical]]" (formal hierarchical structure, typical flow/pyramid chart)
*"Network" (informal structure, based on relationships, go to people, subject-matter experts)
Goldsmith and Katzenback (2008) explained organizations must understand the informal organization. For example, of being a part of an informal or formal structure, it is important for managers to learn to recognize signs of trouble in order to shape context as they attempt to coordinate meaning and solve day-to-day problems. Specific implications for [[organizational learning]] include enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, [[division of labor]] and collective goal setting &lt;ref name="BEA07"&gt;Bryan et al, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
While a formal organization is visually represented by a typical hierarchical structure, it visually shows how formal responsibilities are spread, as well as job dispersal and the flow of information&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith and Katzenback, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the informal organization embodies how people network to accomplish the job, via social relationships and connections or [[subject-matter expert]]s that are not represented on the organizational chart&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith and Katzenbach, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  By leveraging this informal organization, people within the organization are able to use their [[social network]] to access and shape the [[decision-making process]]es quicker, as well as establish cross-structural collaboration amongst themselves.
Additionally, by understanding and using both structures, leaders and managers are able to learn more about their people.  Interpreting all forms of communication, verbal and visual, whether you are a supervisor or a subordinate is invaluable.  The hierarchical and network structures can allow an organization to recognize signs of trouble from people, accomplish core framing tasks, and to be able to communicate with mindfulness and meaning.  By unlocking the value of an organization's structure, leaders and managers can use this knowledge to boost performance or achieve specific goals.&lt;ref name="BEA07"/&gt; Signs of trouble can be emotional, hidden, physical, or in plain sight.

=== Knowledge ===
Knowing individuals’ personalities, conflict tendencies, as well as their unique circumstances help an organization to understand its [[mental model]]s and cultural discourse.  Additionally, by noticing abnormalities and not being blind to details, an organization should be able to recognize signs of trouble within day-to-day operations and management, whether it is fraud, lack of maintenance standards, [[sexual harassment]], or even a poor framework for communication.
Understanding and the ability to recognize signs of trouble empower managers to employ the rules of reality construction:  control the context, define the situation, apply ethics, interpret uncertainty, and design the response, which leads to communicating by a structured way of thinking.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Ultimately, by understanding how an organization works, you enhance communication collectively.&lt;ref name="BEA07" /&gt; Additionally, by knowing how employees and relationships are shaped and the context that defines how each person interacts with one another, you can shape contagious emotions.
Basic building blocks of Taylor’s theories is the relationship of text and conversation, and how that relationship requires a "two-step translational process"&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
*translation One:  From text to conversation
*translation Two: From conversation to text
Following this translational process, text and conversation is transferred to organizational communication. If context, or text, defines the organization then ongoing introductions and meaning are crucial to define what is meant by the term organization.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
To examine this further, Taylor defined "six degrees of separation" to understand organizational communication:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor et al, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*First Degree of Separation: Intent of speaker is translated into action and embedded in conversation.
*Second Degree of Separation: Events of the conversation are translated into a narrative representation, making it possible to understand the meaning of the exchange.
*Third Degree of Separation: The text is transcribed (objectified) on some permanent or semi-permanent medium (e.g., the minutes of a meeting are taken down in writing).
*Fourth Degree of Separation: A specialized language is developed to encourage and channel subsequent texts and conversations(e.g., lawyers develop specific ways of talking in court, with each other, and in documents).
*Fifth Degree of Separation: The texts and conversations are transformed into material and physical frames (e.g., laboratories, conference rooms, organizational charts, procedural manuals).
*Sixth Degree of Separation: The standardized form is disseminated and diffused to a broader public (e.g., media reports and representations of organizational forms and practices).

== Impact ==
This theory uses interactions of text and conversation to construct networks of relationships. By doing so, the theory enables a deep understanding of personal communication within an organization. Additionally, it explains how that communication ends up actually defining the organization, rather than the individuals within the organization. Taylor’s theory places more importance on personal communication, rather than individuals. The practical application, as a result, is communication behaviors can constitute how and what we think of an organization. Additionally, by manipulating communication processes, not only could structure be altered, but the entire organization could be changed as well&lt;ref name="Heath et al, 2006"&gt;Heath et al, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; whether change is beneficial or negative, is based on desired meaning, or context and message, people within the organization want to exchange and translate.

Taylor stresses the importance and impact of dialogue, specifically relating to how people interact with one another and interpret context. Taylor explains in Heath et al. (2006) that virtuous reasoning embodies entire discussions. Additionally, he points out dialogue should not prevent issues that arise from debate&lt;ref name="Heath et al, 2006"/&gt; Since 1993, Taylor’s theory has been the focus of more than six organizational communication books. Additionally, Taylor’s ideas are referred to as "The Montreal School" of organizational communication&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt; Within the field of communication, TMS has been recognized for its contributions to organizational communication as well as related disciplines. Books focusing on text and conversation theory have sold internationally&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt; One to the largest and simplest contributions this theory provided the communication academic field was the ability to describe and characterize and organization. From this, people could better understand and fully construct and organization’s identity.

== Weakness ==
According to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), [[organizational learning]] is the study of how collectives adapt to, or fail to adapt to, their environments.  It utilizes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.
*"[[Tacit Knowledge]]": personal, contextual, subjective, implicit, and unarticulated
*"[[Explicit Knowledge]]": codified, systematic, formal, explicit, and articulated
Ultimately, organizational learning achieves enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, and achievement of collective goals by externalization and internalization.
*"[[Externalization]]": getting key workers to make their tacit knowledge the organization’s explicit knowledge that can be shared
*"[[Internalization]]": getting the organization’s explicit knowledge to become workers’ tacit knowledge
Text and conversation theory places significant challenges and burdens on the organization to articulate knowledge.  Whether knowledge is passed directly by individuals, up and down or horizontally on the formal or informal organizational structure, there is no guarantee text has proper context to be effective as conversation.  Additionally, conversation codes are influenced by how the organization ensures knowledge carriers pass information and communicate with purpose, message, and meaning.
How information is passed can be unclear, and consistently has to adapt to new challenges.  Some of these challenges, or factors, include how individuals and an organization adapt to meaning, culture, structure, and knowledge, in order to communicate.
Ultimately, within the organization itself, people are impacted by bias’ on group and individual levels.

"Problems with Group Learning"
*Responsibility bias:  belief of group members’ that someone else in the group will do the work
*[[Social desirability bias]]:  group members are reluctant to provide critical assessments for fear of losing face or relational status
*Hierarchical mum effect:  subordinates’ reluctance to provide negative feedback for fear of harming identifies of superiors
*[[Groupthink]]:  failure to consider decision alternatives
*Identification/[[ego defense]]:  highly identified group members begin to associate their identify with their group membership and will in turn refuse to see the group as wrong, and themselves by extension
"Problems with Individual Learning"
*[[Confirmation bias]]:  individuals seeks to confirm their own ideas, guesses and beliefs rather than seek dis-confirming information
*[[Hindsight bias]]:  individuals tend to forget when their predictions are wrong
*[[Fundamental attribution error]]:  individuals tend to attribute others shortcomings to their character, while attributing their own shortcomings to external forces

The '''Thawri''' (Arabic:الثوري) [[Madhhab]] was a short lived school of [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]]. Its founder was [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Al-Thawri]], a great 8th Century [[alim|scholar]], jurist and hadith compiler.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Steven C. Judd, “Competitive hagiography in biographies of al-Awzaʿi and Sufyan al-Thawri”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 122:1 (Jan–March, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Ath-Thawri's]] move to Basra later in his life, his jurisprudential thought ([[Usul al-fiqh|usul]]) became more closely aligned to that of the [[Umayyads]] and of [[al-Awza'i|Al-Azwa'i]].&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt;

He spent the last year of his life hiding after a dispute between him and the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad Ibn Mansur Al-Mahdi]]. After his death, the Thawri [[Madhhab]] was taken up by his students, including notably Yahya al-Qattan.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; However, his school did not survive, but his jurisprudential thought and especially hadith transmission are highly regarded in Islam, and have influenced all the major [[madh'hab|schools]].

As they respond to contemporaneous [[News|events]] and [[politics]], [[the arts]] take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit. For instance [[Pushkin]], who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he "instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"/&gt;

==History of art and social and political change==
According to Groys, "[[Art]] has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics."&lt;ref name=Groys&gt;

Silver's "specific goal [is] … to present works of art with a greater depth of treatment and a more historical and contextual view of their audiences and cultures than most survey volumes", and Graham focuses particularly on the way that Silver "chose and organized his topics [in this textbook] to investigate relations between art and power."&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the [[List of conflicts in the Middle East#Modern conflicts|Modern conflicts]] in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that "art is useless as a tool for political change."&lt;ref name=Slackman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

== The role of poetry ==

{{Quote|text=Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.|sign=[[Percy B. Shelley|Percy Bysshe Shelley]]|source=''[[A Defence of Poetry]]''}}

The Italian poet [[Ungaretti]], when interviewed on transgression by director [[Pasolini]] for the 1964 ''[[Love Meetings]]'' documentary, said that the foundation of [[poetry]] is to transgress all laws: "I am a poet and as such I begin transgressing all the laws by doing poetry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pasolini]] (1964) ''[[Love Meetings]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EerTTC-YO8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Situationist International===
The [[Situationist International]] (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in [[Marxism]], [[Lettrism]] and the early 20th-century European artistic and political [[avant-garde]]s formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the [[Second Situationist International]], the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an [[anti-capitalist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics, according to Italian art historian [[Francesco Poli]].&lt;ref name=Poli&gt;{{cite book|last=Poli|first=Francesco|others=Trans. F. Scarpelli and A. Andreacchio|title=I situazionisti e la loro storia|editor=Guy Debord and Gianfranco Sanguinetti|publisher=Manifestolibri|location=Rome|year=2006|pages=63|isbn=978-88-7285-438-9 |quote=caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in [[revolutionary]] terms .&lt;ref name=Bandini&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandini|first=Mirella|title=L'estetico, il politico.

Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural [[dichotomies]] as the "separation of art from politics". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of [[The Society of the Spectacle|the society of the spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entropa'' attracted controversy both for its [[stereotype]]d depictions of the various [[European Union|EU]] member states and for having been a creation of Černý and two friends rather than, as Černý purported, a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states.&lt;ref name="CTK"/&gt;  Some [[European Union|EU]] members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country, with [[Bulgaria]], for instance, deciding to summon the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Ambassador to [[Sofia]] in order to discuss the illustration of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] country as a collection of [[squat toilet]]s (ČTK).  This "Europe-wide [[hoax]] … reveals deeper truths" not only about the countries but "about art itself" (Gavrilova).

===Russian aesthetics===
According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in her book ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich'', in "the traditional Russian perception of the arts", an "interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion" (ix; [[cf.]] Blois).

===Classical music===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] did not use the original title "Ode to Freedom" of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[lyric poem|lyric]], known in English as "[[Ode to Joy]]" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824), which "[[Napoleon]]ic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'."&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], on 9 November 1989, that Christmas Day, when [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth at the site of the former [[East Germany|East German]]&amp;ndash;[[West Germany|West German]] border in Berlin, a concert [[Public Broadcasting Service|telecast nationally]] in the United States, he substituted ''Freedom'' for ''Joy'' to reflect his own "personal message".&lt;ref&gt;

===Folk and protest music===

In February 1952, the [[United States Customs Service]] seized the passport of [[Paul Robeson]], preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]], in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada; but, after "The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone", the union organized "a concert on the US-Canada border".&lt;ref name="Robeson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the account of the "Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration": "Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes. He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you—all of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' … [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of [[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]], written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others."&lt;ref name="Robeson"/&gt;

In the 1960s the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and others protested further [[racism]], war, and the [[military-industrial complex]], continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]].&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2008 a "Promoters Ordinance" proposed by the [[Chicago City Council]] aroused opposition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], for being regarded as overly restrictive and stifling [[Freedom of speech|free expression]].&lt;ref&gt;

Following the implementation of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] cited "the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism" as reasons for expecting promoters of [[live music]] events to complete the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Form 696]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the perceived "demand" for the information solicited on such "[[risk assessment]]" forms motivated [[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and The Makers]], to post an [[Internet petition|electronic petition]] in the "E-Petitions" section of the official website of [[Gordon Brown]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]], at  Number10.gov.uk, in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is "[[Racism|racial discrimination]]" occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints,&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;

UK Music chief [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... speaking to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee|Department of Culture Media and Sport]]'s hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of [[terrorism]]'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Met]]'s clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such [[Risk Assessment]]s would be processed this year.

'''Topophysis''' occurs when [[Scion (grafting)|scions]] (young shoots and twigs), buddings, or root cuttings continue to grow in the same way after [[grafting]] as they had while growing on the [[ortet]].&lt;ref name=olese1978&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olese|first1=P. O.|title=On cyclophysis and topophysis.|journal=Silvae Genetica|date=1978|volume=27|issue=5|pages=173–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bredmose1996&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bredmose|first1=N.|last2=Hansen|first2=J.|title=Topophysis affects the potential of axillary bud growth, fresh biomass accumulation and specific fresh weight in single-stem roses (Rosa hybrida L.).|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1996|volume=78|issue=2|pages=215–222|doi=10.1006/anbo.1996.0115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the scion or propagule grows in the same branchlike way, it is called [[Glossary_of_plant_morphology#Stems|plagiotropic]] growth.&lt;ref name=bredmose1996/&gt; [[Glossary_of_plant_morphology#Stems|Orthotropic]] growth is when the scion begins to grow in the same upward manner as the ortet.&lt;ref name=bredmose1996/&gt; The duration of plagiotropic growth habit depends on the tree species and developmental stage (whether bud or scion) when cut, before the [[ramet]] changes to orthotropic growth and matures.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; This maturation is dependent on the position of the scion growth in relation to the axillary buds.&lt;ref name=fd2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Vegetative Propagation, Definitions and Terminology|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad224e/ad224e02.htm|website=FAO Corporate Document Repository|publisher=Forestry Department|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; The rate of maturation is decreased in lateral shoots for every order they are removed from the apical meristem and the total distance grown from the apical meristem.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt;

[[Hans Molisch]] first introduced the term topohysis in 1915 in response to [[Hermann Vöchting|Hermann Vöchting’s]] 1904 ''[[Araucaria excelsa]]'' cutting propagation experiment.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; Vöchting recorded that cuttings from the terminal shoots immediately developed into normal plants with orthotropic growth. Cuttings from the first order lateral branches first developed into plants resembling side branches (plagiotropic  growth) before growing orthotropically. Cuttings from the second order lateral branches grew into horizontal shoots with no side branches for the longest time before growing orthotropically.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; He concluded that the onset of axillary bud growth is mainly affected by the position relative to the ortets axillary bud.

William J. Robbins addressed the nature of topophysis in a 1964 paper in which he considered it to be a matter of somatic inheritance. See "Topophysis, a problem in somatic inheritance". Proc. Am. Philos. Soc. 108: 395-403.

{{about|variegation in botany|histology|Variegation (histology)}}
[[Image:Ficus carica Panascè.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Variegation of fruits and wood in ''[[Ficus carica]] Panascè'', a bicolor (yellow-green) common fig cultivar. This Italian cultivar is a ''[[Chimera (plant)|chimera]]'']]
'''Variegation''' is the appearance of differently coloured zones in the leaves, and sometimes the [[Plant stem|stems]], of plants. Variegated leaves occur rarely in nature. Species with variegated individuals are sometimes found in the [[understory]] of [[tropical rainforest]]s, and this habitat is the source of a number of variegated house plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Variegated Leaves|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/variegation.html|website=UCLA College|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615002817/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/variegation.html|archive-date=2016-06-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used to refer to colour zonation in [[flower]]s, [[mineral]]s, and the skin, fur, feathers or scales of animals.

== Causes ==
=== Chimeral ===
Because the variegation is due to the presence of two kinds of plant tissue, propagating the plant must be by a vegetative method of propagation that preserves both types of tissue in relation to each other. Typically, stem [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]], bud and stem [[grafting]], and other propagation methods that results in growth from leaf axil buds will preserve variegation. Cuttings with complete variegation may be difficult if not impossible to propagate. Root cuttings will not usually preserve variegation, since the new stem tissue is derived from a particular tissue type within the root.

[[Image:VariegatedHollyBush.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Variegation in [[holly]] leaves]]
[[Image:PileaCadierei.jpg|thumb|left|Reflective variegation in ''[[Pilea cadierei]]''.]]
Some variegation is due to visual effects caused by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light from the leaf surface. This can happen when an air layer is located just under the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] resulting in a white or silvery reflection. It is sometimes called blister variegation.

''[[Pilea]]'' (aluminum plant) is an example of a house plant that shows this effect. Leaves of most ''[[Cyclamen]]'' species show such patterned variegation, varying between plants, but consistent within each plant.

Another type of reflective variegation is caused by hairs on parts of the leaf, which may be coloured differently from the leaf. This is found in various ''[[Begonia]]'' species and garden hybrids.

Sometimes venal variegation occurs – the veins of the leaf are picked out in white or yellow. This is due to lack of green tissue above the veins. It can be seen in some aroids.

The [[Silybum marianum|blessed milk thistle]], ''Silybum marianum'', is a plant in which another type of venal variegation occurs, but in this case it is due to a blister variegation occurring along the veins.

=== Pigmentary ===

A common cause of variegation is the masking of green [[pigment]] by other pigments, such as [[anthocyanin]]s. This often extends to the whole leaf, causing it to be reddish or purplish. On some plants however, consistent zonal markings occur; such as on some [[clover]]s, [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], certain ''[[Pelargonium]]'' and ''[[Oxalis]]'' species. On others, such as the commonly grown forms of [[Coleus]], the variegation can vary widely within a population.

In ''[[Nymphaea lotus]]'', the tiger lotus, leaf variegations appear under intense illumination.

=== Pathological ===

[[Virus]] infections may cause patterning to appear on the leaf surface. The patterning is often characteristic of the infection. Examples are the ''mosaic viruses'', which produce a mosaic-type effect on the leaf surface or the [[citrus variegation virus]] (CVV). Recently{{when?|date=January 2017}} a virus disease, hosta virus X (HVX) has been identified that causes mottled leaf coloring in [[hostas]]. At first, diseased plants were propagated and grown for their mottled foliage, at the risk of infecting other healthy hostas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hosta Virus X|url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/viruses/hosta-virus-x.aspx|website=Missouri Botanical Garden|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these diseases are usually serious enough that the gardener would not grow affected plants, there are a few affected plants that can survive indefinitely, and are attractive enough to be grown for ornament; e.g. some variegated [[Abutilon]] varieties.

[[Nutrient]] deficiency symptoms may cause a temporary or variable yellowing in specific zones on the leaf. [[Iron]] and [[magnesium]] deficiencies are common causes of this.

[[Transposable element]]s can cause colour variegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbara McClintock and the Discovery of Jumping Genes (Transposons)|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/barbara-mcclintock-and-the-discovery-of-jumping-34083#|website=Nature|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defensive masquerade ==
It has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a defensive "masquerade strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lev-Yadun |first=S. |date=2014 |title=Defensive masquerade by plants |url= |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |publisher= |volume=113 |issue= |pages=1162–1166 |doi=10.1111/bij.12399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, leaf variegation may appear to an insect [[leaf miner]] that the leaf is already infested, and this may reduce parasitization of the leaf by leaf miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8108000/8108940.stm |title=The plant that pretends to be ill |last1=Walker |first1=Matt |date=19 June 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==

By convention, the italicised term ''variegata'' as the second part of the Latin [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name, indicates a [[species]] found in the wild with variegation (''[[Aloe variegata]]''). The much more common, non-italicised, inclusion of 'Variegata' as the third element of a name indicates a variegated [[cultivar]] of an unvariegated parent (''[[Aucuba japonica]]'' 'Variegata'). However, not all variegated plants have this Latin tag, for instance many cultivars of ''[[Pelargonium]]'' have some zonal variegation in their leaves. Other types of variegation may be indicated, e.g. ''[[Daphne odora]]'' 'Aureomarginata' has yellow edging on its leaves.

== Garden plants ==
[[Image:Variegated foliage.JPG|thumb|right|Variegated foliage used in an English garden. Plants shown include ''Aralia elata'' 'Aureovariegata' and ''Carex ornithopoda'' 'Variegata']]

Variegated plants have long been valued by gardeners, as the usually lighter-coloured variegation can 'lift' what would otherwise be blocks of solid green foliage. Many gardening societies have specialist variegated plants groups, such as the [[Hardy Plant Society]]'s Variegated Plant Special Interest Group in the UK. Several gardening books which deal exclusively with variegated plants are available.

The '''Venus Butterfly''' is a term used for various [[Human sexual activity|sexual techniques]], one of which being the subject of the 1988 book ''The One Hour Orgasm.'' It was first publicly mentioned in a 1986 episode of the American television drama ''[[L.A. Law]],'' although a technique of the same name appears in the book ''[[The Sensuous Woman]],'' which was first published in 1969.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
==''L.A. Law'' television episode==
In an episode of ''[[L.A. Law]]'' titled "The Venus Butterfly", which first aired on November 21, 1986, a man who is unimpressive in appearance and personality, but who nevertheless has tremendous success with women, claims to have a sexual technique that has caused this success, and reveals it to his lawyer, Stuart Markowitz ([[Michael Tucker (actor)|Michael Tucker]]). The technique itself is never described to the audience. In a hotel bedroom scene it is implied that Markowitz uses the technique on his girlfriend, Ann Kelsey ([[Jill Eikenberry]]), with great positive effect. According to authors Tim Brooks &amp; Earle Marsh, the Venus Butterfly was pivotal in Kelsey and Markowitz becoming a long-term couple.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks &amp; Earle Marsh, "The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Show, 1946–present."&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer of that section of the episode, [[Terry Louise Fisher]], stated that she had just made it up. The show received many letters and phone calls from viewers asking what it was, as well as two requests to license the term.&lt;ref name="cosmo"&gt;[http://srino.com/dey/susan_dey_cosmopolitan.html A Behind the Scenes Look at L.A. Law], ''Cosmopolitan,'' December 1987 (reprint on fansite, retrieved 23:45, August 12, 2006 (UTC))&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine did a feature speculating on what the technique was and included suggestions from readers. Years later, actors on the show reported still being asked about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Insider/default.htm?cmsRedir=true&amp;rmDate=01242002&amp;cmsGuid=%7BD3C490A0-5D62-43EE-9396-D7D9C2136669%7D Daniel R. Coleridge, "L.A. Law Reunion's Sexy Secret!" ''[[TV Guide]],'' January 24, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sue Johanson variation==
As described by writer and sex educator [[Sue Johanson]] in 2005, the Venus Butterfly is a variant of [[cunnilingus]]. It involves using one's tongue on a woman's [[clitoris]], using one's fingers on her [[vagina]] and using the other hand in the perineal area, "even penetrating the rectum [i.e. anus] if that is pleasurable for her."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talksexwithsue.com/oralfemale.php Performing Oral Sex on a Female] Talk Sex Productions Inc. &amp; Sue Johanson 2005, URL accessed August 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar description was given in a 2004 episode of the TV series ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]].''&lt;ref&gt;Colloquially, this configuration is also known as The Shocker.

==''The One Hour Orgasm'' variation==
The 1988 book ''The One Hour Orgasm: How to Learn the Amazing "Venus Butterfly" Technique,'' written by Leah and Bob Schwartz, is dedicated to educating readers on how to perform the technique. In this variation either the woman or man is lying down, and their partner, sitting next to them with their legs positioned around each other, very gently, with just the minimal amount of pressure (the "touch" of a butterfly's wing, at least on the clitoris) stimulates the clitoris or the hood, with the penis at the two-o'clock or ten-o'clock position. The book suggests keeping the clitoral shaft steady with one thumb laid gently along and beside it, with the other thumb lying lengthwise just within the vagina but not moving deep within it. (All of this is done using a lubricant.) The light pressure continues using the same speed throughout until a peak is reached close to orgasm but not quite (although it can be continued if multiple orgasms are the goal), then the speed is slowed down even further or stopped, but very soon continued again and the person is brought back near orgasm or given a second or third orgasm. This [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] on the part of the person providing the technique can be learned over time with a particular partner. The technique can be sustained, "surfing" near the orgasm but stopping occasionally, for a very long time, hence the term "One Hour Orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;''The One Hour Orgasm: How to Learn the Amazing "Venus Butterfly" Technique,'' a book written by Leah and Bob Schwartz, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is mentioned in the film ''[[Meet the Fockers]].'' A set of video-tapes (for him, and for her) were later made by the Schwartzes, showing how the technique is performed.
