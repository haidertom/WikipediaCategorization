'''''Active Exploits''''' is a [[diceless role-playing game|diceless]] set of role-playing game rules by [[Precis Intermedia Gaming]]. The core rules (which contain no setting) are distributed for free as a [[pdf]] file, or for a fee as a printed book. There are a number of published game settings and official game conversions which use these rules.

The system is considered innovative, but more in common with [[GURPS]] and [[Unisystem]], rather than other diceless games such as [[Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game|Amber]] and [[Nobilis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11964.phtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has options for [[freeform role-playing|freeform]] and [[live action role-playing]], as well as for converting the game to other systems.  Ample conversion rules allow the adaptation of the engine to a number of commercial systems.

== Published Settings and Official Conversions ==
Active Exploit has converted other published RPGs into diceless versions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15497">'''Attribute substitution''', also known as '''Substitution bias''', is a psychological process thought to underlie a number of [[cognitive bias]]es and [[optical illusion|perceptual illusions]]. It occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] attribute''.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |first2=David A. |last2=Lagnado |first3=David R. |last3=Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=978-1-84169-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Associative processes in intuitive judgment|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S1364661310001713/abstract|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2010-01-10|issn = 1364-6613|pmid = 20696611|pages = 435–440|volume = 14|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|language = English|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Kahneman|pmc = 5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

The theory of attribute substitution unifies a number of separate explanations of reasoning errors in terms of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|cognitive heuristics]].&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt; In turn, the theory is subsumed by an ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]], which states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In a 1974 paper, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] argued that a broad family of biases (systematic errors in judgment and decision) were explainable in terms of a few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including [[availability heuristic|availability]] and [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]]. In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick  |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g., the brightness of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded neurally in a way that is independent of [[stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be unrelated.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

== Conditions ==
{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450 |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible. Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible. This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life who is then asked about their happiness might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than answer the question as asked.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system. For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |publisher=American Economic Association |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

==Examples==
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This illusion works because 3D (perspective) size is substituted for 2D size (all pairs are equal in size)]]

===Optical illusions===
Attribute substitution explains the persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt;

===Valuing insurance===
Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. The former group were willing to pay more even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.

===Stereotypes===
[[Stereotypes]] can be a source of heuristic attributes.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt; In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a [[stereotype]] about the relative [[intelligence]] of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.

===Morality and fairness===
[[Cass Sunstein|Sunstein]] argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]], or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral Heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of [[Authority bias|trusted]] political or religious [[Argument from authority|authorities]] can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |accessdate=2009-09-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021623/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics demanded more evidence from Sunstein.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author-link2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer|first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer  |date=March 2008 |title=Heuristics Made Easy: An Effort-Reduction Framework |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=207–222 |issn=1939-1455 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.207 |pmid=18298269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beautiful-is-familiar effect===
Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monin |first=Benoît |first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in the familiarity data is accounted for by attractiveness.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==Evidence==
The most direct evidence, according to Kahneman,&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt; is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of Tom&amp;nbsp;W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–51 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's ''similarity'' to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate ''how likely'' it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by [[probability]], then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom is more likely to be a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4697">The '''United Nations Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States''', popularly referred to as the '''Barbados Program of Action''' ('''BPOA'''), is a policy document that both: comprehensively addresses the economic, environmental, and social developmental vulnerabilities facing islands; and outlines a strategy that seeks to mitigate those vulnerabilities. It remains the only internationally approved programme specific to [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) which has been collectively and unanimously endorsed by SIDS.

== Development of the BPOA ==
The full text of the BPOA was produced in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]] in 1994 at the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, a conference mandated by United Nations [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] 47/189. The need for an islands specific conference was highlighted some two years prior at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]), held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where 179 governments voted to adopt [[Agenda 21]]. Chapter 17, section G of [[Agenda 21]] acknowledges that "small island developing states are a special case both for environment and development ... [and] are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and sealevel rise."

== BPOA+5 ==
In 1999, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of the BPOA (BPOA +5). The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing [[globalization]], widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] (S-22/2) promised further action.

== BPOA+10 ==
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] ([[Earth Summit 2002]]) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]], the BPOA, and other international agreements. To this end, it recommended the convening of an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN passed [[Resolution (law)|Resolutions]] 57/262 and 58/213, which mandated an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to take place. The meeting was held in [[Port Louis, Mauritius]] between January 10-14, 2005. The final report emerging from this meeting significantly revised the original BPOA, and verified what previous reviews were alluding to, that the implementation of the BPOA had been largely unsuccessful. What emerged from it was a reorganising of the Programs "priority areas" and an entrenched commitment to the notion that economic growth would ultimately contribute to sustainable development.

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Other''', part of a thought experiment, is any other than the mind of the individual thinking about the experiment. The Other includes the individual's own body. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to consciousness, such that you cannot ever bridge the space between your own consciousness and that of another.

This "other" is in essence theoretical, since one cannot ever be [[empirical]]ly shown such an "other."

Put differently, Descartes concluded ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'', "I think, therefore I am," that is, that the presence of a self of which to speak (an "I") proves its existence to oneself; however, according to his [[Descartes#Philosophical work|Wax Argument]], one could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the "other."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1252">[[Chemotactic]] responses elicited by the [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] interactions are distinguished generally upon the optimal effective concentration(s) of the ligand. Nevertheless, correlation of the amplitude elicited and ratio of the responder cells compared to the total number are also characteristic features of the chemotactic signaling. Investigations of ligand families (e.g. [[amino acids]] or [[oligopeptide]]s) proved that there is a fitting of ranges (amplitudes; number of responder cells) and chemotactic activities: [[chemoattractant]] moiety is accompanied with wide, while [[chemorepellent]] character narrow ranges.

They are ''[[adaptive]]'' in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to the change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAS-T-02/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller, John H., and Scott E.

== Overview ==
The term ''complex adaptive systems'', or ''[[complexity science]]'', is often used to describe the loosely organized academic field that has grown up around the study of such systems.  Complexity science is not a single theory&amp;mdash;it encompasses more than one theoretical framework and is highly interdisciplinary, seeking the answers to some fundamental questions about [[life|living]], adaptable, changeable systems. The study of CAS focuses on complex, emergent and macroscopic properties of the system.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-13" /&gt; [[John Henry Holland|John H. Holland]] said that CAS "are systems that have a large numbers of components, often called agents, that interact and adapt or learn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Studying Complex Adaptive Systems|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/41486|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s11424-006-0001-z|author=Holland John H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical examples of complex adaptive systems include: climate; cities; firms; markets; governments; industries; ecosystems; social networks; power grids; animal swarms; traffic flows; [[social insect]] (e.g. [[ant]]) colonies;&lt;ref name=AFC-NA-21/&gt; the [[brain]] and the [[immune system]]; and the [[cell (biology)|cell]] and the developing [[embryo]]. Human social group-based endeavors, such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] [[organisations|organizations]], [[war]], and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] are also considered CAS.&lt;ref name=AFC-NA-21/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT-33/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAS-T-19&gt;{{cite web|first=Samuel|last=Solvit|title=Dimensions of War: Understanding War as a Complex Adaptive System|url=http://dimensionsofwar.com/|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2012|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[internet]] and [[cyberspace]]—composed, collaborated, and managed by a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s, is also regarded as a complex adaptive system.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAS-T-18/&gt; CAS can be hierarchical, but more often exhibit aspects of "self-organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/970420200|title=Hidden order : how adaptation builds complexity|last=Holland, John H.

=== General properties ===
What distinguishes a CAS from a pure [[multi-agent system]] (MAS) is the focus on top-level properties and features like [[self-similarity]], [[complexity]], [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. A MAS is defined as a system composed of multiple interacting agents; whereas in CAS, the agents as well as the system are adaptive and the system is [[self-similar]]. A CAS is a complex, self-similar collectivity of interacting, adaptive agents.  Complex Adaptive Systems are characterized by a high degree of [[adaptive capacity]], giving them resilience in the face of [[wikt:perturbation|perturbation]].

Other important properties are adaptation (or [[homeostasis]]), communication, cooperation, specialization, spatial and temporal organization, and reproduction. They can be found on all levels: cells specialize,  adapt and reproduce themselves just like larger organisms do. Communication and cooperation take place on all levels, from the agent to the system level. The forces driving [[co-operation]] between agents in such a system, in some cases, can be analyzed with [[game theory]].

=== Characteristics ===

Some of the most important characteristics of complex systems are:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cilliers]] (1998) ''Complexity and Postmodernism: Understanding Complex Systems''&lt;/ref&gt;

* The number of elements is sufficiently large that conventional descriptions (e.g. a system of [[differential equation]]s) are not only impractical, but cease to assist in understanding the system. Moreover, the elements interact dynamically, and the interactions can be physical or involve the exchange of information
* Such interactions are rich, i.e. any element or sub-system in the system is affected by and affects several other elements or sub-systems
* The interactions are [[non-linear]]: small changes in inputs, physical interactions or stimuli can cause large effects or very significant changes in outputs
* Interactions are primarily but not exclusively with immediate neighbours and the nature of the influence is modulated
* Any interaction can feed back onto itself directly or after a number of intervening stages. Such feedback can vary in quality.  This is known as ''recurrency''
* The overall behavior of the system of elements is not predicted by the behavior of the individual elements 
* Such systems may be open and it may be difficult or impossible to define system boundaries
* Complex systems operate under [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium]] conditions. There has to be a constant flow of energy to maintain the organization of the system
* Complex systems have a history. They evolve and their past is co-responsible for their present behaviour
* Elements in the system may be ignorant of the behaviour of the system as a whole, responding only to the information or physical stimuli available to them locally

[[Robert Axelrod]] &amp; [[Michael D. Cohen (academic)|Michael D. Cohen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Axelrod]] &amp; [[Michael D. Cohen (academic)|Michael D. Cohen]], ''Harnessing Complexity''. [[Basic Books]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; identify a series of key terms from a modeling perspective:
* '''Strategy''', a conditional action pattern that indicates what to do in which circumstances
* '''Artifact''', a material resource that has definite location and can respond to the action of agents
* '''Agent''', a collection of properties, strategies &amp; capabilities for interacting with artifacts &amp; other agents
* '''Population''', a collection of agents, or, in some situations, collections of strategies
* '''System''', a larger collection, including one or more populations of agents and possibly also artifacts
* '''Type''', all the agents (or strategies) in a population that have some characteristic in common
* '''Variety''', the diversity of types within a population or system
* '''Interaction pattern''', the recurring regularities of contact among types within a system
* '''Space (physical)''', location in geographical space &amp; time of agents and artifacts
* '''Space (conceptual)''', "location" in a set of categories structured so that "nearby" agents will tend to interact
* '''Selection''', processes that lead to an increase or decrease in the frequency of various types of agent or strategies
* '''Success criteria''' or '''performance measures''', a "score" used by an agent or designer in attributing credit in the selection of relatively successful (or unsuccessful) strategies or agents

== Modeling and simulation ==
CAS are occasionally modeled by means of [[agent-based model]]s and [[complex network]]-based models.&lt;ref&gt;Muaz A. K. Niazi, Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems [https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/3365 PhD Thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based models are developed by means of various methods and tools primarily by means of first identifying the different agents inside the model.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Miller &amp; Scott E. Page, Complex Adaptive Systems: An Introduction to Computational Models of Social Life, Princeton University Press [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8429.html Book page]&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of developing models for CAS involves developing complex network models by means of using interaction data of various CAS components.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Mitchell, Complexity A Guided Tour, Oxford University Press, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LifeSciences/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5NTEyNDQxNQ== Book page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[SpringerOpen|SpringerOpen/BioMed Central]] has launched an online open-access journal on the topic of ''complex adaptive systems modeling'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;Springer ''[https://casmodeling.springeropen.com/ Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal]'' (CASM)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of complexity ==

{{Main|Evolution of biological complexity}}

Living organisms are complex adaptive systems. Although complexity is hard to quantify in biology, [[evolution]] has produced some remarkably complex organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adami C |title=What is complexity? |journal=BioEssays |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1085–94 |year=2002 |pmid=12447974 |doi=10.1002/bies.10192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation has led to the common misconception of evolution being progressive and leading towards what are viewed as "higher organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McShea D |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303–24 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If this were generally true, evolution would possess an active trend towards complexity. As shown below, in this type of process the value of the most common amount of complexity would increase over time.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227|bibcode = 2001Natur.409.1102C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some [[artificial life]] simulations have suggested that the generation of CAS is an inescapable feature of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furusawa C, Kaneko K |title=Origin of complexity in multicellular organisms |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=84 |issue=26 Pt 1 |pages=6130–3 |year=2000 |pmid=10991141 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.6130 |bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.6130F|arxiv = nlin/0009008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adami C, Ofria C, Collier TC |title=Evolution of biological complexity |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/9/4463 |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=4463–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10781045 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.9.4463 |pmc=18257|arxiv = physics/0005074 |bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.4463A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the idea of a general trend towards complexity in evolution can also be explained through a passive process.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; This involves an increase in [[variance]] but the most common value, the [[mode (statistics)|mode]], does not change. Thus, the maximum level of complexity increases over time, but only as an indirect product of there being more organisms in total. This type of random process is also called a bounded [[random walk]].

In this hypothesis, the apparent trend towards more complex organisms is an illusion resulting from concentrating on the small number of large, very complex organisms that inhabit the [[Skewness|right-hand tail]] of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model emphasizes that the overwhelming majority of species are [[microorganism|microscopic]] [[prokaryote]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oren A |title=Prokaryote diversity and taxonomy: current status and future challenges |pmc=1693353 |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=623–38 |year=2004 |pmid=15253349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprise about half the world's [[biomass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitman W, Coleman D, Wiebe W | title = Prokaryotes: the unseen majority | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/12/6578 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6578–83 | year = 1998 |pmid = 9618454 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 | pmc = 33863|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and constitute the vast majority of Earth's biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schloss P, Handelsman J |title=Status of the microbial census  |pmc=539005 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15590780 |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=686–91 |year=2004 |pmid=15590780 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.68.4.686-691.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, simple life remains dominant on Earth, and complex life appears more diverse only because of [[sampling bias]].

If there is a lack of an overall trend towards complexity in biology, this would not preclude the existence of forces driving systems towards complexity in a subset of cases. These minor trends would be balanced by other evolutionary pressures that drive systems towards less complex states.

A '''conventional electrical unit''' (or '''conventional unit''' where there is no risk of ambiguity) is a [[unit of measurement]] in the field of [[electricity]] which is based on the so-called "conventional values" of the [[Josephson constant]] and the [[von Klitzing constant]] agreed by the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in 1988. These units are very similar in scale to their corresponding [[SI unit]]s, but are not identical because of their different definition. They are distinguished from the corresponding SI units by setting the symbol in italic typeface and adding a subscript "90" – e.g., the conventional volt has the symbol ''V''{{sub|90}} – as they came into international use on 1 January 1990.

This system was developed to increase the precision of measurements: The Josephson and von Klitzing constants can be realized with great precision, repeatability and ease.  The conventional electrical units have achieved acceptance as an international standard and are commonly used outside of the physics community in both engineering and industry.

The conventional electrical units are "quasi-[[natural units|natural]]" in the sense that they are completely and exactly defined in terms of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s.  They are the first set of measurement units to be defined in this way, and as such, represent a significant step towards using "natural" fundamental physics for practical measurement purposes.  However, the conventional electrical units are unlike other systems of natural units in that some physical constants are not set to unity but rather set to fixed numerical values that are very close (but not precisely the same) to those in the common [[SI]] system of units.

Four significant steps were taken in the last half century to increase the precision and utility of measurement units.  In 1967 the Thirteenth [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) defined the [[second]] of atomic time in the International System of Units as the duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom.  In 1983, the seventeenth CGPM redefined the [[metre]] in terms of the second and the speed of light, thus fixing the speed of light at exactly {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}.  And in 1990, the eighteenth CGPM adopted conventional values for the Josephson constant and the von Klitzing constant, fixing the conventional Josephson constant at exactly {{val|483597.9|e=9|u=Hz/''"V"''}}, and the conventional von Klitzing constant at exactly {{val|25812.807|u=''"Ω"''}} (again, these volts and ohms are not precisely the same as the SI definitions but very nearly equivalent).

==Definition==
Conventional electrical units are based on defined values of the [[Josephson constant]] and the [[von Klitzing constant]], which allow practical measurements of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance]] respectively. &lt;ref name=CODATA2014&gt;{{cite journal

*The conventional [[volt]], ''V''{{sub|90}}, is the electromotive force (or electric potential difference) measured against a [[Josephson effect]] standard using the defined value of the Josephson constant, ''K''{{sub|J–90}}. ''See [[Josephson voltage standard]].''
*The conventional [[ohm]], ''Ω''{{sub|90}}, is the electrical resistance measured against a [[quantum Hall effect]] standard using the defined value of the von Klitzing constant, ''R''{{sub|K–90}}.
*Other conventional electrical units are defined by the normal physical relationships, as in the conversion table below.

==Comparison with natural units==
{{See also|Natural units}}

Conventional electrical units can be thought of as a scaled version of a system of [[natural units]] defined as

:&lt;math&gt; c = e = \hbar = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

having consequence:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} = \alpha \ &lt;/math&gt; .

This is a more general (or less specific) version of either the particle physics "[[natural units]]" or the [[Natural units|quantum chromodynamical system of units]] but that no unit mass is fixed.  Like n.u. or QCD units, with conventional electrical units any observed variation over space or time in the value of the fine-structure constant, α, is attributed to variation in the Coulomb constant or [[vacuum permittivity]] or, since the speed of light, ''c'', is fixed, as a variation in the [[vacuum permeability]].

The following table provides a comparison of conventional electrical units with other natural unit systems:

While it has been considered a form of [[Industry self-regulation|corporate self-regulation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheehy|first=Benedict|date=2012|title=Understanding CSR: An Empirical Study of Private Regulation|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/2012/16.pdf|journal=Monash University Law Review|volume=38|pages=103–127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for some time, over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organisations, to mandatory schemes at regional, national and even transnational levels.

Considered at the organisational level, CSR is an organisational policy. As such, it must align with and be integrated into a [[business model]] to be successful.  With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory  requirements, and  engages in "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law".&lt;ref name=CPRtheory2001&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corporate social responsibility: A theory of the firm perspective |first1=Abagail |last1=McWilliams |first2=Donald |last2=Siegel |year=2001 |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=117–127 |doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSRinternational2005&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choices of 'complying' with the law, failing to comply, and 'going beyond' are three distinct strategic organisational choices. While in many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers may choose to comply with the law, or go beyond the law, other organisations may choose to flout the law. These organisations are taking on clear legal risks.  The nature of the legal risk, however, changes when attention is paid to [[soft law]].&lt;ref&gt;Klarsfeld, A., Delpuech, C. (2008).

Overall, businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes. From a strategic perspective, the aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Farrington |first2=Ross |last2=Curran |first3=Keith |last3=Gori |first4=Kevin D. |last4=O'Gorman |first5=C.

Proponents argue that [[corporation]]s increase long-term profits by operating with a CSR perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from businesses' economic role. A 2000 study compared existing [[econometric]] studies of the relationship between social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed [[empirical analysis]] and claimed when the study is properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes.&lt;ref name=CPRneutral2000&gt;{{cite journal

In line with this critical perspective, political and sociological [[New institutionalism|institutionalists]] became interested in CSR in the context of theories of [[globalization]], [[neoliberalism]] and [[late capitalism]]. Some institutionalists viewed CSR as a form of capitalist legitimacy and in particular point out that what began as a social movement against uninhibited [[corporate power]] was transformed by corporations into a 'business model' and a 'risk management' device, often with questionable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5893.2011.00439.x| title = Socially Responsible Private Regulation: World-Culture or World-Capitalism?| journal = Law &amp; Society Review| volume = 45| issue = 2| pages = 313–336| year = 2011| last1 = Shamir | first1 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSR is titled to aid an organization's mission as well as serve as a guide to what the company represents for its consumers. [[Business ethics]] is the part of [[applied ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment. [[ISO 26000]] is the recognized international standard for CSR. Public sector organizations (the United Nations for example) adhere to the [[triple bottom line]] (TBL). It is widely accepted that CSR adheres to similar principles, but with no formal act of legislation.

== Definition ==

Since the 1960s,{{sfn |De George |2011}} corporate social responsibility has attracted attention from a range of businesses and stakeholders. A wide variety of definitions have been developed but with little consensus. Part of the problem with definitions has arisen because of the different interests represented. A business person may define CSR as a business strategy, an NGO activist may see it as 'greenwash' while a government official may see it as voluntary regulation."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheehy|first=Benedict|date=2015-10-01|title=Defining CSR: Problems and Solutions|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=131|issue=3|pages=625–648|doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2281-x|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, disagreement about the definition will arise from the disciplinary approach."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For example, while an economist might consider the director's discretion necessary for CSR to be implemented a risk of agency costs, a law academic may consider that discretion to be an appropriate expression of what the law demands from directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommer|first=A.A. Jr|date=1991|title=Whom should the corporation serve? the Berle Dodd debate revisited sixty years later|url=|journal=Delaware Journal of Corporate Law|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheehy|first=Benedict|date=2014|title=Anglo-American Directors' Legal Duties and CSR: Prohibited, Permitted or Prescribed?|url=|journal=Dalhousie Law Journal|volume=31|pages=345|via=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/dalholwj37&amp;div=15&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate social responsibility has recently been defined by Sheehy as "international private business self-regulation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sheehy examined a range of different disciplinary approaches to defining CSR. The definitions reviewed included the economic definition of "sacrificing profits," a management definition of "beyond compliance", institutionalist views of CSR as a "socio-political movement" and law's own focus on directors' duties. Further, Sheehy considered Carroll's widely used description of CSR as a pyramid of responsibilities, namely, economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Archie B.|date=July 1991|title=The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders|journal=Business Horizons|volume=34|issue=4|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-g|issn=0007-6813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, while Carroll was not defining CSR but simply arguing for classification of activities, Sheehy developed a definition differently following the philosophy of science—the branch of philosophy used for defining phenomena.

Carroll 1991 extended corporate social responsibility from the traditional economic and legal responsibility to ethical and philanthropic responsibility in response to the rising concerns on ethical issues in businesses, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Archie B. |date=1991|title=The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: toward moral management of organizational stakeholders|url=|journal=Business Horizons|volume=34 |issue=4|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is reflected in the ''Business Dictionary'' which defines CSR as "A company's sense of responsibility towards the community and environment (both ecological and social) in which it operates. Companies express this citizenship (1) through their waste and pollution reduction processes, (2) by contributing educational and social programs and (3) by earning adequate returns on the employed resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corporate-social-responsibility.html |title=Definition of CSR |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most consumers agree that while achieving business targets, companies should engage in CSR efforts at the same time.{{sfn |Epstein-Reeves |2010}} Most consumers believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response.{{sfn |Somerville |2013}} Somerville also found that consumers are loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity.

A more common approach to CSR is corporate [[philanthropy]]. This includes monetary donations and aid given to nonprofit organizations and communities. Donations are made in areas such as the arts, education, housing, health, social welfare and the environment, among others, but excluding political contributions and commercial event sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilcsik |first=András |last2=Marquis |first2=Christopher |title=Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities |journal=Administrative Science Quarterly |date=1 February 2013 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=111–148 |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |accessdate=19 January 2018 |doi=10.1177/0001839213475800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into operations, such as procurement of [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] tea and coffee.

[[Creating shared value]] or CSV is based on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent. A business needs a healthy, educated workforce, sustainable resources and adept government to compete effectively. For society to thrive, profitable and competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income, wealth, tax revenues and philanthropy. The Harvard Business Review article ''Strategy &amp; Society: The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility'' provided examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and CSR.{{sfn |Porter |Kramer |2006}} CSV acknowledges trade-offs between short-term profitability and social or environmental goals, but emphasizes the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy. CSV gives the impression that only two stakeholders are important - shareholders and consumers.

Many companies employ [[benchmarking]] to assess their CSR policy, implementation and effectiveness. Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor initiatives, as well as measuring and evaluating the impact that those policies have on society and the environment, and how others perceive competitor CSR strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoessle|first= Ulrike|title= Ten Steps Toward a Sustainable Business (WWS Series 1 Seattle 2013)| isbn =978-0-9898270-0-3|url= http://www.wwsworldwide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-benefit analysis ===

In competitive markets [[cost-benefit analysis]] of CSR initiatives can be examined using a [[resource-based view]] (RBV). According to Barney (1990), "formulation of the RBV, sustainable competitive advantage requires that resources be valuable (V), rare (R), inimitable (I) and non-substitutable (S)."&lt;ref name=BarneyRBV&gt;
{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/014920639101700108| title = Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage| journal = Journal of Management| volume = 17| pages = 99–120| year = 1991| last1 = Barney | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBV&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/smj.4250050207| title = A resource-based view of the firm| journal = Strategic Management Journal| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 171–180| year = 1984| last1 = Wernerfelt | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A firm introducing a CSR-based strategy might only sustain high returns on their investment if their CSR-based strategy could not be copied (I). However, should competitors imitate such a strategy, that might increase overall social benefits. Firms that choose CSR for strategic financial gain are also acting responsibly.

RBV presumes that firms are bundles of heterogeneous resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers can determine the appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting cost benefit analysis in the same way that they analyze other investments. Reinhardt (1998) found that a firm engaging in a CSR-based strategy could only sustain an abnormal return if it could prevent competitors from imitating its strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=Donald S. |year=2009 |title=Green Management Matters Only If It Yields More Green: An Economic/Strategic Perspective |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/jmswpaper/8.htm |publisher= Academy of Management Perspectives |volume= 23 |issue=3 |pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moreover, when it comes to cost benefit analysis, you should look at Waddock and Graves (1997), who showed that corporate social performance was positively linked to financial performance, meaning that the benefit of being socially responsible outweigh the costs.  McWilliams and Siegel (2000) noted that Waddock and Graves hadn’t taken innovation into account, that companies that did CSR were also very innovative, and that the innovation drove financial performance, not CSR. Hull and Rothenberg (2007) then found that when companies are not innovative, a history of CSR does in fact help financial performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hull|first=Clyde|last2=ROTHENBERG|first2=SANDRA|date=February 2008|title=Firm Performance: The Interactions of Corporate Social Performance with Innovation and Industry Differentiation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bd04/2027709bca590b8c2b68bf74be39148f64d9.pdf|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=Strat. Mgmt. J. , 29 : 781 – 789|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

Initially, CSR emphasized the official behaviour of individual firms. Later, it expanded to include supplier behaviour and the uses to which products were put and how they were disposed of after they lost value.

=== Supply chain ===
In the 21st century, corporate social responsibility in the supply chain has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders. Corporations' supply chain is the process by which several organizations including suppliers, customers and logistics providers work together to provide a value package of products and services to the end user, who is the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Designing and managing the supply chain|last=Simchi-Levi;kaminsky, D.P|first=Levi;D., P|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate social irresponsibility in the supply chain has greatly affected the reputation of companies, leading to a lot of cost to solve the problems. For instance, incidents like the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], which killed over 1000 people, pushed companies to consider the impacts of their operations on society and environment. On the other side, the horse meat scandal of 2013 in the United Kingdom affected many food retailers, including Tesco, the largest retailer in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9891296/Horsemeat-scandal-supermarkets-have-failed-to-check-meat-suppliers-MPs-told.html |title=Horsemeat scandal: supermarkets have failed to check meat suppliers, MPs told|first=Rowena|last=Mason|date=24 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the dismissal of the supplier. Corporate social irresponsibility from both the suppliers and the retailers has greatly affected the stakeholders who lost trust for the affected business entities, and despite the fact that sometimes it's not directly undertaken by the companies, they become accountable to the stakeholders. These surrounding issues have prompted [[supply chain management]] to consider the corporate social responsibility context. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggested that companies need to include social responsibility in their reviews of component quality. They highlighted the use of technology in improving visibility across the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andreas |last=Wieland |first2=Robert B. |last2=Handfield |year=2013 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=90423931&amp;site=ehost-live |title=The Socially Responsible Supply Chain: An Imperative for Global Corporations |journal=Supply Chain Management Review |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages=22–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social initiatives===
Corporate social responsibility includes six types of corporate social initiatives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Nancy|last2=Kotler|first2=Philip|title=Corporate social responsibility doing the most good for your company and your cause|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118045770}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporate philanthropy: company donations to charity, including cash, goods, and services, sometimes via a corporate foundation
* Community volunteering: company-organized volunteer activities, sometimes while an employee receives pay for pro-bono work on behalf of a non-profit organization
* Socially-responsible business practices: ethically produced products which appeal to a customer segment
* Cause promotions: company-funded advocacy campaigns
* Cause-related marketing: donations to charity based on product sales
* Corporate social marketing: company-funded behavior-change campaigns

All six of the corporate initiatives are forms of corporate citizenship. However, only some of these CSR activities rise to the level of [[cause marketing]], defined as "a type of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in which a company's promotional campaign has the dual purpose of increasing profitability while bettering society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Organ|first1=Michael|title=Cause Marketing — Definition|url=https://causemarketing.com/research/cause-marketing-definition/|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies generally do not have a [[profit motive]] when participating in corporate philanthropy and community volunteering. On the other hand, the remaining corporate social initiatives can be examples of cause marketing, in which there is both a societal interest and profit motive.

== Implementation ==

CSR may be based within the [[human resources]], [[business development]] or [[public relations]] departments of an organisation,&lt;ref name=careers&gt;{{cite web

An engagement plan can assist in reaching a desired audience. A corporate social responsibility individual or team plans the [[goal]]s and [[Goal|objectives]] of the organization. As with any corporate activity, a defined budget demonstrates commitment and scales the program's relative importance.

=== Accounting, auditing and reporting ===
{{Main |Social accounting}}

[[Social accounting]] is the communication of social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-02630-0_2| chapter = Corporate Responsibility, Accounting and Accountants| title = Professionals' Perspectives of Corporate Social Responsibility| pages = 11–32| year = 2009| last1 = Tilt | first1 = C. A. | isbn = 978-3-642-02629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate [[accountability]]. Crowther defines social accounting as "an approach to reporting a firm's activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behavior, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques."&lt;ref name="Crowther2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Crowther |title=Social and Environmental Accounting |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QLYCAAAACAAJ |p=20}} |year=2000 |publisher=Financial Times/Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-273-65092-8 |p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reporting guidelines and standards serve as frameworks for social accounting, auditing and reporting:

In nations such as France, legal requirements for social accounting, auditing and reporting exist, though international or national agreement on meaningful measurements of social and environmental performance has not been achieved. Many companies produce externally audited annual reports that cover [[Sustainable Development]] and CSR issues ("Triple Bottom Line Reports"), but the reports vary widely in format, style, and [[evaluation]] [[methodology]] (even within the same industry). Critics dismiss these reports as lip service, citing examples such as [[Enron]]'s yearly "Corporate Responsibility Annual Report" and tobacco companies' social reports.

In South Africa, as of June 2010, all companies listed on the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange]] (JSE) were required to produce an [[Integrated reporting|integrated report]] in place of an annual financial report and sustainability report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pr |url= https://www.saica.co.za/tabid/695/itemid/2344/language/en-ZA/An-integrated-report-is-a-new-requirement-for-list.aspx |title=News Articles and Press &amp; media releases |publisher=South African Institute of Chartered Accountants |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An integrated report reviews environmental, social and economic performance alongside financial performance. This requirement was implemented in the absence of formal or legal standards. An Integrated Reporting Committee (IRC) was established to issue guidelines for good practice.

One of the reputable institutions that capital markets turn to for credible sustainability reports is the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]], or CDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.esg.adec-innovations.com/blog/bid/311299/the-benefit-of-corporate-social-responsibility-csr-reporting The Benefit of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verification ===
Corporate social responsibility and its resulting reports and efforts should be verified by the consumer of the goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool |url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services |publisher=U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accounting, auditing and reporting resources provide a foundation for consumers to verify that their products are [[Social sustainability|socially sustainable]]. Due to an increased awareness of the need for CSR, many industries have their own verification resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/542/resources-verifying-sustainable-products |title=Resources for Verifying Sustainable Products  - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool |publisher=U.S. General Services Administration |access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The include organizations like the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (paper and forest products), [http://www.cocoainitiative.org/ International Cocoa Initiative], and [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberly Process]] (diamonds). The United Nations also provides frameworks not only for verification, but for reporting of human rights violations in corporate supply chains.

=== Ethics training ===

The rise of ethics training inside corporations, some of it required by government regulation, has helped CSR to spread. The aim of such training is to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tullberg |first1=J. |last2=Tullberg |first2=S. |year=1996 |title=On Human Altruism: The Discrepancy between Normative and Factual Conclusions |journal=Oikos |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=327–329 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/3546259 |jstor=3546259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of "dirty hands",{{sfn |Grace |Cohen |2004}} fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms. Organizations see increased employee loyalty and pride in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/pages/0907agenda_training.aspx|title=Supporting Ethical Employees|last=Thilmany|first=Jean|date=2007|website=HR Magazine|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common actions ===

Common CSR actions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Tegan |title=Talent Management |url=http://talentmgt.com/articles/view/the_business_value_of_virtue_corporate_social_responsibility_and_employee_engagement/1 |work=The Business Value of Virtue: Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental sustainability: recycling, waste management, water management, renewable energy, reusable materials, 'greener' supply chains, reducing paper use and adopting [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) building standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Richard |title=The Green Market Oracle |url=http://thegreenmarketoracle.com/2012/01/top-sustainability-trends-for.html |work=Top Business Sustainability Trends for 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2012-01-26 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Forest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Forest |url=http://www.greatforest.com/services.html |work=Services |accessdate=2013-11-19 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152417/http://greatforest.com/services.html |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Environmental Leader |url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/01/14/microsoft-kpmg-ey-lead-sustainability-survey/ |work=Top Sustainability Consultants Revealed |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2013-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006160850/http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/01/14/microsoft-kpmg-ey-lead-sustainability-survey/ |archivedate=2013-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community involvement: This can include raising money for local charities, providing volunteers, sponsoring local events, employing local workers, supporting local economic growth, engaging in fair trade practices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Camden Community Empowerment Network |url=http://www.camdencen.org.uk/jargonbuster.htm |work=Camden Community Empowerment Network Jargon Buster |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Workforce Management |url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/starbucks-is-pleasing-employees-and-pouring-profits |work=Starbucks is Pleasing Employees and Pouring Profits |accessdate=2013-11-19 |pages=58–59 |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethical marketing]]: Companies that ethically market to consumers are placing a higher value on their customers and respecting them as people who are ends in themselves. They do not try to manipulate or falsely advertise to potential consumers. This is important for companies that want to be viewed as ethical.

=== Social license to operate ===

Social License to Operate can be determined as a contractual grounds for the legitimacy of activities and projects company is involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Demuijnck|first=Geert|last2=Fasterling|first2=Björn|date=2016-01-15|title=The Social License to Operate|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-015-2976-7|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=136|issue=4|pages=675–685|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2976-7|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the level of support and approval of a company’s activities by its stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gehman|first=Joel|last2=Lefsrud|first2=Lianne M.|last3=Fast|first3=Stewart|date=2017-06-01|title=Social license to operate: Legitimacy by another name?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/capa.12218/epdf|journal=Canadian Public Administration|language=en|volume=60|issue=2|doi=10.1111/capa.12218/epdf|issn=1754-7121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displaying commitment to CSR is one way to achieve social license, by enhancing a company's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/eta/PES_2013_summitpaper_Yates_Horvath.pdf|title=Social License to Operate: How to Get It, and How to Keep It|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in ''Enduring value:'' the Australian minerals industry framework for sustainable development the concept of the 'social license to operate', then defined simply as obtaining and maintaining broad community support and acceptance. Unless a company earns and maintains that license social license holders may intend to block project developments; employees may leave the company for a company that is a better corporate citizen: and companies may be under ongoing legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.minerals.org.au/enduring-value-framework|title=Enduring Value Framework|date=2017-04-10|work=Minerals Council of Australia|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In research of [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] Dr [[Elliott Jaques]] defines Social License to Operate for the company as the social contract the company has with the social license holders (employees, trade unions, communities, government)  for them to manifest positive intention to support the business short- and long-term objectives by ''“providing managerial leadership that nurtures the social good and also gives the foundation for sustainable growth in organizational results.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/478621081|title=Social power and the CEO : leadership and trust in a sustainable free enterprise system|last=Elliott|first=Jaques,|date=2002|publisher=Quorum Books|isbn=1567205518|oclc=478621081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective for the companies is to obtain and maintain the Social License to Operate. Based on the [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] research of Dr. Elliott Jaques to achieve this goal a company needs to:
* Identify the business strategy and business objectives
* Identify the social license holders (employees of a company, labour unions, local and national governments, communities, activist groups, etc.) for every business objectives
* Identify the support that the company desires to achieve from the social license holders by specifying for every business objective social license elements (target of support, context of support, time of support, action of support)
* Quantitatively measure the intention (positive or negative) of the social license holders to support the business objectives
* Identify the factors that negatively impact the intention of the social license holders to support the business objectives (strength of their belief in support, their evaluation of support outcomes, pressure to provide support, enablers / disablers of support, etc.)
* Develop the Social License Development Strategy to remove the negative factors and ensure positive intention of all the social license holders to support all the business objectives of the company.
* Perform ongoing monitoring and quantitative measurement of changes in the Social License to Operate of the company   

== Potential business benefits ==

A large body of literature exhorts business to adopt non-financial measures of success (e.g., [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]'s Fourteen Points, [[balanced scorecard]]s). While CSR benefits are hard to quantify, Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.finanzasostenibile.it/finanza/moskowitz2004.pdf |title=Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis |first=Marc |last=Orlitzky |author2=Frank L. Schmidt |author3=Sara L. Rynes |journal=Organization Studies |year=2003 |format=PDF |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=403–441 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=London |accessdate=2008-03-07 |doi=10.1177/0170840603024003910 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929182545/http://www.finanzasostenibile.it/finanza/moskowitz2004.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a correlation between social/environmental performance and financial performance.

The [[business case]] for CSR{{sfn |Bhattacharya |Sen |Korschun |2011}} within a company employs one or more of these arguments:

=== Triple bottom line ===

"People, planet and profit", also known as the triple bottom line, form one way to evaluate CSR.
"People" refers to fair labour practices, the community and region where the business operates.
"Planet" refers to sustainable environmental practices. [[Profit (economics)|Profit]] is the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital (unlike accounting definitions of profit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gopal K. |last=Kanj |first2=Parvesh K. |last2=Chopra |year=2010 |title=Corporate Social Responsibility in a Global Economy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news

 | title=Idea: Triple bottom line
 | date= 2009-11-17
 | accessdate= 2016-01-07
 | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was claimed to help some companies be more conscious of their social and moral responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/|title=Moral Responsibility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics claim that it is selective and substitutes a company's perspective for that of the community. Another criticism is about the absence of a standard auditing procedure.{{sfn |De George |2011 |p=205}}

The term was coined by John Elkington in 1994.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

=== Human resources ===

A CSR program can be an aid to [[recruitment]] and [[Employee retention|retention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=C.B. |first2=Sankar |last2=Sen |first3=Daniel |last3=Korschun |year=2008 |title=Using Corporate Social Responsibility to Win the War for Talent |publisher=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=37–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly within the competitive [[graduate school|graduate]] student market. Potential recruits often consider a firm's CSR policy. CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff, particularly when staff can become involved through [[payroll giving]], [[fundraising]] activities or community volunteering. CSR has been credited with encouraging customer orientation among customer-facing employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1509/jm.11.0245| title = Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Orientation, and the Job Performance of Frontline Employees| journal = Journal of Marketing| volume = 78| issue = 3| pages = 20–37| year = 2014| last1 = Korschun | first1 = D. | last2 = Bhattacharya | first2 = C. B. | last3 = Swain | first3 = S. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSR is known for impacting [[employee turnover]]. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and that the ability to retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Galbreath (2010-06-29). "How does corporate social responsibility benefit firms? Evidence from Australia". ''European Business Review''. 22 (4): 411-431. doi:10.1108/09555341011056186. ISSN 0955-534X.&lt;/ref&gt; Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valentine | first1 = S. | last2 = Godkin | first2 = L. | last3 = Fleischman | first3 = G.

The [[Institute for Business Value|IBM Institute for Business Value]] conducted a survey of 250 business leaders worldwide in 2008. The survey found out that businesses have assimilated a much more strategic view, and that 68% companies reported are utilizing CSR as an opportunity and part of a sustainable growth strategy. The authors noted that while developing and implementing a CSR strategy represents a unique opportunity to benefit the company. However, only 31% of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company's CSR objectives and initiatives. The survey's authors also stated that employee engagement on CSR initiatives can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. As a result, employees tend to discard employers with a bad reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mandrake.ca/bill/images/corporate_responsibility_white_paper.pdf |title=Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement: Making the Connection |first=Rob |last=Gross |work=www.mandrake.ca |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk management ===

Managing [[risk]] is an important executive responsibility. Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through corruption scandals or environmental accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=A.B. |last2=Ghardwaj |first2=G. |year=2011 |title= Corporate Social Responsibility: Does Social Responsibility Help Protect a Company's Reputation? |journal=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=52 (March) |pages=18–18 |url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/the-magazine/2011-spring/52313/does-social-responsibility-help-protect-a-companys-reputation/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These draw unwanted attention from regulators, courts, governments and media. CSR can limit these risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies use their commitment to CSR as their primary positioning tool, e.g., [[The Co-operative Group]], [[The Body Shop]] and [[American Apparel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/28/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx Dr. Tantillo's 30-Second 'How To': How To Brand CSR The American Apparel Way"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429132810/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/28/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx |date=April 29, 2013 }} Marketing Doctor Blog. March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets, helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions as another form of advertising.{{sfn|Fry|Keim|Meiners|1982|p=105}}

Companies that operate strong CSR activities tend to drive customer's attention to buy products or services regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers are aware of the company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. Lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kemper | first1 = J. | last2 = Shilke | first2 = O. | last3 = Reimann | first3 = M. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Brettel | first5 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Competition-motivated corporate social responsibility | url = | journal = Journal of Business Research | volume = 66 | issue = 10| page = 1954 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whole Foods]]' marketing and promotion of organic foods have had a positive effect on the supermarket industry. Proponents assert that Whole Foods has been able to work with its suppliers to improve animal treatment and quality of meat offered in their stores. They also promote local agricultures in over 2,400 independent farms to maintain their line of sustainable organic produce. As a result, Whole Foods' high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. In fact, they are pleased buying organic products that come from sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, J., &amp; Vivari, B. (2009). Chapter 11: United States of America: Internal Commitments and External Pressures. In Global Practices of Corporate Social Responsibility (pp. 235-250). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, there are three theaters of practice in which CSR can be divided. Theater one focuses on philanthropy, which includes donations of money or equipment to non-profit organizations, engagement with communities' initiatives and employee volunteering. This is characterized as the "soul" of a company, expressing the social and environmental priorities of the founders. The authors assert that companies engage in CSR because they are an integral part of the society. The [[Coca-Cola Company]] contributes with $88.1 million annually to a variety of environmental educational and humanitarian organization. Another example is [[PNC Financial Services]]' "Grow Up Great" childhood education program. This program provides critical school readiness resources to underserved communities where PNC operates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rangan, Kasturi; Chase, Lisa; Karim, Sohel. [https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-truth-about-csr "The Truth About CSR"]. ''www.hbr.org''. Harvard Business Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, theater two focuses on improving operational effectiveness in the workplace. The researchers assert that programs in this theater strive to deliver social or environmental benefits to support a company's operation across the value chain by improving efficiency. Some of the examples mentioned include sustainability initiatives to reduce resource use, waste, and emission that could potentially reduce costs. It also calls for investing in employee work conditions such as health care and education which may enhance productivity and retention. Unlike philanthropic giving, which is evaluated by its social and environmental return, initiatives in the second theater are predicted to improve the corporate bottom line with social value. [[Bimbo]], the largest bakery in [[Mexico]], is an excellent example of this theater. The company strives to meet social welfare needs. It offers free educational service to help employees complete high school. Bimbo also provides supplementary medical care and financial assistance to close gaps in the government health coverage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moreover, the third theater program aims to transform the business model. Basically, companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges that will lead to financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in [[Unilever|Unilever's]] Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, oils, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is [[IKEA|IKEA's]] People and Planet initiative to be 100% sustainable by 2020. As a consequence, the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reduced scrutiny ===
Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through [[taxation]] or [[regulations]]. A CSR program can persuade governments and the public that a company takes [[health and safety]], diversity and the environment seriously, reducing the likelihood that company practices will be closely monitored.

=== Supplier relations ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Appropriate CSR programs can increase the attractiveness of supplier firms to potential customer corporations. E.g., a fashion merchandiser may find value in an overseas manufacturer that uses CSR to establish a positive image—and to reduce the risks of bad publicity from uncovered misbehavior.

== Criticisms and concerns ==

CSR concerns include its relationship to the purpose of business and the motives for engaging in it.

=== Nature of business ===

[[Milton Friedman]] and others argued that a corporation's purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders and that obeying the laws of the jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior.&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite news

While some CSR supporters claim that companies practicing CSR, especially in developing countries, are less likely to exploit workers and communities, critics claim that CSR itself imposes outside values on local communities with unpredictable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;c.f., Aquino, M.P., Nuestro Clamor por la Vida. Teología Latinoamericana desde la Perspectiva de la Mujer (San José, Costa Rica: Departamento Ecuménico de Investigaciones, 1992), et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Better governmental regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures, are an alternative to CSR that moves decision-making and resource allocation from public to private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganguly | first1 = S | year = 1999 | title = The Investor-State Dispute Mechanism (ISDM) and a Sovereign's power to protect public health | url = | journal = Columbia Journal of Transnational Law | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics claim that effective CSR must be voluntary as mandatory social responsibility programs regulated by the government interferes with people's own plans and preferences, distorts the allocation of resources, and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like Aistiphi Inc have tried to subscribe to the latter view as it relates to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philanthropy.space|title=Philanthropy Space - AISTIPHI {{!}} Development Philanthropy and Community Service|website=philanthropy.space|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aistiphi pioneered the Philanthropy Space™ model that strips down CSR to basic corporate philanthropy. However, rather than leave the entire field to businesses alone, the Philanthropy Space Model situates corporate philanthropy within a larger Commonwealth of Goodwill™ that includes nearly everyone: NGOs, clubs and societies, alumni, professional bodies, international partners, and even students from across the educational spectrum. The Philanthropy Space™ Model oversimplifies CSR, which of course is more than just being philanthropic. However, it creates a public square of goodwill actors that draws broad public attention. By doing so, it enable the public to make judgments about the philanthropic output and motives of businesses. The problem is that the concept assumes that the public is savvy and discerning and that they are able to provide strong evaluative verdicts on a business's CSR based on local understandings and realities.

=== Motives ===

[[File:Story Azim pramji foundation.webm|thumb |A story of CSR promoted by [[:File:Film-Camera.png|Azim Premji Foundation in India]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/playlist/PL172C9F96542248DD]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that the reputational benefits that CSR companies receive (cited above as a benefit to the corporation) demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach.&lt;ref name="McKibben"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers' personal interests at the cost of the shareholders so they are a type of an [[Principal–agent problem|agency problem]] in corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Ing-Haw|last2=Hong|first2=Harrison|last3=Shue|first3=Kelly|title=Do Managers Do Good with Other People's Money? |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 19432 |doi=10.3386/w19432|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Binay K.|date=2016-12-01|title=Causal effect of analyst following on corporate social responsibility |journal=Journal of Corporate Finance|volume=41|pages=201–216|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, it has been argued that there is a "halo effect" in terms of CSR spending. Research has found that firms which had been convicted of bribery in the USA under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) received more lenient fines if they had been seen to be actively engaging in comprehensive CSR practices. It was found that typically either a 20% increase in corporate giving or a commitment to eradicating a significant labour issue, such as child labour, was equated to a 40% lower fine in the case of bribing foreign officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21656218-do-gooding-policies-help-firms-when-they-get-prosecuted-halo-effect|title=The halo effect|journal=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-29|date=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguinis and Glavas conducted a comprehensive review of CSR literature, covering 700 academic sources from numerous fields including [[Organizational behavior|organizational behaviour]], [[strategic management|corporate strategy]], [[marketing]] and [[human resource management|HRM]]. It was found that the primary reason for firms to engage in CSR were the expected financial benefits associated with CSR, rather than being motivated a desire to be responsible to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aguinis|first=Herman|last2=Glavas|first2=Ante|date=2012-07-01|title=What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda|journal=Journal of Management|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=932–968|doi=10.1177/0149206311436079|issn=0149-2063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical ideologies ===
CEOs' political ideologies are evident manifestations of their different personal views. Each CEO may exercise different powers according to their organizational outcomes. In fact, their political ideologies are expected to influence their preferences for the CSR outcomes. Proponents argue that politically liberal CEOs will envision the practice of CSR as beneficial and desirable to increase a firm's reputation. They tend to focus more on how the firm can meet the needs of the society. As a consequence, they will advance with the practice of CSR while adding value to the firm. On the other hand, property rights may be more relevant to conservative CEOs. Since conservatives tend to value free markets, individualism and call for a respect of authority, they will not likely envision this practice as often as those identifying as liberals might.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chin, M.K.; Treviño, Linda; Hambrick, Donald (2013). "Political Ideologies of CEOs: The Influence of Executives' Values on Corporate Social Responsibility" (PDF). ''SAGE Journals''. Johnson Cornell University. 58 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The financials of the company and the practice of CSR also have a positive relationship. Moreover, the performance of a company tends to influence conservatives more likely than liberals. While not seeing it from the financial performance point of view, liberals tend to hold a view that CSR adds to the business triple bottom line. For instance, when the company is performing well, they will most likely promote CSR. If the company is not performing as expected, they will rather tend to emphasize this practice because they will potentially envision it as a way to add value to the business. In contrast, politically conservative CEOs will tend to support the practice of CSR if they hold a view that it will provide a good return to the financials of the company. In other words, this type of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Misdirection ===
There have been unsubstantiated social efforts, ethical claims, and outright [[greenwashing]] by some companies that has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahdi |first1=Khosro S. |last2=Acikdilli |first2=Gaye |title=Marketing Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Marriage of Convenience or Shotgun Wedding? |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=August 2009 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=103–113 |doi=10.1007/s10551-009-0113-1 |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0113-1?LI=true |issn=0167-4544 |language=en |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other, harmful business practices. For example, [[McDonald's Corporation]] positioned its association with [[Ronald McDonald House]] and other children's charities as CSR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Responsibility - U.S. Perspective |url= http://mcdonalds.com/usa/good/report.RowPar.0002.ContentPar.0002.ColumnPar.0001.File.tmp/2006%20U.S.%20CR%20Brochure%20(English).pdf |publisher=McDonald's USA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230235955/http://mcdonalds.com/usa/good/report.RowPar.0002.ContentPar.0002.ColumnPar.0001.File.tmp/2006%20U.S.%20CR%20Brochure%20(English).pdf |dead-url=yes |archivedate=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its meals have been accused of promoting poor eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment p264&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts which may initially appear to be altruistic CSR may have ulterior motives. The funding of scientific research projects has been used as a source of misdirection by firms. [[Stanley B. Prusiner|Prusiner]], who discovered the protein responsible of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|CJD]] and won of the 1997 Nobel prize in Medicine, thanks the tobacco company [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJ Reynolds]] for their crucial support. RJ Reynolds funded the research into CJD. [[Robert N. Proctor|Proctor]] states that "the tobacco industry was the leading funder of research into genetics, viruses, immunology, air pollution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Harford |date=2017-03-09 |url= https://www.ft.com/content/eef2e2f8-0383-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9 |title=The problem with facts |website=Financial Times |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; anything which formed a distraction from the well-established research linking smoking and cancer.

Research has also found that corporate [[social marketing]], a form of CSR promoting societal good, is being used to direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones |first=Sandra C. |last2=Wyatt |first2=Austin |last3=Daube |first3=Mike |date=2016-12-01 |title=Smokescreens and Beer Goggles: How Alcohol Industry CSM Protects the Industry |url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524500415621558 |journal=Social Marketing Quarterly |language=en |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1177/1524500415621558 |issn=1524-5004 |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that adverts which supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a [[Social norms approach|social norm]]. Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in this case to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.

=== Controversial industries ===

Industries such as tobacco, alcohol or munitions firms make products that damage their consumers or the environment. Such firms may engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries. This duality complicates assessments of such firms with respect to CSR.{{sfn |Halpern |Snider |2012 |pages=604–624}}

===The Kizhakkambalam takeover===
[[Textile company]] Kitex has taken over the administration of an entire Indian village called [[Kizhakkambalam]] near Cochin by winning the local body elections. Environmentalists and mainstream politicians of India point out that this can lead to a dangerous precedent because the company got actively involved in CSR only after they were caught red-handed in [[pollution|polluting]] the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ittyipe |first=Minu |title=A Corp’s New Clothes |url= https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-corps-new-clothes/295855 |publisher=Outlook |date=25 November 2015 |location=India |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stakeholder influence ==

One motivation for corporations to adopt CSR is to satisfy stakeholders.

Branco and Rodrigues (2007) describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the set of views of corporate responsibility held by all groups or constituents with a relationship to the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Branco |first=M.C. |author2=Rodrigues, L.L. |title=Positioning stakeholder theory within the debate on corporate social responsibility |journal=Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies |year=2007 |volume=12 |pages=5–15 |url=http://ejbo.jyu.fi/pdf/ejbo_vol12_no1_pages_5-15.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their normative model the company accepts these views as long as they do not hinder the organization. The stakeholder perspective fails to acknowledge the complexity of network interactions that can occur in cross-sector partnerships. It relegates communication to a maintenance function, similar to the exchange perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shumate |first=M |author2=O'Conner, A. |title=The symbiotic sustainability model: Conceptualizing NGO-corporate alliance communication |journal=Journal of Communication |year=2010 |volume=60 |pages=577–609 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01498.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical consumerism ===

The rise in popularity of [[ethical consumerism]] over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus |last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumption decisions and in some cases make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=A.B. |last2=Rubera |first2=G. |last3=Seifert |first3=M. |last4=Bhardwaj |first4=G. |year=2011 |title=Doing Good and Doing Better Despite Negative Information? The Role of Corporate Social Responsibility in Consumer Resistance to Negative Information |journal=Journal of Service Research |volume=14 (February) |pages=60–75 |url=http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/14/1/60.abstract |doi=10.1177/1094670510389164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue with the consumer's relationship with CSR is that it is much more complex than it first appears. In their paper on the consumer and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme looked into a phenomenon that they termed the "CSR-Consumer Paradox".&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-104|[104]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. A survey by Cohn &amp; Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-105|[105]]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, so that when it comes down to their actual purchase behaviour, CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say it does.

One theory put forward for explaining the "CSR-Consumer Paradox" is that of "bystander apathy" or the [[bystander effect]]. This theory stems from the social psychology works of Darley and Latané&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-106|[106]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and states that the likelihood of an individual acting in a given situation is greatly reduced if other bystanders do nothing even if that individual strongly believes in a certain course of action. In terms of explaining the CSR-Consumer Paradox, this theory would suggest an "If they do not care then why should I?" mentality. So even if a consumer is against the use of sweatshops or wants to support green causes, they may continue to make purchases from companies that are socially irresponsible just because other consumers seem apathetic towards the issue.

A second explanation issued by Janssen and Vanhamme is that of [[reciprocal altruism]]. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something if they can get something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.

=== Socially responsible investing ===
{{main|Socially responsible investing}}

Shareholders and investors, through [[socially responsible investing]], are using their capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary. For example, some religious investors in the US have withdrawn investment from companies that violate their religious views, while secular investors divest from companies that they see as imposing religious views on workers or customers.&lt;ref name="responsibility945"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Laughlin |first=Bridget |title=Governing Capital?

=== Public policies ===

Some national governments promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate practices. The heightened role of government in CSR has facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies.&lt;ref name="Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10551-007-9514-1| jstor = 25075478| title = Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe| journal = Journal of Business Ethics| volume = 74| issue = 4| pages = 391–407| year = 2007| last1 = Albareda| first1 = Laura| last2 = Lozano| first2 = Josep M.| last3 = Ysa| first3 = Tamyko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various European governments have pushed companies to develop sustainable corporate practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; CSR critics such as [[Robert Reich]] argued that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility with laws and regulation that describe how to conduct business responsibly.

==== Regulation ====

Fifteen [[European Union]] countries are actively engaged in CSR regulation and public policy development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/corporate-social-responsibility-national-public-policies-european-union-compendium-2014|title=Corporate Social Responsibility National Public Policies in the European Union - Compendium 2014 - Digital Single Market - European Commission|website=Digital Single Market|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSR efforts and policies are different among countries, responding to the complexity and diversity of governmental, corporate and societal roles. Some studies have claimed that the role and effectiveness of these actors were case-specific.&lt;ref name="Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe"/&gt; This variety among company approaches to CSR can complicate regulatory processes.{{sfn |Sacconi |2004}}

Canada adopted CSR in 2007. [[Prime Minister Harper]] encouraged Canadian mining companies to meet Canada's newly developed CSR standards.&lt;ref name="Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada"&gt;{{cite web |last=Government |first=Canada |title=Corporate Social Responsibility Building the Canadian Advantage: A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Strategy for the Canadian International Extractive Sector |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/other-autre/csr-strat-rse.aspx?view=d |work=Government Policy |publisher=Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Heilbronn Declaration' is a voluntary agreement of enterprises and institutions in Germany especially of the Heilbronn-Franconia region signed the 15th of September 2012. The approach of the 'Heilbronn Declaration' targets the decisive factors of success or failure, the achievements of the implementation and best practices regarding CSR. A form of responsible entrepreneurship shall be initiated to meet the requirements of stakeholders' trust in economy.

In opposition to mandated CSR regulation, Researchers Armstrong &amp; Green suggest that all regulation is "harmful", citing regulation as the cause for North Korea's low economic freedom and per capita GDP. They further claim without source that "There is no form of market failure, however egregious, which is not eventually made worse by the political interventions intended to fix it," and conclude "there is no need for further research on regulation in the name of social responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J.

==== Laws ====

In the 1800s, the US government could take away a firm's license if it acted irresponsibly. Corporations were viewed as "creatures of the state" under the law. In 1819, the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Dartmouth College vs. Woodward]] established a corporation as a legal person in specific contexts. This ruling allowed corporations to be protected under the Constitution and prevented states from regulating firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banerjee |journal= Critical Sociology |year=2008 |pages=51–75 |doi=10.1177/0896920507084623 |title=Corporate Social Responsibility: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly |volume=34 |issue=1 |first=S. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently countries included CSR policies in government agendas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 16 December 2008, the Danish parliament adopted a bill making it mandatory for the 1100 largest Danish companies, investors and state-owned companies to include CSR information in their financial reports. The reporting requirements became effective on 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrgov.dk/sw51190.asp Danish Centre for CSR's official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703215633/http://www.csrgov.dk/sw51190.asp |date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The required information included:
* CSR/SRI policies
* How such policies are implemented in practice
* Results and management expectations

CSR/SRI is voluntary in Denmark, but if a company has no policy on this it must state its positioning on CSR in financial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrgov.dk/home/0/2|title=Home - CSRgov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, item S50K of the Income Tax Act of Mauritius mandated that companies registered in Mauritius paid 2% of their annual book profit to contribute to the social and environmental development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Ramtohul/corporate-social-responsibility-in-mauritius|title=Corporate Social Responsibility in Mauritius|author=Yoganand Ramtohul|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Evolution of corporate social responsibility in India|India]] also enacted a mandatory minimum CSR spending law. Under [[Companies Act, 2013]], any company having a net worth of 500 [[crore]] or more or a turnover of 1,000 crore or a net profit of 5 crore must spend 2% of their net profits on CSR activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Implications of Companies Act, 2013 Corporate Social Responsibility |url=http://gtw3.grantthornton.in/assets/Companies_Act-CSR.pdf |publisher=Grant Thornton India LLP |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules came into effect from 1 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flag Off of CSR Rules: India Inc.'s To-Do List for Compliance to Section-135 |url=http://forbesindia.com/blog/the-good-company/the-flag-off-of-csr-rules-india-inc-s-to-do-list-for-compliance-to-section-135/ |accessdate=7 March 2014 |newspaper=Forbes |date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only mandatory CSR law in the world thus far was passed by the Indian parliament in 2013 as Article 135 of the Companies Law.  According to that bill, all firms with net worth above $75 million, turnover over $150 million, or net profit over $750,000 are required to spend at least 2% of their annual profits (averaged over three years). The law requires that all businesses affected establish a CSR committee to oversee the spending. Prior to this law’s passage, CSR laws applied to public sector companies only.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gatewayhouse.in/a-brief-history-of-indian-csr//&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crises and their consequences ===

Crises have encouraged the adoption of CSR. The [[Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies|CERES]] principles were adopted following the 1989 ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' incident.{{sfn |Grace |Cohen |2004}} Other examples include the [[lead paint]] used by toy maker [[Mattel]], which required the recall of millions of toys and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. [[Magellan Metals]] was found responsible for lead contamination killing thousands of birds in Australia. The company ceased business immediately and had to work with independent regulatory bodies to execute a cleanup. [[Odwalla]] experienced a crisis with sales dropping 90% and its stock price dropping 34% due to cases of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]. The company recalled all apple or [[carrot]] juice products and introduced a new process called "flash pasteurization" as well as maintaining lines of communication constantly open with customers.

== Geography ==

Corporations that employ CSR behaviors do not always behave consistently in all parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Alan |author2=Gail Whiteman |title=Exploring the Geography of Corporate Philanthropic Disaster Response: A Study of Fortune Global 500 Firms |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=February 2009 |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=589–603 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/198172266 |accessdate=11 February 2013 |doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9710-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a single behavior may not be considered ethical in all jurisdictions. E.g., some jurisdictions forbid women from driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/26/world/meast/saudi-arabia-women-drivers|title=Saudi Arabia women defy authorities over female driving ban|author=Mohammed Jamjoom and Laura Smith-Spark, CNN|date=26 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others require women to be treated equally in employment decisions.

=== UK retail sector ===

A 2006 study{{sfn |Oppewal |2006}} found that the UK retail sector showed the greatest rate of CSR involvement. Many of the big retail companies in the UK joined the [[Ethical Trading Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/ |title=Ethical trading Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association established to improve working conditions and worker health.

[[Tesco]] (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tescoplc.com/ |accessdate=24 February 2014 |title=Tesco CSR report}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that their 'essentials' are 'Trading responsibility', 'Reducing our Impact on the Environment', 'Being a Great Employer' and 'Supporting Local Communities'. [[J Sainsbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/index.jsp |title=Sainsbury CSR Report |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; employs the headings 'Best for food and health', 'Sourcing with integrity', 'Respect for our environment', 'Making a difference to our community', and 'A great place to work', etc.
The four main issues to which UK retail these companies committed are environment, social welfare, ethical trading and becoming an attractive workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=P. |author2=Wynn, M., Comfort, D. and Hillier, D. |title=Corporate Social Responsibility and UK Retailers |journal=Issues in Social &amp; Environmental Accounting |year=2007 |volume=1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whooley |first=Niamh |title=The corporate responsibility report |year=2003 |volume=1 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martinuzzi et al. described the terms, writing that human responsibility is "the company deals with suppliers who adhere to principles of natural and good breeding and farming of animals, and also maintains fair and positive working conditions and work-place environments for their own employees. Product responsibility means that all products come with a full and complete list of content, that country of origin is stated, that the company will uphold its declarations of intent and assume liability for its products. Environmental responsibility means that a company is perceived to produce environmental-friendly, ecological, and non-harmful products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martinuzzi |first=André |author2=Robert Kudlak |author3=Claus Faber |author4=Adele Wiman |title=CSR Activities and Impacts of the Retail Sector |journal=RIMAS Working Papers |year=2011 |volume=No.4 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones et al.

=== CSR and US corporations updates ===
An article published in Forbes.com last September 2017 mentioned the yearly study of Boston-based reputation management consulting company Reputation Institute (RI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reputationinstitute.com/|title=Home {{!}} Reputation Institute|website=www.reputationinstitute.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which rates the top 10 US corporations in terms of corporate social responsibility.

According to the CSR Journal, the millennial generation worldwide helps propel brands toward social responsibility.

The National Association on the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) through its chief executive officer Derrick Johnson shared the organization’s insights on how American corporations can help in the realization of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naacp.org/|title=NAACP {{!}} Home|website=NAACP|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article from Yahoo News, the NAACP has been engaged in a crusade for racial justice and economic opportunities during the last 109 years.

'''Disorders of consciousness''' are [[medical conditions]] that inhibit [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="chronic"/&gt; Some define disorders of consciousness as any change from complete self-awareness to inhibited or absent self-awareness and arousal. This category generally includes [[minimally conscious state]] and [[persistent vegetative state]], but sometimes also includes the less severe [[locked-in syndrome]] and more severe but rare [[coma|chronic coma]].&lt;ref name="chronic"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}

==Classification==
Patients in such a dramatically altered state of consciousness present unique problems for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. 
Assessment of cognitive functions remaining after a traumatic brain injury is difficult. Voluntary movements may be very small, inconsistent and easily exhausted. Quantification of brain activity differentiates patients who sometimes only differ by a brief and small movement of a finger.

Consciousness is a complex and multifaceted concept, divided into two main components: [[Arousal]] and [[Awareness]].
Arousal is associated with functional [[brainstem]] neuron populations projecting to both [[Thalamus|thalamic]] and [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] neurons.&lt;ref&gt;Steriade M, Jones BG, McCormick D. Thalamus. NewYork Elesevier, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the assessment of reflexes (Using the Glasgow Coma Scale) is important to investigate the functional integrity of the brainstem.
Awareness is thought to be related with functional integrity of the cerebral cortex and its subcortical connections.
The most important point regarding the classification of disorders of consciousness is, that consciousness cannot be measured objectively by any machine, although many scoring systems have been developed for the quantification of consciousness and neuroimaging techniques are important tools for clinical research, extending our understanding of underlying mechanisms involved.&lt;ref&gt;Laureys S, Majerus S, Moonen G. Assessing consciousness in critically ill patients. In: Vincent JL, ed. 2002 Yearbook of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine. Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, 2002: 715-27&lt;/ref&gt; Disorders in consciousness represent immense social and ethical issues because the diagnosis is methodologically complex and needs careful interpretation. Also the ethical framework must be further developed to guide research in these patients.

===Locked-in syndrome===
{{main|Locked-in syndrome}}
In [[locked-in syndrome]] the patient has awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and meaningful behavior (viz., eye-movement), but is isolated due to [[quadriplegia]] and [[pseudobulbar palsy]], resulting from the disruption of corticospinal and corticobulbar pathways. Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. Eye or eyelid movements are the main method of communication.&lt;ref&gt;American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Recommendations for use of uniform nomenclature pertinent to patients with severe alternations of consciousness. Arch Pyhs Med Rehabil 1995; 76;: 205-9&lt;/ref&gt; Total locked-in syndrome is a version of locked-in syndrome where the eyes are paralyzed as well.&lt;ref name= "bauer1979varieties"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00313105 | author =Bauer, G. and Gerstenbrand, F. and Rumpl, E. | title= Varieties of the locked-in syndrome | journal= Journal of Neurology | volume =221 |issue=2 |pages=77–91 |year=1979 |pmid=92545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimally conscious state===
{{main|Minimally conscious state}}
In a [[minimally conscious state]], the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness. The criteria for minimally conscious state, that patients are not in a [[vegetative state]] but are not able to communicate consistently. This means, that patients have to show limited but reproducible signs of awareness of themself or their environment. This could be following of simple commands, intelligible speech or purposeful behavior (including movements or affective behavior in relation to external stimuli, but not reflexive activity).&lt;ref name="Laureys, Steven 2004"&gt;Laureys, Steven, Adrian M. Owen, and Nicholas D. Schiff. "Brain function in coma, vegetative state, and related disorders." The Lancet Neurology 3.9 (2004): 537-546.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further improvement towards full conscious recovery is more likely in this state than in the vegetative state, but still some patients remain in the MCS constantly.&lt;ref&gt;Giacino JT. Disorders of consciousness: differential diagnosis and neuropathologic features. Semin Neurol 1997; 17:105-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistent vegetative state===
{{main|Persistent vegetative state}}
In a [[persistent vegetative state]], the patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness, is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior. The term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse.&lt;ref name="Laureys, Steven 2004"/&gt; The diagnosis of the vegetative state should be questioned when there is any degree of sustained and reproducible visual pursuit or fixation or response to threatening gestures.
This state reflects an intact brainstem and allied structures but severely damaged white and gray matter in both cerebral hemispheres. The preservation of these structures maintains arousal and automatic functions.&lt;ref&gt;Laureys S, Faymonville ME, Goldman S, et al. Impaired cerebral connectivity in vegetative state. In: Gjedde A, Hansen SB, Knudsen GM, Paulson OB, eds. Physiological imaging of the brain with PET. San Diego: Academic Press, 2000: 329-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall metabolism drops in average to 40-50% of the normal range. After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. Here the metabolism drops to 30-40% of the normal range but seems to be a result of trans-synaptic neuronal degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Tommasino C, Grana C, Lucignani G, Torri G, Fazio F. Regional cerebral metabolism of glucose in comatose and vegetative patients. J Neurosurg Anesthesiol 1995; 7: 109-16&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the diagnosis is problematic, the formal absence of any sign of conscious perception or deliberate action is essential.
This diagnosis can be further classified as a permanent vegetative state (PVS) after approximately 1 year of being in a vegetative state after traumatic brain injury&lt;ref&gt;Menon DK, Owen AM, Williams EJ, et al. Cortical processing in persistent vegetative state. Lancet 1998; 352: 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic coma===
{{main|Chronic coma}}
[[chronic coma|Like coma, chronic coma]] results mostly from cortical or white-matter damage after neuronal or axonal injury, or from focal brainstem lesions.Usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 50-70% of the normal range. The patient lacks awareness and arousal. The patient lies with eyes closed and is not aware of self or surroundings. Stimulation cannot produce spontaneous periods of wakefulness and eye-opening, unlike patients in vegetative state. In medicine, a coma (from the Greek κῶμα koma, meaning deep sleep) is a state of unconsciousness, lasting more than six hours in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, sound, lacks a normal sleep-wake cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. Although, according to the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], a person with confusion is considered to be in the mildest coma. But cerebral metabolism has been shown to correlate poorly with the level of consciousness in patients with mild to severe injury within the first month after traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;ref&gt;Bersneider M, Havda DA, Lee SM, et al. Dissociation of cerebral glucose metabolism and level of consciousness during the period of metabolic depression following human traumatic brain injury. J Neurotrauma 200; 17: 389-401&lt;/ref&gt;
A person in a state of coma is described as comatose. In general patients surviving a coma recover gradually within 2–4 weeks. But recovery to full awareness and arousal is not always possible. Some patients do not progress further than vegetative state or minimally conscious state and sometimes this also results in prolonged stages before further recovery to complete consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Plum F, Posner JB. The diagnosis of stupor and coma (3rd edn). Philadelphia: FA Davis, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a coma patient may appear to be awake, they are unable to consciously feel, speak, hear, or move. For a patient to maintain consciousness, two important neurological components must function impeccably. The first is the cerebral cortex which is the gray matter covering the outer layer of the brain. The other is a structure located in the brainstem, called [[reticular activating system]] (RAS or ARAS). Injury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma.

===Brain death===
{{main|Brain death}}
Brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity, and function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life). The main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation. After [[brain death]] the patient lacks any sense of awareness; sleep-wake cycles or behavior, and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep-state or coma. Although visually similar to a comatose state such as persistent vegetative state, the two should not be confused. Criteria for brain death differ from country to country. However, the clinical assessments are the same and require the loss of all brainstem reflexes and the demonstration of continuing [[apnea]] in a persistently comatose patient (&lt; 4 weeks).&lt;ref&gt;Medical Consultants on the Diagnosis of Death. Guidelines for the determination of death: report of the medical consultants on the diagnosis of death to the President's commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. JAMA 1981; 246: 2184-86&lt;/ref&gt; 
Functional imaging using PET or CT scans, typically show a hollow skull phenomenon. This confirms the absence of neuronal function in the whole brain.
Patients classified as brain dead are legally dead and can qualify as organ donors, in which their organs are surgically removed and prepared for a particular recipient.

Brain death is one of the deciding factors when pronouncing a trauma patient as dead. Determining function and presence of necrosis after trauma to the whole brain or brain-stem may be used to determine brain death, and is used in many states in the US.

==Methodological problems==

Metabolic studies are useful, but they are not able identify neural activity within a specific region to specific cognitive processes. Functionality can only be identified at the most general level: Metabolism in cortical and subcortical regions that may contribute to cognitive processes.

At present, there is no established relation between cerebral metabolic rates of glucose or oxygen as measured by PET and patient outcome. The decrease of cerebral metabolism occurs also when patients are treated with anesthetics to the point of unresponsiveness. Lowest value (28% of normal range) have been reported during propofol anesthesia. Also deep sleep represents a phase of decreased metabolism (down to 40% of the normal range)&lt;ref&gt;Maquet P, Degueldre C, Delfiore G, et al. Functional neuroanatomy of human slow wave sleep. J Neurosci 1997; 17 2807-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchsbaum MS, Gillin JC, Wu J, et al. Regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate in human sleep assessed by positron emission tomography. Life Sci 1989; 45: 1349-56&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, quantitative PET studies and the assessment of cerebral metabolic rates depends on many assumptions.
PET for example requires a correction factor, [[Positron emission tomography|the lumped constant]], which is stable in healthy brains. There are reports, that a global decrease of this constant emerges after a traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;Wu HM, Huang SC, Hattori N, et al. Selective metabolic reduction in gray matter acutely following human traumatic brain injury. J Neurotrauma 2004; 21: 149-61&lt;/ref&gt;
But not only the correction factors change due to TBI. 
Another issue is the possibility of anaerobic glycolysis that could occur after TBI. In such a case the glucose levels measured by the PET are not tightly connected to the oxygen consumption of the patient's brain.&lt;ref&gt;Hovda DA, Becker DP, Katayama Y. Secondary injury and acidosis. J Neurotrauma 1992; 9 (suppl 1): S47-60&lt;/ref&gt;
Third point regarding PET scans is the overall measurement per unit volume of brain tissue. The imaging can be affected by the inclusion of metabolically inactive spaces e.g. [[cerebrospinal fluid]]in the case of gross hydrocephalus, which artificially lowers the calculated metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer CC, Zubieta JK, Links JM, et al. MR-based correction of brain PET measurements for heterogeneous gray matter radioactivity distribution. J Cereb Blood Flow Metlab 1996; 16: 650-58&lt;/ref&gt;
Also the issue of radiation exposure must be considered in patients with already severely damaged brains and preclude longitudinal or follow-up studies.

==Ethical issues==

Disorders of consciousness present a variety of ethical concerns.
Most obvious is the lack of consent in any treatment decisions. Patients in PVS or MCS are not able to decide for the possibility of withdrawal of life-support. It is also a general question whether they should receive life-sustaining therapy and, if so, for how long? The problems regarding a patient's consent also account for neuroimaging studies. Without patient's consent, such studies are perceived as unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Fins JJ. Constructing an ethical stereotaxy for severe brain injury: balancing risks, benefits and access. Nat Rev Neurosci 2003; 4: 323-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally only few patients have created advance directives before losing decision-making capacity.
Typically approval must be obtained from family or legal representatives depending on governmental and hospital guidelines. 
But even with the consent of representatives, researchers have been refused grants, ethics committee approval and publication.
&lt;br /&gt;
Social issues arise from the enormous costs that are caused by people with disorders of consciousness. Especially chronic comatose and vegetative patients, when recovery is highly unlikely and treatment in the ICU is considered futile by clinicians.
In addition to the aforementioned problems, the question rises why medical resources were being used not for the broader public good but for patients who seemed to have only little to gain from them.
Still research is everything but sure about the irreversibility of these conditions. Some studies demonstrated that some patients suffering from disorders of consciousness may be aware despite clinical unresponsiveness. These recent findings could have a major impact on ethical and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jox RJ, Bernat JL, Laureys S, Racine E. Disorders of consciousness: responding to request for novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Lancet Neurol. 2012; 11(8): 732-38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">'''Endowment''' (in philosophy) refers to the innate capacities of an individual, group, or institution. An individual's "natural endowment" can be abilities, such as intelligence or strength, given at birth. An individual's "social endowment" can be abilities attributed to the individual's position within a social hierarchy. 

According to [[Stephen R. Covey]], author of [[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]], there are seven human endowments.  They are listed below.

==Primary endowments==

1) Self-awareness or self-knowledge
 
2) Imagination and conscience 
 
3) Volition or will power

==Secondary endowments==

4) An [[abundance mentality]]

5) Courage and consideration

6) Creativity

7) Self-renewal

The '''Energy efficiency in Europe''' study is part of the [[Odyssee project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/ Odyssee International Project].&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to monitor [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] progress and [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]]-reduction for the EU-28 countries and [[Norway]], understand the [[energy demand]] trends for European countries, compare the countries in their relative [energy efficiency performance, as well as to benchmark values, measuring the contribution of innovative energy efficiency and renewables technologies to the Lisbon targets to make Europe more competitive and analyse and evaluate the performance of energy efficiency policies in the different EU Member States and at EU level.

The [[ODYSSEE MURE]] is a program coordinated by [http://www2.ademe.fr/servlet/getDoc?id=11433&amp;m=3&amp;cid=96 ADEME] and supported under the [[Intelligent Energy Europe Programme]] of the [[European Commission]].

Energy efficiency is at the heart of the EU’s Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and of the transition to a [[Resource efficiency|resource efficient]] economy. According to EU Commission the EU needs to act now (2011) to get on track to achieve its target while the EU is on course to achieve only half of the 20% objective. The combined effects of full implementation of the measures will generate financial savings of up to €1000 per household annually; improve Europe’s industrial competitiveness; create up to 2 million jobs; and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 740 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52011DC0109:EN:HTML:NOT Energy Efficiency Plan 2011] European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Energy Efficiency Action Plans ==
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan plans offer an opportunity to compare the national energy efficiency measures in the European countries and review the actual national achievements compared to the targets. The first Energy Efficiency Action Plans NEEAP 2008–2010 were delivered in 2007. The second plans should cover the plans from 2011 forward.

=== NEEAP 2008–2010 ===
The action plan reports state the status in 2000–2005 and give the national policies and measures to energy savings by the national governments by sectors by 2016 and 2020.

The British plan sets a target that all new buildings will be zero-carbon from 2011 in Wales and make all homes in England zero carbon by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/demand/legislation/doc/neeap/uk_en.pdf UK Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2007] Defra Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (www.defra.gov.uk)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|According to the German plan energy efficiency constitutes a key competitive factor, greater security of supply of the exhaustible energy sources and the most effective means, from the point of view of costs, of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The German target by 2020 is energy productivity double compared with 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/demand/legislation/doc/neeap/germany_en.pdf National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EEAP) of the Federal Republic of Germany] Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Technology 27 September 2007 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
The "Energy efficiency in Europe" study gathers representatives, such as energy agencies, from the 28 EU Member States plus Norway and it aims at monitoring energy efficiency trends and policy measures in Europe. The [[Energy Technology Data Exchange#Energy Database|energy databases]] are managed by [[Enerdata]], which updates the Odyssee database twice by year.
Odysse measures the energy efficiency progress by main sector (industry, transport, households) and for the whole economy (all final consumers). MURE is a database on policy measures. This project is part of the activity of the [[EnR Club]].

==Energy efficiency in Europe : highlights and figures by sector==
Energy efficiency in the EU-27 improved by about 13% between 1996 and 2007, corresponding to 160 Mtoe energy savings in 2007.

===Industry===
Energy efficiency improved by about 2.1%/year since 1990. Each branches, except textile contributed to decrease the overall industrial efficiency index. Since 1998, structural changes towards less energy-intensive branches now strengthen the influence of efficiency improvements on actual energy intensity in industry. However the impact of these structural changes is limited : they explain about 13% of the reduction in the industrial intensity since 1998. The situation is meanwhile different in countries: structural changes explain a high share of the reduction in 5 countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Sweden, Ireland)

===Households===
In [[households]], energy efficiency improved by 1.1%/year since 1990. Space heating and large appliances experienced the greatest energy efficiency improvement: since 1990, close to 1.5%/year each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Energy Label|url=https://www.ovenu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/pb13466-eu-energy-label.pdf|website=Ovenu UK|publisher=Europa.EU|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
Energy efficiency improved by 0,8% /year since 1990 .
The specific consumption of cars in liters/100&amp;nbsp;km is regularly decreasing (-0.9%/year since 1990), with a more rapidly improvements for new cars since 1995 (-1.6%/year). However, part of this gain is offset by a shift to larger cars.
For road goods transport, the energy consumption per ton-km has decreased regularly since 1993 because of a better management (increase in ton-km/veh except from 1998 to 2002)

==Energy efficiency indicators: objectives and methodology==
According to [http://www.enerdata.net Enerdata],  energy efficiency indicators can be used to make several types of analysis :

* Monitor the targets set at the national and international levels in energy efficiency and CO2 abatement programmes.
* Evaluate of the energy efficiency policy and programmes. Ministries, energy agencies or organisations in charge of the implementation of energy efficiency programmes need to provide regular evaluations to justify their action and the large amounts of public money that have been spent to support these programmes or to operate the energy efficiency agencies. In January 2013, the [[European Court of Auditors]] declare that reducing the primary energy consumption by 20% will be possible only by strengthening these evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/20590745.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plan future actions, including R&amp;D programmes,
* Feed the energy demand forecasting models and improving the quality of forecasts, technico-economic models, that are characterised by a high level of desegregation (end-uses) make use of energy efficiency indicators to account for future changes in energy efficiency.
* And finally, make cross-country comparisons in a harmonized way.

The energy intensity indicator is the most often used indicator to measure the energy efficiency. It is calculated per unit of [[Gdp|GDP]] for the overall indicator and transports or value added for services and agriculture or private consumption  for households. However, the ODEX index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/registred/definition_odex.pdf Definition of ODEX indicators in ODYSSEE data base]&lt;/ref&gt; represents a better proxy for assessing energy efficiency trends at an  aggregate level (e.g. overall economy, industry, households, transport, services) than the traditional energy intensities, as they are cleaned from structural changes and from other factors not related to energy efficiency (more appliances, more cars...).&lt;ref&gt;World Energy Council :[http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/energy_efficiency_policies_around_the_world_review_and_evaluation/2_energy_efficiency_trends/1181.asp Energy Efficiency Policies around the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ODEX index is used in the ODYSSEE-MURE project to measure the progress of energy efficiency by main sector (industry, transport, households) and for the whole economy (all final consumers).
For each sector, the index is calculated as a weighted average of sub-sectoral indices of energy efficiency progress; sub-sectors being industrial or service sector branches or end-uses for households or transport modes.

The sub-sectoral indices are calculated from variations of unit [[energy consumption]] indicators, measured in physical units and selected so as to provide the best “proxy” of energy efficiency progress, from a policy evaluation viewpoint. The fact that indices are used enables to combine different units for a given sector, for instance for households kWh/appliance, koe/m2, tep/dwelling…

The weight used to get the weighted aggregate is the share of each sub- sector in the total energy consumption of the sub–sectors considered in the calculation.

A value of ODEX equal to 90 means a 10% energy efficiency gain.

An '''evaluability assessment ''' is...

==Description==
An EA is a qualitative investigation employed before a programme is [[Program evaluation|evaluated]]. Evaluability assessments (EAs) go further than merely providing information of whether a programme can be evaluated or not.&lt;ref name="RLF"&gt;Rossi, P., Lipsey, M. W., &amp; Freeman, H. E. (2004). Expressing and assessing program theory. In P. Rossi, M. W. Lipsey, &amp; H. E. Freeman, ''Evaluation. A systematic approach'' (pp. 133-168). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used to describe the objectives, [[Logic model|logic]] and activities of the programme with an aim to investigate its credibility, feasibility, sustainability and acceptability.&lt;ref name="J&amp;S"&gt;Jung, S. M., &amp; Schubert, J. G. (1983). Evaluability assessment: a two-year retrospective. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', ''5''(4), 435-444.&lt;/ref&gt; EAs address the likelihood of the programme achieving its anticipated outcomes, the required changes needed for optimum management, whether an evaluation can improve the programme’s performance and to identify stakeholder interests in the evaluation and how the findings will be used.&lt;ref name="S&amp;W"&gt;Strosberg, M. A., &amp; Wholey, J. S. (1983). Evaluability assessment: from theory to practice in the department of health and human services. ''Public Administration Review'', ''43''(1), 66-71.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jung and Schubert (1983) these specific aspects&lt;ref name="J&amp;S" /&gt; of a programme need to be address by an EA:
*Obtaining perspectives of all involved in the programme e.g. programme staff and stakeholders
*Investigating the programmes objectives the methods to measure whether they were achieved
*Providing information of the how the programme is actually functioning
*Identifying ways to improve the programme
*Relaying important information about the programme

==Procedure==
Evaluability assessors form a workgroup&lt;ref name="S&amp;W" /&gt; which comprises an evaluation representative and a managerial member of the programme. The workgroup investigates official programme records and documentation. In addition, interviews and observations are conducted to understand and describe how the programme is perceived by the programme staff and relevant stakeholders.&lt;ref name="RLF" /&gt; The workgroup is supervised by a policy group who oversees managerial decisions concerning the impending evaluation of the programme.&lt;ref name="S&amp;W" /&gt; Jung and Schubert (1983) provide six areas &lt;ref name="J&amp;S" /&gt; which ought to be addressed in an EA. These include:&lt;ref name="J&amp;S" /&gt;
*Identifying the programme's objectives
*Identifying the intended activities to achieve the programme objectives
*Identifying incongruities between the programme's objectives and its intended activities
*Investigating field operations
*Comparing actual field operations to the programme's intended activities
*Providing management and evaluation options

==Potential limitations==
An effective EA requires that workgroups and policy groups collaboratively engage with programme staff and stakeholders. This could be problematic when there are differences or tensions that arise between programme staff and stakeholders, posing a challenge to the EA.&lt;ref name="J&amp;S" /&gt; 
Thurston, Graham, and Hatfield (2003) state that EAs are beneficial since they facilitate programme revisions. It is often found that after an EA, programmes require some modifications as there could be inconsistencies with the logic model or issues concerning implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, W. E., Graham, J., &amp; Hatfield, J. (2003). Evaluability assessment a catalyst for program change and improvement. ''Evaluation &amp; The Health Professions'', ''26''(2), 206-221.&lt;/ref&gt; A tension may arise when there are positive unintended outcomes that occur when a programme is poorly designed. How do the evaluability assessors, programme staff and stakeholders manage this difficulty? Is it permissible to allow the problematic programme to operate because of the benefits derived from it, or should the programme be put on hold and reformulated resulting in the end of the positive unintended outcomes?.&lt;ref name="RLF" /&gt;

==Conclusion==
EAs are complex and require cooperation from relevant individuals involved in a programme. They are subjective assessments of how credible a programme is. Despite their limitations, EAs are valuable tools to promptly address issues that arise in a programme. If an EA is efficiently conducted on a poorly designed programme, it has the potential to save programme staff and stakeholders time and funding resources that would be otherwise wasted if the programme were to continue operating unaltered.

[[File:Portrait of Piaras Béaslaí 1919.jpg|thumbnail|[[Piaras Béaslaí]] wearing ''An Fáinne''.]]
'''''Fáinne''''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈfaːnʲə|}}, pl. ''Fáinní'' but often "Fáinnes" in English) is the name of a pin badge worn to show fluency in, or a willingness to speak, the [[Irish Language]].

The three modern versions of the pin as relaunched in 2014 by [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] are the Fáinne Óir (gold circle), Fáinne Mór Óir (large gold circle - 9ct) and Fáinne Airgid (silver circle).

In other contexts, ''fáinne'' simply means "ring" or "circle" and is also used to give terms such as: ''fáinne pósta'' ([[wedding ring]]), ''fáinne an lae'' ([[dawn|daybreak]]), ''Tiarna na bhFáinní'' ([[The Lord of The Rings]]), and ''fáinne cluaise'' ([[earring]]).

== An Fáinne Úr ==
An Fáinne Úr (‘úr’ meaning ‘new’) is the modernised rendition of the Fáinne, having been updated in 2014 by Conradh na Gaeilge. There are three versions presently available from &lt;[http://www.cnag.ie/fainne www.cnag.ie/fainne]&gt;, none requiring test or certification:
 
# '''Fáinne Óir'''  (Gold Fáinne) – for fluent speakers; 
# '''Fáinne Mór Óir'''  (literally, "Large Gold Fáinne") – traditional larger, old style solid 9ct Gold (Colour), the style worn by Liam Neeson in his film portrayal of Michael Collins; 
#'''Fáinne Airgid''' (Silver Fáinne) – for speakers with a basic working knowledge of the language.

== An Fáinne == 
(&lt;small&gt;The Original Organisation)&lt;/small&gt;'''

Two [[Irish language]] organisations, ''An Fáinne'' (est. 1916) ("The Ring" or "The Circle" in Irish) and [[The Society of Gaelic Writers]] (est. 1911), were founded by [[Piaras Béaslaí]] (1881–1965).

They were intended to work together to a certain extent, the former promoting the language and awarding those fluent in its speaking with a ''Fáinne Óir'' (Gold Ring) lapel pin, whilst the latter would promote and create a pool of quality literary works in the language.

All the personnel actively involved  in promoting the concept of An Fáinne were associated with Conradh na Gaeilge, and from an early time An Fáinne used the Dublin postal address of 25 Cearnóg Pharnell / Parnell Square, the then HQ of Conradh na Gaeilge, though the organisations were officially separate, at least at first.

The effectiveness of the organisation was acknowledged in the ''[[Dáil Éireann]]'' on 6 August 1920, when [[Richard Mulcahy]], the ''[[Sinn Féin]]'' ''[[Teachta Dála]]'' for [[Dublin Clontarf (UK Parliament constituency)|Clontarf]] suggested that a league on the model of the ''Fáinne'' for the support of Irish manufactures might be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.F.C.192008060065.html Parliamentary Debates Dáil Éireann - Volume 1 - 6 August 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fáinne.jpg|right|thumb|260px|A ''Gaeilgeoir'' (an [[Irish Language|Irish]] speaker) wearing a ''Fáinne'']]
The ''Fáinne'' lapel pins were, at first, a limited success. They appealed mainly to [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] and [[Irish republicanism|Republicans]], for whom the language was generally learnt as adults as a second language. The appeal to people for whom Irish was the native tongue was limited. They spoke Irish, as did everyone from their village, so there was no point whatsoever wearing a pin to prove it, even if they could have afforded one, or for that matter, even known they existed.

In the early 1920s, many people who earned their ''Fáinne'' did so in prison, the majority of these being anti-treaty [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) Volunteers during the [[Irish Civil War]].

== History ==

According to Piaras Béaslaí's own article in the magazine ''Iris An Fháinne'' in 1922, he states that in the winter of 1915 the language movement was at a low ebb due to lack of funds and a large portion of the best Gaels being so involved in the work of the volunteers that they were forgetting about speaking Irish. He says he wrote an article in ''The Leader'' proposing that Gaels establish an association of those who would take a solemn oath to only speak Irish at certain events and to other Gaelgeoirí and that they should wear a clear symbol.

The article got many letters in favour and against, but two men, Tadhg Ó Sganaill and Colm Ó Murchadha, came to him asking him to organise a meeting towards setting up a council. He says that it was they who set the whole thing up. He says that he went to speak to Cú Uladh (Peadar Mac Fhionnlaíoch 1856-1942), then vice president of Conradh na Gaeilge, and he highly praised the idea.

The meeting was organised for some time in the spring of 1916 in Craobh an Chéitinnigh (the Keating Branch). They went to a 'seanchus' prior to their own meeting in the Ard Chraobh (High Branch) and presented their idea to all those present. They were so taken with the idea that they all came with them to their own meeting in Craobh an Chéitinnigh.

Cú Uladh was there before them and at this meeting and they decided they would (1) form the association and (2) name it "An Fáinne" instead of "An Fáinne Gaedhalach", which was proposed by Colm Ó Murchadha, and three officers were elected to conduct the work of the association.

Piaras supposes that Tadhg Ó Sganaill first thought of the Fáinne (ring) as the symbol. It was an inspired idea, he says, because no one had even thought of this symbol when the name was first proposed.

He states at the end of the article that they had only begun the work of the committee when Easter Week arrived and some of the small amount that were involved were snatched away, but he says, the work continued and the world knows how they well they got on since then.

==Recognition==
The consistently high standard required to qualify for the ''Fáinne'' at this time made them quite prestigious, and there are many reports of people being recruited as night-school teachers of Irish-based purely on the fact they wore the pin.

The [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State]], [[W. T. Cosgrave]] acknowledged the ''Fáinne'' on 8 February 1924 as an indicator of Irish Language proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad1924020800007?opendocument ''Seanad Éireann'' - Volume 2 - 8 February 1924]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
The fact that the underlying reason many ''Fáinne'' wearers had studied Irish was political meant that the semi-independence of the [[Irish Free State]], and the later complete independence of the [[Irish Republic]], along with a period of relative peace in the new province of [[Northern Ireland]], meant they had, to some extent, achieved their aim. Twenty years or so later, a ''Fáinne'' would be a very rare sight. Due to lack of demand they were no longer manufactured, and the organisation had fizzled out.

=='An Fáinne Nua'==
''Conradh na Gaeilge'' and other Irish-language bodies attempted a revival, circa 1965, of the ''Fáinne'', which, for a short time at least, became successful:  '''''An Fáinne Nua'''''  (''''''The New Fáinne'''''') was marketed with the slogan  ''Is duitse an Fáinne Nua!'' &amp;ndash; meaning "The New Fáinne is for '''you'''!."

It came in three varieties:
&lt;/small&gt; An Fáinne Nua Óir      (The new Gold ''Fáinne''),
&lt;/small&gt; An Fáinne Nua Airgid  (The new Silver ''Fáinne''),
&lt;/small&gt; An Fáinne Nua Daite   (The new coloured ''Fáinne'').

The Gold ''Fáinne'' was manufactured from 9ct Gold, whilst the other two were sterling silver. The Coloured ''Fáinne'' also had an enamel blue ring separating two concentric silver circles. The prices for the Gold, Silver and Coloured varieties in 1968 were twelve [[shilling]]s and sixpence, four shillings and five shillings respectively.

They were popular in Ireland during the 1960s–1970s, but fell into relative disuse shortly afterwards. Included among reasons commonly given for this were that the change in fashion made it impractical to wear a lapel pin; the resumption of hostilities in Northern Ireland making people either not wanting to show publicly a "love for things Irish" for fear of intimidation; or, for the more radical elements to place "Irishness" second to "freedom".

==Non-''Fáinne'' variations==

===''Cúpla Focal'' brooch===
As ''cúpla focal'' means "a couple of words", one would assume that it was for beginners. This is contradicted by the ''Fáinne'' website, with a statement to the effect it is worn to show support for the language.

===''Béal na nGael''===
The ''Béal na nGael'' (Mouth of the Irish) is a more modern, totally different, pin badge that shows a face with spiked hair and an open mouth.&lt;ref name=Gaeilge&gt;[http://www.asti.ie/pdfs/Astirs/2007/AstirMarch07.pdf "Gaeilge badge gets students talking"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119013154/http://asti.ie/pdfs/Astirs/2007/AstirMarch07.pdf |date=19 November 2007 }}, in ''Association of Secondary Teachers'', Volume 25: Number 2: March/April 2007 ISSN 0790-6560&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by the students of the [[Gaelcholáiste Reachrann]] [[gaelscoil]] and marketed primarily to [[youth]] in the [[Dublin]] Area. "The aim of the badge is to let the world know that the user is both willing and able to speak Irish, and the students say that what they are promoting is 'a practical product to stimulate more peer-to-peer communication through Irish.'"&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/various_features/beal_na_ngael.shtml Béal na nGael]", feature, Broadcast record for BBC Northern Ireland. Retrieved 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
"The badge won't threaten the place of the ''Fáinne'', they say, because their target market is an age group which is not wearing the ''Fáinne'' and which, their market research suggests, is in many cases not even aware that the ''Fáinne'' exists. They hope this target market will latch on to the badge and wear it as an invitation to others to speak to them in Irish."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Hard inheritance''' was a model of [[heredity]] that explicitly excludes any acquired characteristics, such as of [[Lamarckism]]. It is the exact opposite of [[soft inheritance]], coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] to contrast ideas about [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]].

Hard inheritance states that characteristics of an organism's offspring (passed on through [[DNA]]) will not be affected by the actions that the [[parental]] [[organism]] performs during its lifetime. For example: a medieval [[blacksmith]] who uses only his right arm to [[forge]] [[steel]] will not sire a son with a stronger right arm than left because the blacksmith's actions do not alter his genetic code. Inheritance due to usage and non-usage is excluded. Inheritance works as described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis of evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1980). Provine, William B.; Mayr, Ernst. ed. The Evolutionary synthesis: perspectives on the unification of biology. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 1–48. {{ISBN|0-674-27225-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of inherited [[epigenetics|epigenetic variants]] has led to renewed interest in soft inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. J. (May 2006). "Inherited epigenetic variation—revisiting soft inheritance". [[Nature Reviews Genetics]] 7 (5): 395–401. {{doi|10.1038/nrg1834}}. {{PMID|16534512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">{{more footnotes|date=September 2015}}'''Heterogram''' ([[classical compound]]: "[[wikt:hetero-#English|different]]" + "[[wikt:-gram#English|written]]") is a term used mostly in the [[philology|study of ancient texts]] for a special kind of a [[logogram]] consisting of the embedded written representation of a word in a foreign language, which does not have a spoken counterpart in the main (matrix) language of the text. In most cases, the matrix and embedded languages share the same script. While from the perspective of the embedded language the word may be written either phonetically (representing the sounds of the embedded language) or logographically, it is never a phonetic spelling from the point of view of the matrix language of the text, since there is no relationship between the symbols used and the underlying pronunciation of the word in the matrix language.

In English, the written abbreviations ''[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]]'', ''[[wikt:i.e.|i.e.]]'', and ''[[wikt:viz.|viz.]]'' are often read respectively as "for example", "that is", and "namely".  When read this way, the abbreviations for the [[Latin]] words ''exempli gratia'', ''id est'', and ''videlicet'' are being used logographically to indicate unrelated English phrases.  Similarly, the [[ampersand]] ⟨&amp;⟩, originally a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the Latin word ''[[wikt:et#Latin|et]]'', in many European languages stands logographically for the local word for "and" regardless of pronunciation.  This can be contrasted with the older way of abbreviating ''[[et cetera]]''—''[[wikt:&amp;c.|&amp;c.]]''—where ⟨&amp;⟩ is used to represent ''et'' as a full [[loanword]], not a heterogram.

Heterograms are frequent in [[cuneiform script]]s, such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform, which uses [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] heterograms, or the Anatolian cuneiform, which uses both [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Akkadian]] heterograms.&lt;ref&gt;Kudrinski M. and I. Yakubovich. 2016. Sumerograms and Akkadograms in Hittite: Ideograms, Logograms, Allograms, or
Heterograms? ''Altorientalische Forschungen'' 43(1-2): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] scripts derived from the [[Aramaic]] scripts (such as the [[Pahlavi scripts]]), all logograms are heterograms coming from Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/huzwares Huswāreš].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such heterograms are referred to by terms identifying the source language such as "[[Sumerogram]]s" or "[[Aramaeogram]]s".

{{Buddhism}}
'''Humans in Buddhism''' (Sanskrit {{IAST|'''manuṣya'''}}, Pali {{IAST|'''manussa'''}}) are the subjects of an extensive commentarial literature that examines the nature and qualities of a human life from the point of view of humans' ability to achieve [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. In Buddhism, humans  are just one type of [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]], that is a being with a [[mindstream]]. In Sanskrit Manushya means an Animal with a mind. In Sanskrit the word Manusmriti associated with Manushya was used to describe knowledge through memory. The word Muun or Maan means mind. Mind is collection of past experience with an ability of memory or smriti. Mind is considered as a animal with a disease that departs a soul from its universal enlightened infinitesimal behavior to the finite miserable fearful behavior that fluctuates between the state of heaven and hell before it is extinguished back to its infinitesimal behavior. 

In Buddhism, humans have a very special status: only a human can attain enlightenment as a fully enlightened [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].  Enlightenment as an [[arhat]] can be attained from the realms of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|Śuddhāvāsa deities]].  A [[bodhisattva]] can appear in many different types of lives, for instance as an [[Animals in Buddhism|animal]] or as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]].  Buddhas, however, are always human.&lt;ref&gt;JOL 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualities of human life ==
The status of life as a human, at first is seen as very important.  In the hierarchy of [[Buddhist cosmology]] it is low but not entirely at the bottom.  It is not intrinsically marked by extremes of happiness or [[dukkha|suffering]], but all the states of consciousness in the universe, from hellish suffering to divine joy to serene tranquility can be experienced within the human world.

Humans can be seen as highly favored, in that they have an immediate reason to seek out the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and yet also have the means to listen to it and follow it.  Among the lower realms, [[Pretas]] (aka hungry ghosts), and dwellers in the [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Narakas]] (Buddhist hell(s)) are gripped by pain and fear, and can only endure their lot but cannot better themselves. Animals are intellectually unable to understand the Dharma in full.  The way of life of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]] is dominated by violence and antithetical to the teachings of the Dharma. Most of the Brahmas and Devas simply enjoy reaping the fruits of their past [[Karma in Buddhism|actions]] and think that they are immortal and forever to be happy and so they don't try to practice the Dharma.  When their past karmas have all had their result, these devas will fall into lower worlds and suffer again.  The lowest sorts of devas deal with strife, love, and loss just as humans do, but even so they lack the spur of imminent mortality that can lead humans to seek, not merely a better future life, but an escape from [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]] altogether. However, there are stories of beings in these realms deciding to practice and reaching enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Pali Canon (Samyutta Nikaya, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, Kuddaka NIkaya)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JOL:14-15, BOTV:63&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, life in the world of humans is known as "the precious human rebirth".  Born close to the pivot point of happiness and suffering, humans have a unique capacity for moral choices with long-term significance.&lt;ref&gt;JOL:18&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rebirth is said to be extremely rare. The Majjhima Nikaya (129 Balapandita Sutta) compares it to a wooden cattle-yoke floating on the waves of the sea, tossed this way and that by the winds and currents.  The likelihood of a blind turtle, rising from the depths of the ocean to the surface once in a hundred years, putting its head through the hole in the yoke is considered greater than that of a being in the animal realm, hungry ghost realm or hell realm achieving rebirth as a human. This is because, according to the sutta, in these realms there is no Dhamma (Sanskrit Dharma), no practicing what is right, no doing what is wholesome, and no performing of merit. However it is generally implied that if one is already living as a human they will continue to be reborn in the human world based on good works and so they will be one again and again as long as they are moral and good in the ways described in Buddhist rules regardless of whether or not they are Buddhist themselves. The idea is that one must be good and moral because falling below the human realm is dangerous as the odds of one becoming a human again with any great frequency is slim.&lt;ref&gt;Majjhima Nikaya 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Among humans there are also better and worse conditions for attaining enlightenment.  Besides being born as a human, the favorable conditions for obtaining enlightenment are:
* Being born a human at a time when a Buddha has arisen, has taught the Dharma, and has left a [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Saṅgha]] that carries on the teachings; at such times there is a chance to learn the Dharma.
* Being born a human in countries where the Dharma is known.  Buddhist commentaries contrast the "central lands" where Buddhism is known and can be practiced (originally just northern India, but now including a much larger portion of the globe) with "border countries" where Buddhism is unknown or cannot be practiced due to legal or practical impediments, for instance, a lack of qualified teachers. Technically a "central land" is one which possesses any one of the Buddhist {{IAST|saṅghas}} of [[Bhikkhu|{{IAST|bhikṣus}}]], [[Bhikkhuni|{{IAST|bhikṣuṇīs}}]], [[Upasaka|upāsakas or upāsikās]].
* Being born a human who has the physical and intellectual capacity to grasp the basic message of the Dharma.
* Accepting the relationship between good or evil actions and their consequences, believing that good actions will lead to a happier life, a better rebirth or to enlightenment.
* Confidence in the moral teachings conveyed in the [[Vinaya]].
* Avoiding crimes against people and against the Dharma.
* Having sincere compassion for other people.&lt;ref&gt;JOL:15-16, BOTV:59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as it is difficult to obtain birth as a human, it is also difficult to be born at the time when a Buddha's teaching is still available.  Out of the infinite ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]'' (incredibly long periods) in time, most have no Buddhas appearing in them at all.  The present kalpa is called "Fortunate" because it is said that 1,000 Buddhas will appear in it, something that is very unusual.&lt;ref&gt;BOTV:61&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, Buddhist teachers say that one's present condition as a human should be valued very highly, and not allowed to slide by, as the combination of existence as a human and the presence of a Buddha's teaching may not come again for a very long time. Any human, in this view, who finds himself or herself in a position to learn the Dharma, would be remiss if he or she did not take advantage of it.  This view also stands in contrast to those who would claim that, if one is to be reborn multiple times, there is no need to worry about one's actions in this life as they can always be amended in the future; rather, there is no assurance that in a long series of lives one will ever obtain the right circumstances for enlightenment, so it is important to seize the day.

With regard to a fortunate human life, [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]] said: "Instead of feeling so much regret when we lose our money, we should develop regret when we waste our human life." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tharpa.com/us/book-Joyful.Path.of.Good.Fortune-587.html ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune''], by Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]], Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myth of human origins==
According to the [[Aggañña Sutta]] (DN.27), humans originated at the beginning of the current kalpa as deva-like beings reborn from the [[Buddhist cosmology#Ābhāsvara worlds|Ābhāsvara]] deva-realm.  They were then beings shining in their own light, capable of moving through the air without mechanical aid, living for a very long time, and not requiring sustenance.

Over time, they acquired a taste for physical nutriment, and as they consumed it, their bodies became heavier and more like human bodies; they lost their ability to shine, and began to acquire differences in their appearance.  Their length of life decreased, they differentiated into two sexes and became sexually active.  Following this, greed, theft and violence arose among them, and they consequently established social distinctions and government and elected a king to rule them, called [[Mahāsammata]], "the great appointed one". Some of the kings of India in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha´s]] day claimed descent from him.

== Nature of the human realm ==
In the visionary picture of the human realm presented in [[Buddhist cosmology]], humans live on four continents which are, relatively speaking, small islands in a vast ocean that surrounds the axial world-mountain of [[Sumeru]], and fills most of the Earth's surface.  The ocean is in turn surrounded by a circular mountain wall called {{IAST|Cakravāḍa}} ([[Sanskrit]]) or {{IAST|Cakkavāḷa}} ([[Pāli]]) which marks the horizontal limit of the earth. Because of the immenseness of the ocean, the continents cannot be reached from each other by ordinary sailing vessels, although in the past, when the cakravartin kings ruled, communication between the continents was possible by means of the treasure called the '''cakraratna''' (Pāli '''cakkaratana'''), which a cakravartin and his retinue could use to fly through the air between the continents.

The four continents are:

* '''[[Jambudvipa|Jambudvīpa]]''' (Sanskrit) or '''Jambudīpa''' (Pāli) or 南阎浮提洲 (阎浮提 is also translated as 赡部 in Chinese) is located in the south.
* '''Pūrvavideha''' or '''Pubbavideha'''  or 东毗提诃洲 (毗提诃 is also translated as 胜身) is located in the east.
* '''Aparagodānīya''' or '''Aparagoyāna''' or 西瞿陀尼洲 (瞿陀尼 is also translated as 牛货) is located in the west.
* '''Uttarakuru''' or 北俱卢洲 is located in the north.

{{Politics}}

In [[political science]], an '''initiative''' (also known as a '''popular''' or '''citizens' initiative''') is a means by which a [[petition]] signed by a certain minimum number of [[Voter registration|registered voters]] can force a public vote ([[referendum]], sometimes called a plebiscite).

The initiative may take the form of a '''direct initiative''' or an '''indirect initiative'''. In a direct initiative, a measure is put directly to a vote after being submitted by a petition. In an indirect initiative, a measure is first referred to the [[legislature]], and then put to a popular vote only if not enacted by the legislature.

The vote may be on a proposed [[statute]], [[constitutional amendment]], charter amendment or [[local ordinance]], or to simply oblige the [[executive (government)|executive]] or legislature to consider the subject by submitting it to the order of the day. It is a form of [[direct democracy]].

== Canada ==

=== British Columbia ===
The Canadian province of British Columbia has a citizen initiative law known as the Recall and Initiative Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/96398_00 |title=Table of Contents - Recall and Initiative Act |publisher=Bclaws.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original proposal was [[British Columbia recall and initiative referendum, 1991|put to voters in a referendum]] held in October 1991 and was supported by over 83% of voters. It was subsequently put into force by the incoming NDP government. Since it came into force in 1995, several attempts have been made to hold an initiative, but until the fall of 2010, none had succeeded in reaching the first of the thresholds, securing signatures of 10% of registered voters in each riding throughout British Columbia. The first referendum was held under this legislation on September 2011 on the subject of repealing the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]]. Details of its use in BC are available on the Elections BC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/index.php/referenda-recall-initiative/initiative/ |title=Initiative &amp;#124; Elections BC |publisher=Elections.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==

{{main|European Citizens' Initiative}}
The rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe#Parliamentary power and transparency|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE) included a limited indirect initiative right (Article I-46(4)). The proposal of introducing the [[European Citizens' Initiative]] (ECI) was that 1,000,000 citizens, from minimal numbers of different member states, could invite the executive body of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[European Commission]], to consider any proposal "on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Constitution." The precise mechanism had not been agreed upon. Critics underlined the weakness of this right of initiative, which did not ultimately entail any vote or referendum.

A similar scheme under the same name, European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), has been put forward in the now ratified European [[Lisbon Treaty]] (which entered into force on 1 December 2009), enabling a limited indirect initiative right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708193731/http://bookshop.europa.eu/eubookshop/download.action?fileName=NA7809931ENC_002.pdf&amp;eubphfUid=10740063&amp;catalogNbr=NA-78-09-931-EN-C ]&lt;/ref&gt; It follows very similar rules to the ones outlined in the European Constitution, requiring the signatures of 1,000 000 European Nationals. These citizens would thereby obtain the same right to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal as the Council has had since the establishment of the [[European Communities]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cs - čeština |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2009-0389+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 7 May 2009 - Implementation of the citizens' initiative - P6_TA-PROV(2009)0389 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does require that the signatures come from a "significant number" of Member States. It is suggested that this significant number will need to be around a quarter of member states, with at least 1/500 of the citizens in those member states supporting the initiative. With the variety of languages within the European Union, this creates a significant hurdle for people to navigate. The treaty also makes it clear that right of initiative should not be confused with the right to [[petition]], particularly since a petition is directed to Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=49&amp;pageRank=3&amp;language=en |title=Parliament : Petitions |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a citizens' initiative is directed to the Commission; whereas a petition is a method of remonstrance, usually focussing on perceived infringements of European Law, an initiative is a grassroots proposal for new legislation. In 2013 the subjects of ongoing open initiatives of the European Citizens' Initiative are e.g. about "water and sanitation as a human right" (against [[Water privatization]]), "30 km/h - making the streets liveable!" ([[Traffic calming]] in towns), "[[Basic Income#Basic Income Movement in Europe|Unconditional Basic Income]]" (UBI - Exploring a pathway towards emancipatory welfare conditions), or to "End [[Ecocide]] in Europe" (to give the Earth Rights).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/ongoing?lg=en ''Open initiatives''] at the European Citizens' Initiative official register of The European Commission (often translated in EU-languages). Retrieved 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains to be seen if the ECI evolves into a full initiative or remains in its present state of a ''de facto'' petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/ |title=European Citizens' Initiative on the European Commission's web |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Citizens' Initiative on the initiator's web:&lt;br&gt;[http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/ citizens-initiative.eu]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.democracy-international.org/eci.html democracy-international.org/eci.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===

Since March 1, 2012, groups of at least 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[Finland|Finnish]] citizens with [[suffrage]] have had the constitutional right to send a citizens' initiative (Finnish: ''kansalaisaloite'', Swedish: ''medborgarinitiativ'') to the [[Parliament of Finland]].&lt;ref name="finland-citizens-initiative"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/tietoa/briefly-in-english|title=Citizens' initiatives in Finland|publisher=Ministry of Justice of Finland|accessdate=2013-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602052612/https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/tietoa/briefly-in-english|archivedate=2013-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finland-constitution"&gt;Note: the text is an unofficial translation used by the Ministry of Justice of Finland.

=== France ===

A limited, indirect form of local initiative was added to the [[French Constitution]] (article 72-1, ''référendum d'initiative locale'') on 28 March 2003 as part of [[decentralization]] reforms. However, the only power these "local referendum initiatives" confer on citizens is the ability to add propositions to their local assembly's meeting agenda. The decision as to whether to submit citizen propositions to a popular vote (referendum) rests with the local assembly.

=== Germany ===

All German states have the right to initiative.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, there is no constitutional citizens' initiative in Germany at a federal level.

===Ireland===
The [[Constitution of Ireland]], since its [[enactment of the Constitution of Ireland|1937 enactment]], has never made provision for initiatives.&lt;ref name="constconv_5_3_2"/&gt; Since 2012, the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) has a  [[joint committee]] to which the public can submit [[petition]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/public-petition-oireachtas-594866-Sep2012/|title=How does the new public petitions system work?|last=Barry|first=Aoife|date=14 September 2012|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the committee must formally consider them but need not accept them.&lt;ref name="dail2015042100056"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042100056#WRD00800|title=Written Answer No.225: Constitutional Convention Recommendations|date=21 April 2015|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|page=56|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/about/31stdail/psop-committee/jointsub-committeeonpublicpetitions/|title=Joint Committee on Public Petitions|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/public_petitions.html|title=Public petitions|date=10 October 2016|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=19 December 2016|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May–June 2013, when the [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]] considered Dáil electoral reform, members voted 83:16 in favour of allowing "citizens' initiatives" in general,&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §2 Question 9&lt;/ref&gt; 80:19 to allow them specifically for legislation,&lt;ref name="citzconvq10"&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §2 Question 10&lt;/ref&gt; and 78:17 to allow them for [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional amendment]]s.&lt;ref name="citzconvq10"/&gt; In April 2015, the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|Fine Gael–Labour government]] rejected the recommendations on the basis that there is sufficient public involvement in legislation through the petitions committee and the [[pre-legislative scrutiny]] process.&lt;ref name="dail2015042100056"/&gt;

Article 48 of the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] gave a right of initiative: if more than 50,000 voters demanded a change in law, the Oireachtas had two years to enact it, failing which 75,000 voters could petition for a [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922, Schedule 1|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 48 |nopp=Y|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constconv_5_3_2"&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013; §5.3.2 "Background"&lt;/ref&gt; The only attempt to invoke this was organised in 1927 by [[Fianna Fáil]], the largest [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] party, which sought to abolish the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]. By May 1928 Fianna Fáil claimed 96,000 signatures and attempted to have the petition [[Laying before the house|laid before]] the [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil]] (lower house).

===Romania===
According to Article 74 of the Romanian Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=3#t3c1s3sba74|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 74|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, groups of at least 100,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage that reside in at least one quarter of all the counties and with a minimum 5,000 signatures per county have the right to send a Citizens' Initiative which must be considered by the legislative body (Initiatives that address fiscal or international matters are not covered by this right).  If the initiative concerns changing the Constitution, Article 150 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=7#t7c0s0sba150|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 150|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the group must include at least 500,000 Romanian Citizens with suffrage who reside in at least half of all the counties, with a minimum of 20,000 per county. Article 151 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=7#t7c0s0sba151|title=CONSTITUTIA ROMANIEI|pages=Article 151|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also states that any amendments brought to it, must be also approved by means of a National Referendum.

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] a vote initiated by the public is called a [[Referendums in New Zealand#Citizens initiated referendums|citizen initiated referendum]].  These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months.

== Philippines ==
{{main|People's Initiative}}
People's initiative to propose amendments to the constitution is enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution under Article XVII Section 2, which states:

{{quote|Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters therein. No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.}}

This provision is further protected by Republic Act 6735 or ''The Initiative and Referendum Act.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joselito Guianan Chan, Managing Partner, Chan Robles &amp;amp; Associates Law Firm |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno6735.htm |title=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |publisher=Chanrobles.com |date=1989-08-04 |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law defines initiative as:
# A petition to propose amendments to the constitution.
# A petition to propose enactment of national legislation.
# A petition to propose enactment of local resolution or ordinance on regional, provincial, city, municipal, or barangay level.

The law also provides ''indirect initiative'' defining the exercise of people's initiative through a proposition sent to congress or local legislative body for action.

== Switzerland ==
{{Main|Popular initiative (Switzerland)}}

The [[federal popular initiative]] was included in the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] in 1891, permitting a certain number of citizens (currently 100,000 signatures within 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/vi/index.html?lang=de ''Eidgenössische Volksinitiative''], website of "The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation" (German, possible to switch to French or Italien language). Retrieved 2013-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;) to make a request to amend a constitutional article, or even to introduce a new article into the constitution. The right of initiative is also used at the cantonal and communal level in Switzerland (all [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s, all [[Communes of Switzerland|commune]]s where the [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] citizens' participation originates); many cantons allow initiatives to enact regular non-constitutional law, but the federal system does not.

If the necessary number of supporters is reached, the initiative will be put to a [[plebiscite]] about two or three years later; the delay helps prevent short-term political moods from getting into the constitution. The parliament and government will both issue their official opinions on whether they recommend voting for or against the proposed amendment, and these opinions will be published.

The parliament may also pass an alternative amendment suggestion which will also be included on the ballot; in this case, the voters cast two votes, one for whether or not they want an amendment, and one for which one they want, the original one from the initiative or the one introduced in parliament, in case a majority decides for amending.

A citizen-proposed change to the constitution in Switzerland at the national level needs to achieve both a majority of the national popular vote and a majority of the canton-wide vote  to pass. The vast majority of national initiatives introduced since 1891, when the system started, have failed to receive voter support. But the initiatives have proven to be a useful tool to force the government to concentrate on subjects that will otherwise remain hidden from the politic, lowering the distance between the government and the citizens.

==United States ==
{{Main|Initiatives and referendums in the United States}}
{{cn span|In the [[United States]], a popular vote on a measure is referred to as a [[referendum]] only when originating with the [[legislature]]. An initiative may be called a "[[ballot measure]]", "initiative measure", or "proposition".|date=May 2013}}

The United States has no initiative process at the national level, but the initiative is in use at the level of state government in 24 states and the [[Initiatives and referendums in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |title=State by state listing of where initiatives and referendums are used |publisher=Iandrinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211180917/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/statewide_i%26r.htm |archivedate=2016-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also in common use at the local government level.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section I]] of the [[United States Constitution]] [[Vesting Clause|vests]] "all legislative powers herein granted" to the [[United States Congress|Congress of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution, Article I, Section I&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a national initiative procedure would likely require an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the Constitution]], which would under [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] require two-thirds of both houses of Congress or the application of two-thirds of the [[state legislatures]] to propose, and three-fourths of all state legislatures (or conventions in three-fourths of the [[U.S. state|states]]) to ratify. The Constitution itself, pursuant to [[Article VII of the United States Constitution|Article VII]], was ratified by state conventions rather than by a referendum.

Several proposals have been made to institute a national referendum. The [[Ludlow Amendment]], introduced several times to the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Louis Ludlow]], of [[Indiana]], between 1935 and 1940, proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would require a national referendum to [[declare war]] except in the case of invasion or attack. The amendment came closest to overcoming a [[discharge petition]] on January 10, 1938, when it was defeated in the House by a vote of 209 to 188. That was short of the two-thirds vote required for its passage.

Unsuccessful attempts to get initiatives have nevertheless occurred, but since the proposals were bills, not a constitutional amendments, no initiative could probably have lawfully been voted on notwithstanding the bills' passage. The first attempt to get national ballot initiatives occurred in 1907 when House Joint Resolution 44 was introduced by Rep. [[Elmer Fulton]] of [[Oklahoma]]; the proposal was never put to a vote. In 1977, both the Abourezk-Hatfield National Voter Initiative and the Jagt Resolutions never got out of committee. [[Senator Mike Gravel]] was part of that effort.

The modern system of [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] originated in the state of [[South Dakota]], which adopted initiative and referendum in 1898 by a popular vote of 23,816 to 16,483. [[Oregon]] was the second state to adopt and did so in 1902, when the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] adopted it by an overwhelming majority. The "Oregon System," as it was at first known, subsequently spread to many other states, and became one of the signature reforms of the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s-1920s).

==Brazil ==

On Brazil, a popular law initiative requires two conditions to be send to analysis by the national congress: signatures from at least 1% of the people allowed to vote from all the country and at least 0,3% of the people allowed to vote from each of at least 5 of the 27 federal unities (the 26 states plus the federal district). If both conditions are achivied, then the congress is obliged to discus and vote the initiative.

The '''International POPs Elimination Network''' ('''IPEN''') is a global network of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s dedicated to the common aim of eliminating [[persistent organic pollutants]].

IPEN is composed of public interest non-governmental organizations who support a common platform for the global elimination of POPs. The Participating Organizations (POs) of IPEN are those NGOs which have endorsed the POPs Elimination Platform and/or the Stockholm Declaration. Because the network is primarily engaged in facilitating information exchange and in supporting activities of its constituents, and because the purpose of the network does not include developing network-wide-policy statements, strategies, or action plans, a formal decision-making process for the network can be simple, flexible, and largely administrative in nature. (IPEN 2005)

The International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN) is a global network of more than 600 public interest non-governmental organizations working together for the elimination of persistent organic pollutants, on an expedited yet socially equitable basis. This mission includes achieving a world in which all chemicals are produced and used in ways that eliminate significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, and where persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and chemicals of equivalent concern no longer pollute our local and global environments, and no longer contaminate our communities, our food, our bodies, or the bodies of our children and future generations.

{{Contract law}}
An '''invitation to treat''' (or '''invitation to bargain''' in the United States) is a concept within [[contract law]].&lt;ref&gt;It comes from the Latin phrase ''invitatio ad offerendum'' and means "inviting an offer".&lt;/ref&gt; In Andrew Burrows' words, an invitation to treat is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...an expression of willingness to negotiate. A person making an invitation to treat does not intend to be bound as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom the statement is addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, A. (2009). Offer and Acceptance. A Casebook on Contract (2nd ed., pp. 5). Portland, OR, North America: Hart Publishing. (Original work published 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A contract is a legally binding voluntary agreement that is formed when one person makes an offer, and the other accepts it. There may be some preliminary discussion before an offer is formally made. Such pre-contractual '''representations''' are known variously as “invitations to treat”, “requests for information” or “statements of intention”.

True offers may be accepted to form a contract, whereas representations such as invitations to treat may not. However, although an invitation to treat cannot be accepted it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer. For example, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to treat, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms). If, as in the ''Boots'' case (described below) the offer is made by an action without any negotiations—such as presenting goods to a cashier—the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat.

==Case law==
Generally, [[advertisements]] are not offers but invitations to treat, so the person advertising is not compelled to sell. In ''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204, a defendant who was charged with "offering for sale protected birds"—bramblefinch cocks and hens that he had advertised for sale in a newspaper—was ''not'' offering to sell them. Lord Parker CJ said it did not make business sense for advertisements to be offers, as the person making the advertisement may find himself in a situation where he would be contractually obliged to sell more goods than he actually owned.

In certain circumstances called [[unilateral contract]]s, an advertisement can be an offer; as in ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, where it was held that the defendants, who advertised that they would pay £100 to anyone who sniffed a smoke ball in the prescribed manner and yet caught influenza, were contractually obliged to pay £100 to whomever accepted it by performing the required acts.

A display of goods for [[contract of sale|sale]] in a shop window or within a shop is an invitation to treat, as in the ''Boots'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd]]'' [1953] 1 QB 401 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1953/6.html Bailii]&lt;/ref&gt; a leading case concerning supermarkets. The shop owner is thus not obliged to sell the goods, even if signage such as "special offer" accompanies the display. Also, in ''[[Fisher v Bell]]'' [1961] 1 QB 394, the display of a [[flick knife]] for sale in a shop did not contravene legislation which prohibited "offering for sale an offensive weapon". If a shop mistakenly displays an item for sale at a very low price it is not obliged to sell it for that amount.&lt;ref name="BBC News - 08Sep1999 - The Economy  Argos "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/441740.stm|title=Business: The Economy  Argos - an invitation to 'treat' |date=September 8, 1999 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For an offer to be capable of becoming binding on acceptance, the offer must be definite, clear, and objectively intended to be capable of acceptance.

In England, auctions are governed by the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] (as amended). Section 57(2) provides: “A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner. Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid”. S. 57(3) provides further: “An auction sale may be subject to a reserve price”. However, if the auction is held ''"without reserve"'' then the auctioneer is obliged to sell to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;Warlow v Harrison (1859) 1 E &amp; E 309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry v Davies (Heathcote Ball &amp; Co.) [2000] 1 WLR 1962&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicit from ''[[Payne v Cave]]'' (1789),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Payne v Cave]]'' (1789) 3 TR 148&lt;/ref&gt; an early case concerning auctions, that each bid is deemed to expire when others make higher bids; but some auctioneers (such as [[eBay]]) have lawfully amended this presumption so that, should a higher bidder withdraw his bid, they may accept a lower one.

The [[Call for bids|tender]] process is a debated issue. In the case of ''[[Spencer v Harding]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Spencer v Harding]]'' (1870) LR 5 CP 561&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants offered to sell stock by tender, but the court held that there was no promise to sell to the highest bidder, merely an invitation for offers which they could then accept or reject at will. In ''exceptional'' circumstances an invitation for tenders may be an offer, as in ''[[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd|Harvela Investments v Royal Trust of Canada]]'' [1986]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd]]'' [1986] AC 207&lt;/ref&gt; where the court held that because defendants had made clear an intention to accept the highest tender, then the invitation to tender was an offer accepted by the person making the highest tender. The ''Harvela'' case also made it clear that "referential bids"&lt;ref&gt;(eg: “$2,100,000 or $101,000 in excess of any other offer which you may receive, whichever is the higher”, as in the Harvela case)&lt;/ref&gt; are void as being "[[public policy|contrary to public policy]] and [[Unsportsmanlike conduct#Examples|not cricket]]".

A '''leachate''' is any liquid that, in the course of passing through matter, extracts [[soluble]] or [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] solids, or any other component of the material through which it has passed.

Leachate is a widely used term in the [[environmental science]]s where it has the specific meaning of a liquid that has dissolved or entrained environmentally harmful substances that may then enter the environment. It is most commonly used in the context of land-filling of putrescible or industrial waste.

In the narrow environmental context leachate is therefore any liquid material that drains from land or stockpiled material and contains significantly elevated concentrations of undesirable material derived from the material that it has passed through.

==Landfill leachate==
Leachate from a [[landfill]] varies widely in composition depending on the age of the landfill and the type of [[waste]] that it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, J.; Heinke, G. (1996) Environmental Science and Engineering, Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-120650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ayoung/landfill.html DoE Report CWM039A+B/92] Young, A. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; It usually contains both dissolved and suspended material. The generation of leachate is caused principally by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] percolating through waste deposited in a landfill. Once in contact with decomposing solid waste, the percolating water becomes contaminated, and if it then flows out of the waste material it is termed leachate.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State Departmentof Ecology, [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/87013.pdf Solid Waste Landfill Design Manual]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional leachate volume is produced during this decomposition of [[carbon]]aceous material producing a wide range of other materials including [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]] and a complex mixture of [[organic acid]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[alcohol]]s and simple sugars.

The risks of leachate generation can be mitigated by properly designed and engineered landfill sites, such as those that are constructed on geologically impermeable materials or sites that use impermeable liners made of [[geomembrane]]s or engineered [[clay]]. The use of linings is now mandatory within the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and the [[European Union]] except where the waste is deemed inert. In addition, most toxic and difficult materials are now specifically excluded from landfilling. However, despite much stricter statutory controls, leachates from modern sites are often found to contain a range of contaminants stemming from illegal activity or legally discarded household and domestic products.

===Composition of landfill leachate===
When water percolates through waste, it promotes and assists the process of decomposition by [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. These processes in turn release by-products of decomposition and rapidly use up any available oxygen, creating an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] environment. In actively decomposing waste, the temperature rises and the [[pH]] falls rapidly with the result that many metal ions that are relatively insoluble at neutral [[pH]] become dissolved in the developing leachate. The decomposition processes themselves release more water, which adds to the volume of leachate. Leachate also reacts with materials that are not prone to decomposition themselves, such as fire ash, [[cement]]-based building materials and gypsum-based materials changing the chemical composition. In sites with large volumes of building waste, especially those containing [[gypsum]] plaster, the reaction of leachate with the gypsum can generate large volumes of [[hydrogen sulfide]], which may be released in the leachate and may also form a large component of the landfill gas.

In a landfill that receives a mixture of municipal, commercial, and mixed [[industrial waste]] but excludes significant amounts of concentrated chemical waste, landfill leachate may be characterized as a water-based solution of four groups of contaminants: dissolved organic matter (alcohols, acids, aldehydes, short chain sugars etc.), inorganic macro components (common cations and anions including sulfate, chloride, iron, aluminium, zinc and ammonia), heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cu, Hg), and [[xenobiotic]] organic compounds such as [[halogen]]ated organics, ([[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10643380290813462 Present and Long-Term Composition of MSW Landfill Leachate: A Review] "Peter Kjeldsen, Morton A. Barlaz, Alix P. Rooker, Anders Baun, Anna Ledin, and Thomas H. Christensen"&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical appearance of leachate when it emerges from a typical landfill site is a strongly odoured black-, yellow- or orange-coloured cloudy liquid. The smell is acidic and offensive and may be very pervasive because of hydrogen-, nitrogen- and sulfur-rich organic species such as [[mercaptans]].

===Leachate management===
In older landfills and those with no membrane between the waste and the underlying geology, leachate is free to leave the waste and flow directly into the [[groundwater]]. In such cases, high concentrations of leachate are often found in nearby springs and flushes. As leachate first emerges it can be black in colour, anoxic, and possibly [[effervescent]], with dissolved and entrained gases. As it becomes oxygenated it tends to turn brown or yellow because of the presence of iron salts in solution and in suspension. It also quickly develops a bacterial flora often comprising substantial growths of ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]''.

===History of landfill leachate collection===
In the UK, in the late 1960s, central Government policy was to ensure new landfill sites were being chosen with permeable underlying geological strata to avoid the build-up of leachate. This policy was dubbed "dilute and disperse". However, following a number of cases where this policy was seen to be failing, and an exposee in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of serious environmental damage being caused by inappropriate disposal of industrial wastes, both policy and the law were changed. '''The Deposit of Poisonous Wastes Act 1972''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/deposit-of-poisonous-waste-act-1972|title=Deposit of Poisonous Waste Act 1972 (Hansard)|author=|date=|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with '''The 1974 Local Government Act''', made local government responsible for waste disposal and for the enforcement of environmental standards regarding waste disposal. 

Proposed landfill locations also had to be justified not only by geography but also scientifically. Many European countries decided to select landfill sites in groundwater-free clay geological conditions or to require that the site have an engineered lining. In the wake of European advancements, the United States increased its development of leachate retaining and collection systems. This quickly led from lining in principle to the use of multiple lining layers in all landfills (excepting those truly inert).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leachate.co.uk/html/an_introduction.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals of leachate collection systems===
The primary criterion for design of the leachate system is that all leachate be collected and removed from the landfill at a rate sufficient to prevent an unacceptable [[hydraulic head]] occurring at any point over the lining system.

===Components of leachate collection systems===
There are many components to a collection system including pumps, manholes, discharge lines and liquid level monitors. However, there are four main components which govern the overall efficiency of the system. These four elements are liners, filters, pumps and sumps.

====Liners====
Natural and synthetic liners may be utilized as both a collection device and as a means for isolating leachate within the fill to protect the soil and groundwater below. The chief concern is the ability of a liner to maintain integrity and impermeability over the life of the landfill. Subsurface water monitoring, leachate collection, and clay liners are commonly included in the design and construction of a waste landfill. To effectively serve the purpose of containing leachate in a landfill, a liner system must possess a number of physical properties. The liner must have high tensile strength, flexibility, and elongation without failure. It is also important that the liner resist abrasion, puncture, and chemical degradation by leachate. Lastly, the liner must withstand temperature variation and be black (to resist UV light), easily installed, and economical.

There are several types of liners used in leachate control and collection. These types include [[geomembranes]], geosynthetic clay liners, [[geotextiles]], [[geogrids]], [[geonets]], and [[geocomposites]]. Each style of liner has specific uses and abilities. Geomembranes are used to provide a barrier between mobile polluting substances released from wastes and the groundwater. In the closing of landfills, geomembranes are used to provide a low-permeability cover barrier to prevent the intrusion of rain water. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are fabricated by distributing [[sodium bentonite]] in a uniform thickness between woven and non-woven geotextiles. Sodium bentonite has a low permeability, which makes GCLs a suitable alternative to clay liners in a composite liner system. Geotextiles are used as separation between two different types of soils to prevent contamination of the lower layer by the upper layer. Geotextiles also act as a cushion to protect synthetic layers against puncture from underlying and overlaying rocks. Geogrids are structural synthetic materials used in slope veneer stability to create stability for cover soils over synthetic liners or as soil reinforcement in steep slopes. [[Geonets]] are synthetic drainage materials that are often used in lieu of sand and gravel. Radz can take {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} of drainage sand, thus increasing the landfill space for waste. Geocomposites are a combination of synthetic materials that are ordinarily used singly. A common type of geocomposite is a geonet that is heat-bonded to two layers of geotextile, one on each side. The geocomposite serves as a filter and drainage medium.

Geosynthetic clay liners are a type of combination liner. One advantage to using a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) is the ability to order exact amounts of the liner. Ordering precise amounts from the manufacturer prevents surplus and over-spending. Another advantage to GCLs is that the liner can be used in areas without an adequate clay source. On the other hand, GCLs are heavy and cumbersome, and their installation is very labor-intensive. In addition to being arduous and difficult under normal conditions, installation can be cancelled during damp conditions because the bentonite would absorb the moisture, making the job even more burdensome and tedious.

====Leachate drainage system====
The leachate drainage system is responsible for the collection and transport of the leachate collected inside the liner. The pipe dimensions, type, and layout must all be planned with the weight and pressure of waste, and transport vehicles in mind. The pipes are located on the floor of the cell. Above the network lies an enormous amount of weight and pressure. To support this, the pipes can either be flexible or rigid, but the joints to connect the pipes yield better results if the connections are flexible. An alternative to placing the collection system underneath the waste is to position the conduits in trenches or above grade.

The collection pipe network of a leachate collection system drains, collects, and transports leachate through the drainage layer to a collection sump where it is removed for treatment or disposal. The pipes also serve as drains within the drainage layer to minimize the mounding of leachate in the layer. These pipes are designed with cuts that are inclined to 120 degrees, preventing entry of solid particles.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T. H., R. Cossu, and R. Stegmann, eds. Landfilling of waste leachate. London: Elsevier Applied Science, 1992. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filters====
The filter layer is used above the drainage layer in leachate collection. There are two types of filters typically used in engineering practices: granular and geotextile. Granular filters consist of one or more soil layers or multiple layers having a coarser gradation in the direction of the seepage than the soil to be protected.

====Sumps or leachate well====
As liquid enters the landfill cell, it moves down the filter, passes through the pipe network, and rests in the sump. As collection systems are planned, the number, location, and size of the sumps are vital to an efficient operation. When designing sumps, the amount of leachate and liquid expected is the foremost concern. Areas in which rainfall is higher than average typically have larger sumps. A further criterion for sump planning is accounting for the pump capacity. The relationship of pump capacity and sump size is inverse. If the pump capacity is low, the volume of the sump should be larger than average. It is critical for the volume of the sump to be able to store the expected leachate between pumping cycles. This relationship helps maintain a healthy operation. Sump pumps can function with preset phase times. If the flow is not predictable, a predetermined leachate height level can automatically switch the system on. 

Other conditions for sump planning are maintenance and pump [[Drawdown (hydrology)|drawdown]]. Collection pipes typically convey the leachate by gravity to one or more sumps, depending upon the size of the area drained. Leachate collected in the sump is removed by pumping to a vehicle, to a holding facility for subsequent vehicle pickup, or to an on-site treatment facility. Sump dimensions are governed by the amount of leachate to be stored, pump capacity, and minimum pump drawdown. The volume of the sump must be sufficient to hold the maximum amount of leachate anticipated between pump cycles, plus an additional volume equal to the minimum pump drawdown volume. Sump size should also consider dimensional requirements for conducting maintenance and inspection activities. Sump pumps may operate with preset cycling times or, if leachate flow is less predictable, the pump may be automatically switched on when the leachate reaches a predetermined level.

====Membrane and collection for treatment====
More modern landfills in the developed world have some form of membrane separating the waste from the surrounding ground, and in such sites there is often a leachate collection series of pipes laid on the membrane to convey the leachate to a collection or treatment location. An example of a treatment system with only minor membrane use is the [[Nantmel Landfill Site]].

All membranes are porous to a limited extent so that, over time, low volumes of leachate will cross the membrane. The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact on the quality of the receiving groundwater. A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to internal failure as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also wet waste masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in finished ground levels.

===Re-injection into landfill===
One method of leachate management that was more common in uncontained sites was leachate re-circulation, in which leachate was collected and re-injected into the waste mass. This process greatly accelerated decomposition and therefore gas production and had the impact of converting some leachate volume into [[landfill gas]] and reducing the overall volume of leachate for disposal. However, it also tended to increase substantially the concentrations of contaminant materials, making it a more difficult waste to treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leachate Recirculation Practise and Views|url=http://leachate.co.uk/main/leachate-management/leachate-recirculation-practise/|accessdate=2017-08-18|date=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
[[File:Leachate processing tanks.jpg|thumb|Leachate processing / equalization tanks used in leachate treatment before releasing to a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SWANA 2012 Excellence Award Application "Landfill Gas Control" Seneca Landfill, Inc|url=https://swana.org/Portals/0/Awards/2012Noms/Landfill_Gas_Control_silver.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most common method of handling collected leachate is on-site treatment. When treating leachate on-site, the leachate is pumped from the sump into the treatment tanks. The leachate may then be mixed with chemical reagents to modify the pH and to coagulate and settle solids and to reduce the concentration of hazardous matter. Traditional treatment involved a modified form of [[activated sludge]] to substantially reduce the dissolved organic content. Nutrient imbalance can cause difficulties in maintaining an effective biological treatment stage. The treated liquor is rarely of sufficient quality to be released to the environment and may be tankered or piped to a local sewage treatment facility; the decision depends on the age of the landfill and on the limit of water quality that must be achieved after treatment. With high conductivity, leachate is hard to treat with biological treatment or chemical treatment.

Treatment with reverse osmosis is also limited, resulting in low recoveries and fouling of the RO membranes. Reverse osmosis applicability is limited by conductivity, organics, and scaling inorganic elements such as CaSO4, Si, and Ba.

===Removal to sewer system===
In some older landfills, leachate was directed to the [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, but this can cause a number of problems. Toxic metals from leachate passing through the [[sewage treatment]] plant concentrate in the sewage sludge, making it difficult or dangerous to dispose of the sludge without incurring a risk to the environment. In [[Europe]], regulations and controls have improved in recent decades, and toxic wastes are now no longer permitted to be disposed of in the Municipal Solid Waste landfills, and in most developed countries the metals problem has diminished. Paradoxically, however, as sewage treatment plant discharges are being improved throughout Europe and many other countries, the plant operators are finding that leachates are difficult waste streams to treat. This is because leachates contain very high [[ammoniacal nitrogen]] concentrations, are usually very acidic, are often anoxic and, if received in large volumes relative to the incoming sewage flow, lack the [[Phosphorus]] needed to prevent nutrient starvation for the biological communities that perform the sewage treatment processes. The result is that leachates are a difficult-to-treat waste stream. 

However, within ageing [[municipal solid waste]] landfills, this may not be a problem as the pH returns close to neutral after the initial stage of acidogenic leachate decomposition. Many sewer undertakers limit maximum [[ammoniacal nitrogen]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Environmental Science and Technology - Third Edition - Andrew Porteous - {{ISBN|0-471-63470-0}}, pg 25.&lt;/ref&gt; concentration in their sewers to 250&amp;nbsp;mg/l to protect sewer maintenance workers, as the [[World Health Organization|WHO's]] maximum occupational safety limit would be exceeded at above [[pH]] 9 to 10, which is often the highest pH allowed in sewer discharges.

Many older leachate streams also contained a variety of synthetic organic species and their decomposition products, some of which had the potential to be acutely damaging to the environment.

===Environmental impact===
The risks from waste leachate are due to its high organic contaminant concentrations and high concentration of [[ammonia]]. [[Pathogen]]ic [[microorganism]]s that might be present in it are often cited as the most important, but pathogenic organism counts reduce rapidly with time in the landfill, so this only applies to the freshest leachate. Toxic substances may, however, be present in variable concentrations, and their presence is related to the nature of the waste deposited.
  
Most landfills containing organic material will produce [[methane]], some of which dissolves in the leachate. This could, in theory, be released in poorly ventilated areas in the treatment plant. All plants in Europe must now be assessed under the EU ATEX Directive and [[zoning|zoned]] where explosion risks are identified to prevent future accidents. The most important requirement is the prevention of the discharge of dissolved methane from untreated leachate into public sewers, and most sewage treatment authorities limit the permissible discharge concentration of dissolved methane to 0.14&amp;nbsp;mg/l, or 1/10 of the lower explosive limit. This entails methane stripping from the leachate.

The greatest environmental risks occur in the discharges from older sites constructed before modern engineering standards became mandatory and also from sites in the developing world where modern standards have not been applied. There are also substantial risks from illegal sites and ad-hoc sites used by organizations outside the law to dispose of waste materials. Leachate streams running directly into the aquatic environment have both an acute and chronic impact on the environment, which may be very severe and can severely diminish bio-diversity and greatly reduce populations of sensitive species. Where toxic metals and organics are present this can lead to chronic toxin accumulation in both local and far distant populations. Rivers impacted by leachate are often yellow in appearance and often support severe overgrowths of [[sewage fungus]].

The contemporary research in the field of assessment techniques and remedial technology of environmental issues originating from landfill leachate has been reviewed in an article published in Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology journal  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643389.2013.876524, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Soumyadeep_Mukhopadhyay/publication/275523716_Contemporary_Environmental_Issues_of_Landfill_Leachate_Assessment_and_Remedies/links/5559661608ae6943a876c05a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Problems and failures with collection systems===
Leachate collection systems can experience many problems including clogging with mud or silt. [[Bioclogging]] can be exacerbated by the growth of micro-organisms in the conduit. The conditions in leachate collection systems are ideal for micro-organisms to multiply. Chemical reactions in the leachate may also cause clogging through generation of solid residues. The chemical composition of leachate can weaken pipe walls, which may then fail.

== Other types of leachate ==
{{main|Leaching (chemistry)|l1=Leaching (chemical science)}}

Leachate can also be produced from land that was contaminated by chemicals or toxic materials used in industrial activities such as [[factory|factories]], [[mining|mines]] or storage sites. [[Composting]] sites in areas of high rainfall also produce leachate.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}&lt;!--Or is this "Composting sites also produce leachate during times of high rainfall."?--&gt;

Leachate is also associated with stockpiled [[coal]] and with waste materials from metal ore [[mining]] and other rock extraction processes, especially those in which sulfide containing materials are exposed to air producing [[sulfuric acid]], often with elevated metal concentrations.

In the context of civil engineering (more specifically reinforced concrete design), leachate refers to the effluent of pavement wash-off (that may include melting snow and ice with salt) that permeates through the cement paste onto the surface of the steel reinforcement, thereby catalyzing its oxidation and [[Concrete degradation|degradation]]. Leachates can be [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A | last2 = Chandra | first2 = S | last3 = Kumar Gupta | first3 = S | last4 = Chauhan | first4 = LK | last5 = Kumar Rath | first5 = S | date = Feb 2007 | title = Mutagenicity of leachates from industrial solid wastes using Salmonella reverse mutation assay | url = | journal = Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 210–6 | doi=10.1016/j.ecoenv.2006.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonel Moura''' (born December 26, 1948 in Lisbon, Portugal) is a conceptual artist whose work shifted in the late 1990s from photo based work to [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Robotic art]]. Since then he has produced several Painting Robots and the Robotarium, a zoo for robots. RAP (Robotic Action Painter) (2006) is a robot that makes drawings based on [[emergence]] and [[stigmergy]], decides when the work is ready, and signs it, is displayed as a permanent installation at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Leonel Moura and Henrique Garica Pereira, "Man and Robots: Symbiotic Art". Institut d’Art Contemporain, Villeurbanne, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generativeart.com/on/cic/papersGA2007/16.pdf|author=Leonel Moura|date=2007|title=A new kind of art: The robotic action painter|publisher=X Generative Art Conferece, Politecnico di Milano University|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonel Moura, ''Robot Art: A New Kind of Art''.

==Robots==

'''ArtSbot''' (Art [[Swarm]] Robots), 2003, comprise several small autonomous robots, called Mbots, each equipped with color detection sensors, obstacle avoidance sensors, a microcontroller and actuators, for locomotion and pen manipulation. Mbots have two distinct behaviors: the random behavior that initializes the process by activating a pen, based on a small probability (usually 2/256), whenever the color sensors read white; and the positive feed-back behavior that reinforces the color detected by the sensors, activating the corresponding pen (since there are two pens, the color circle is split into two ranges - 'warm' and 'cold'). With this process the collective set of robots generate compositions where from a random background some color clusters emerge.

'''RAP''' (Robotic Action Painter), 2006, work alone but based on the same principles of emergence and stigmergy. Some improvements however produce rather distinct compositions from those of the ArtSbot swarm. Some of the new skills are: to determine the length and shape of each trace, the capacity to decide, in a non-linear mode, the moment to stop and the ability to sign. Additionally RAP works with six color pens and the RGB sensors are disposed in a grid of 3x3 which permits to detect local patterns and not only colors.

'''ISU''', 2006, is very similar to RAP but is able to write letters and build words. In this fashion it makes compositions that resemble some of the [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] works from the 1950s and automatism.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Robotarium X''' is a large-scale steel glass construction lodging forty-five different robots, most powered by photovoltaic energy and fully autonomous.

'''RUR, the birth of the robot'''

In 2010 Leonel Moura creates a new version of the theatre play RUR with robots.&lt;br&gt;
R.U.R., Rossum’s Universal Robots is a classic playwright written by Karel Capek in the 1920s in which the word ROBOT was coined. Men and robots clash resulting in the extermination of mankind and the emergence of robots as a new dominant species. The play was always staged with human actor’s transvestite as robots. Moura’s new version displays, for the first time, real robots interacting on stage with human actors.&lt;br&gt;
RUR, the birth of the robot, debuted in August 2010 at the Itáu Cultural, São Paulo, Brazil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8102">'''Misplaced loyalty''' (or '''mistaken loyalty''', '''misguided loyalty''' or '''misplaced trust''') is [[loyalty]] placed in other persons or [[organisations]] where that loyalty is not acknowledged or [[respect]]ed; is [[Betrayal|betrayed]] or taken advantage of. It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause.

[[Social psychology (sociology)|Social psychology]] provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way "[T]he [[Norm of reciprocity|norm of social commitment]] directs us to [[Pacta sunt servanda|honor our agreements]]. [...] People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse".&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanism|Humanists]] point out that "[M]an inherits the capacity for loyalty, but not the use to which he shall put it [...] may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile, as he may to what is generous and noble".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur James Balfour, ''Theism and Humanism'' (2000) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the family==

Part of the conventional therapeutic wisdom is 'that those of us who were unlucky enough to be raised by bad parents also get to be burdened as adults by their demands...we maintain a sense of misguided loyalty'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/notes/ruthless-compassion-institute/misplaced-loyalty-toward-hurtful-parents/378824067498 Marcia Sirota, "Misguided Loyalty Toward Hurtful Parents"]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rubric - 'Misplaced Loyalty: The [[Codependency]] Factor'&lt;ref&gt;J. Middleton-Moz/L. Dwinnell, ''After the Tears'' (2010) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; - the [[self-help]] movement would strongly challenge such loyalty: 'in either individual therapy or self-help groups, the goal is to seek out and replace our misguided loyalty and attachment to our failed parents with attachment to healthier peers'.&lt;ref&gt;David P Celaric, ''Leaving Home'' (2005) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalysis would highlight the accompanying paradox that 'the child, it should be remembered, always defends the bad parent more ferociously than the good'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox may help account for what have been called 'trauma bonds...the misplaced loyalties found in exploitive cults, incest families, or hostage and kidnapping situations, or codependents who live with alcoholics, compulsive gamblers or sex addicts'.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Carnes, ''The Betrayal Bond'' (1997) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional==

'Institutions develop powerful instruments of defence for their protection and perpetuation...develop misguided loyalty to committee and boards. To criticize forcibly rather than to cover up is to rock the boat'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gittins | first1 = Diana  | author-link= Diana Gittins | contribution = The corridor of power - the 1960s: Russell Barton | editor-last = Gittins | editor-first = Diana | editor-link = Diana Gittins | title = Madness in its place: narratives of Severalls Hospital, 1913-1997 | pages = 83–84 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780415183888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are 'examples where misguided loyalty on the part of a business owner or manager has led to a decline in a business's performance'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Shenkman, ''The Strategic Heart'' (1996) p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, however, institutions are torn by conflicting codes of loyalty. Thus in the police, in-force loyalty, which 'has sometimes caused officers to lie and cheat on behalf of others...is now regarded as misplaced loyalty': in partial palliation, 'it must be understood that this "looking after one's mates" is a critical element of loyalty for those who face combat'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Peters, ''Police under Pressure'' (2007) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==In analytic controversy==

The charge of misplaced loyalty is often used as a weapon in analytic disputes. [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] for example criticised [[Ernest Kris]] for the way 'he accredits this interpretation to "[[ego psychology]]" ''à la'' [[Heinz Hartmann|Hartmann]], whom he believed he was under some obligation to support'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Neville Symington]]'s 'criticism of [[Melanie Klein]] is that...she maintained the concept of the [[Death drive|death instinct]] in order to remain loyal to [[Freud]]'s instinct theory, but it only muddles her otherwise clear formulations'.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==

* 'The [[Sparta]]ns' behaviour at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]]' might be seen as misplaced loyalty, or at least as 'an overriding commitment and loyalty to the good and the absolutely overriding dictates of the state'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cartledge, ''Thermopylae'' (2007) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; - as an instance when 'unreasoning obedience to a noble but narrow ideal received its logical reward'.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been suggested that part of the military problems of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] came from the way the President, [[Jefferson Davis]], 'had a propensity for meddling with commands and a strong but misplaced confidence in lesser men like...[[Braxton Bragg]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Beauregard]]'.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Nye/J. E. Morpurgo, ''A History of the United States'' Vol 2 (Penguin 1955) p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary==

* "When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her, though I know she lies" [[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Shakespeare's ''Sonnet 138'']].&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Ingram/T Redpath eds, ''Shakespeare's Sonnets'' (London 1978) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[C. S. Lewis]] in his wartime novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' had the following exchange: '"There's such a thing as loyalty", said Jane. McPhee...suddenly looked up with a hundred [[covenanter]]s in his eyes. "There is, Ma'am", he said. "As you get older you will learn that it is a virtue too important to be lavished on individual personalities"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''That Hideous Strength'' (London 2005 [1945]) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;
* On his last day in the C.I.D., [[John Rebus]] reflects guiltily that from his ''first'' day in the C.I.D. he had learnt that '"there's only two teams - us and them ... You covered for mates who'd had too many whiskies with lunch...or gone a bit too far on an arrest...prisoners falling downstairs or stumbling into walls...you covered for ''every''body on your team'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Rankin, ''Exit Music'' (London 2007) p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social psychology]], a '''motivated tactician''' is someone who shifts between quick-and-dirty cognitively economical tactics and more thoughtful, thorough strategies when processing information, depending on the type and degree of motivation.{{sfn|Fiske|2004}} Such behavior is a type of [[motivated reasoning]]. The idea has been used to explain why people use [[stereotype|stereotyping]], biases and categorization in some situations, and more analytical thinking in others.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==History==
After much research on categorization, and other cognitive shortcuts, psychologists began to describe human beings as [[cognitive miser]]s; which explains that a need to conserve mental resources causes people to use shortcuts to thinking about stimuli, instead of motivations and urges influencing the way humans think about their world. [[Stereotypes]] and [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]] were used as evidence of the economic nature of human thinking. In recent years, the work of {{harvtxt|Fiske|Neuberg|1990}}, {{harvtxt|Higgins|Molden|2003}}, {{harvtxt|Molden|Higgins|2005}} and others has led to the recognition of the importance of motivational thinking. This is due to contemporary research studying the importance of [[motivation]] in cognitive processes, instead of concentrating on cognition versus motivation.{{sfn|Molden|Higgins|2005}} Current research does not deny that people will be cognitively miserly in certain situations, but it takes into account that thorough analytic thought does occur in other situations.  

Using this perspective, researchers have begun to describe human beings as "motivated tacticians" who are tactical about how much cognitive resources will be used depending on the individual's intent and level of motivation. Based on the complex nature of the world and the occasional need for quick thinking, it would be detrimental for a person to be methodical about everything, while other situations require more focus and attention. Considering human beings as motivated tacticians has become popular because it takes both situations into account. This concept also takes into account, and continues to study, what motivates people to use more or less mental resources when processing information about the world. Research has found that intended outcome, relevancy to the individual, culture, and affect can all influence the way a person processes information.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Goal-oriented motivational thinking==
The most prominent explanation of motivational thinking is that the person's desired outcome motivates him to use more or less cognitive resources while processing a situation or thing.{{sfn|Molden|Higgins|2005}} Researchers have divided preferred outcomes into two broad categories: directional and non-directional outcomes. The preferred outcome provides the motivation for the level of processing involved.

Individuals motivated by directional outcomes have the intention of accomplishing a specific goal. These goals can range from appearing smart, courageous or likeable to affirming positive thoughts and feelings about something or someone to whom they are close or find likable. If someone is motivated by non-directional outcomes, he or she wishes to make the most logical and clear decision. Whether a person is motivated by directional or non-directional outcomes depends on the situation and the person's goals. [[Confirmation bias]] is an example of thought-processing motivated by directional outcomes. The goal is to affirm previously held beliefs, so one will use less thorough thinking in order to reach that goal. A person motivated to get the best education, who researches information on colleges and visit schools is motivated by a non-directional outcome. Evidence for outcome-influenced motivation is illustrated by research on [[self-serving bias]]. According to {{harvtxt|Miller|1976}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Independent of expectancies from prior success or failure, the more personally important a success is in any given situation, the stronger is the tendency to claim responsibility for this success but to deny responsibility for failure."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motivation based on strategy==
Though outcome-based motivation is the most prominent approach to motivated thinking, there is evidence that a person can be motivated by his or her preferred strategy of processing information.{{sfn|Molden|Higgins|2005}} However, rather than being an alternative, this idea is actually a compliment to the outcome-based approach. Proponents of this approach feel that a person prefers a specific method of information-processing because it usually yields the results he or she wishes to receive. This relates back to the intended outcome being the primary motivation. "Strategy of information processing" means whether a person makes a decision using bias, categories, or analytical thinking. Regardless of whether the method is best suited for the situation or more thorough is less important to the person than its likelihood of yielding the intended result. People feel that their preferred strategy just "feels right".  What makes the heuristic or method feel "right" is that the strategy accomplishes the desired goal (i.e. affirming positive beliefs of self-efficacy).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Other motivations and approaches==
There has been limited research on motivated tactical thinking outside of Western countries. One theory experts have mentioned is that a person's culture could play a large role in a person's motivations.{{sfn|Baumeister|1998}} Nations like the [[United States]] are considered to be [[Individualism|individualistic]], while many Asian nations are considered to be [[Collectivism|collectivistic]]. An individualist emphasizes importance on the self and is motivated by individual reward and affirmation, while a collectivist sees the world as being more group- or culture-based. The difference in the two ways of thinking could affect motivation in information processing. For example, instead of being motivated by self-affirmation, a collectivist would be motivated by more group-affirming goals.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Another theory is that emotions can affect the way a person processes information {{harvtxt|Forgas|2000}}. has stated that current mood can determine the information processing as well as thoroughness of thought. He also mentioned that achieving a desired emotion can influence the level to which information is processed.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14410">'''''Nafs''''' ({{lang|ar|نَفْس}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word occurring in the [[Quran]] and means "[[Self (philosophy)|self]]", "[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]",&lt;ref name=Talib&gt;Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), "Mental health in Islamic medical tradition", ''The International Medical Journal'' '''4''' (2), p. 76-79&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]" or "[[soul]]". In the Quran, the word is used in both the individualistic (verse 2:48) and collective sense (verse 4:1), indicating that although humanity is united in possessing the qualities of a ''nafs'' (i.e. "soul" or "consciousness"), they are individually responsible for exercising the agencies of the "free will" that it provides them.
{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Sunni Islam}}{{Alevism|Beliefs}}

Much of the popular literature on ''nafs'', however, is focused on the [[Sufi]] conceptions of the term. According to the [[Sufi philosophy|Sufi philosophies]], the ''nafs'' in its unrefined state is "the ego", which they consider to be the lowest dimension of a person's inward existence — his animal and [[Satan]]ic nature.&lt;ref name="Chittick 1983"&gt;{{cite book

==Quranic concept==
The triliteral root ''nūn fā sīn'' (ن ف س) occurs 298 times in the Quran, in four derived forms:&lt;ref name="The Quranic Arabic Corpus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=nfs|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Quran Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#once as the form V verb ''tanaffasa'' (تَنَفَّسَ)
#once as the form VI verb ''yatanāfasi'' (يَتَنَافَسِ)
#295 times as the noun ''nafs'' (نَفْس)
#once as the form VI active participle ''mutanāfisūn'' (مُتَنَٰفِسُون)

The noun ''nafs'' has important instances in the Quran such as the following: "O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves..."&lt;ref name=Quran.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/5/105|title=Surah Al-Ma'idah - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|publisher=}} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-5/verse-105/ Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 105 )]&lt;/ref&gt; The major theme of the word ''nafs'' as used in the Quran is to instill a sense of individual responsibility through a strong emphasis on the choices made by the individual (as in 5:105), while at the same time reminding humanity of its common origins (verse 4:1).

The Quran affords much importance to the ''nafs'' of an individual, highlighting the agency of free will and intelligence, without which neither responsibility nor accountability can exist. The Quran does not attribute to the ''nafs'' any inherent properties of [[good]] or [[evil]], but instead conveys the idea that it is something which has to be nurtured and self-regulated, so that it can progress into becoming 'good' through its thoughts and actions. The Quranic conception of the ''nafs'' therefore has an extremely modernistic undertone, much like Nietzsche's conception of "Übermensch" or 'Superman', as suggested by [[Muhammad Iqbal]], a prominent Muslim scholar and philosopher, who went as far as to accuse Nietzsche of borrowing the term from Islamic thought. Iqbal stated: "It is probable that Nietzsche borrowed it (Übermensch) from the literature of Islam or of the East and degraded it by his materialism."&lt;ref name="IQBAL ACADEMY PAKISTAN"

==Sufism's conception of nafs==

===Three principal stages===
There are three principal stages of ''nafs'' in Sufistic Wisdom, also mentioned in different verses of the Quran. The Sufis call them "stages" in the process of development, refinement and mastery of the ''nafs''.&lt;ref name=IdriesShah&gt;{{cite book

===The inciting ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-ʾammārah'')===
In its primitive stage the ''nafs'' incites us to commit evil: this is the ''nafs'' as the lower self, the base instincts.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 1975"&gt;{{cite book

Islam emphasizes the importance of fighting the inciting ''nafs'' in Quran&lt;ref name=ahadess.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahadees.com/englisharabicurdu-surah-87.html|title=Surah Al-A'la   -  Arabic Text with Urdu and English Translation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[hadith]]. One [[hadith|tradition]] holds that [[Muhammad]] said after returning from a war, "We now return from the small struggle ([[Jihad#Lesser Jihad .28Jihad bil Saif.29|Jihad Asghar]]) to the big struggle ([[Jihad#Greater Jihad|Jihad Akbar]])". His companions asked, "O [[prophet]] of [[God]], what is the big struggle?" He replied, "The struggle against ''nafs''."&lt;ref name="Kabbani"&gt;{{Cite web

This stage is generally divided into the levels ''al nafs al-hayawaniyya'' und ''al nafs al-iblissiyya''. ''Al nafs al-hayawaniyya'' ("the animal state") describes the self, which runs after material possessesion, sensual desires and animalistic pleasures. ''Al nafs al-iblissiyya'' is even lower than the animal state, because the self seeks to replace God in the love for itself.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman ''The Qur'an: A Philosophical Guide'' Bloomsbury Publishing 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-474-21620-3}} page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran enjoins the faithful "to hinder the ''nafs'' from [[lust]]",{{Quran-usc|79|40}} and another [[hadith|traditional narration]] warns that "the worst enemy you have is [the ''nafs''] between your sides."&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1914"&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rumi]] warns of the ''nafs'' in its guise of religious hypocrisy, saying "the ''nafs'' has a [[rosary]] and a [[Koran]] in its right hand, and a [[scimitar]] and dagger in the sleeve."&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1990"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholson | first = Reynold | authorlink = Reynold Nicholson | title = [[Mathnawi]] of [[Jalaluddin Rumi]] | publisher = [[Gibb Memorial Trust]] | location = Warminster | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-906094-27-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal imagery is often used to describe the ''nafs''. A popular image is a donkey or unruly horse that must be trained and broken so that eventually it will bear its rider to the goal.&lt;ref name="Nicholson 1911"&gt;{{Cite book

===The self-accusing ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-luwwāmah'')===
In Sura al-[[Qiyama]] the Quran mentions "the self-accusing ''nafs''".{{Quran-usc|75|2}} This is the stage where "the [[conscience]] is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one’s ego. One repents and asks for [[forgiveness]]."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"&gt;{{cite book

===The ''nafs'' at peace (''an-nafs al-muṭmaʾinnah'')===
In Sura al-[[Fajr]] the Quran mentions "the ''nafs'' at peace".{{Quran-usc|89|27}} This is the ideal stage of ego for Muslims. On this level one is firm in one’s faith and leaves bad manners behind.&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; The soul becomes tranquil, at peace.&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; At this stage, followers of Sufism have relieved themselves of all [[materialism]] and worldly problems and are satisfied with the will of God.

====Four additional stages of ''nafs''====

In addition to the three principal stages, another four are sometimes cited:

=====The inspired ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-mulhamah'')=====
This stage comes between the 2nd and 3rd principal stages. It is the stage of action. On this level "one becomes more firm in listening to one’s conscience, but is not yet surrendered."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; Once you have seen your weaknesses and have set your targets, this ego inspires you to do good deeds and to be on the plus side. The Sufis say that it is important that whenever you think of good, you must immediately act upon it. Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib lays down three rules:{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}
#Ta'Jeel or Swiftness. A good deed must be done immediately and there should be no laziness.
#Tehqeer or Contempt. You must look at your good acts with contempt otherwise you will become self-righteous.
#Ikhfa or Secrecy. You must keep your good acts secret otherwise people will praise you and it will make you self-righteous.

According to the Quran, charity should be given both secretly and openly. In [[Muhammad Asad]]'s translation of the Quran, 14:31 reads: "[And] tell [those of] My servants who have attained to faith that they should be constant in prayer and spend [in Our way], secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no mutual befriending."

=====The pleased ''nafs'' (''an-nafs ar-raḍīyyah'')=====
The stage comes after the 3rd principal stage. On this level "one is pleased with whatever comes from Allah and doesn’t live in the past or future, but in the moment."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; "One thinks always: ‘Ilahi Anta Maqsudi wa ridhaka matlubi’. One always sees oneself as weak and in need of Allah."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt;

=====The pleasing ''nafs'' (''an-nafs al-marḍīyyah'')=====
On this level the two [[Ruh]]s in man "have made peace".&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; "One is soft and tolerant with people and has good [[Akhlaq]] (Arabic: أخلاق), good manners."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt;

=====The pure ''nafs'' (''an-nafs aṣ-ṣāfīyyah'')=====
On this level "one is dressed in the attributes of the [[insan kamil|Insan Kamil]], the perfected man, who is completely surrendered and inspired by Allah."&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt; One is "in full agreement with the Will of Allah".&lt;ref name="PathToSpiritualExcellence"/&gt;

=====Full sequence of ''nafs'' development=====

Therefore, the full sequence of the seven stages of the development of the ''nafs'' is as follows:

# The inciting ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-ʾammārah)
# The self-accusing ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-luwwāmah)
# The inspired ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-mulhamah)
# The ''nafs'' at peace (an-nafs al-muṭmaʾinnah)
# The pleased ''nafs'' (an-nafs ar-raḍīyyah)
# The pleasing ''nafs'' (an-nafs al-marḍīyyah)
# The pure ''nafs'' (an-nafs aṣ-ṣāfīyyah)

[[Dervish]]es from the [[Jerrahi]] school of Sufism are encouraged to study a text describing these stages of ''nafs'' as a nested series of cities.&lt;ref name="Frager1" /&gt;

====Characteristics of ''nafs''====

In its primitive state the ''nafs'' has seven characteristics that must be overcome:{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}
#[[Pride]] (''Takabbur'')
#[[Greed]] (''Hirs'')
#[[Jealousy]] (''Hasad'')
#[[Lust]] (''Shahwah'')
#[[Backbiting]] (''Gheebah'')
#[[Stinginess]] (''Bokhl'')
#[[wikt:malice|Malice]] (''Keena'')

The '''Natural Capital Initiative''' (NCI) is a partnership of UK organisations which promotes and supports decision-making across government, business and the private sector that results in the sustainable management of our [[natural capital]].&lt;ref name=CEH&gt;{{cite web|title=The Natural Capital Initiative|url=https://www.ceh.ac.uk/natural-capital-initiative|website=www.ceh.ac.uk|publisher=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2009, it is a partnership between two of the UK's learned societies and two of its scientific research institutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/public-policy/natural-capital-initiative/|publisher=British Ecological Society|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
*[[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]
*[[Royal Society of Biology]]
*[[British Ecological Society]]
*[[James Hutton Institute]].

==Aims==
Its stated mission is "to support decision-making that results in the sustainable management of our natural capital based on sound science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/about/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=National Capital Initiative|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide decision-makers from UK government, academia, business, and civil society with a high-level forum for cross-sectoral dialogue on how to realise the UK government's stated objective of embedding [[natural capital]] thinking in policy and practice, and it does this based upon sound evidence from across the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The four main objectives of the Natural Capital Initiative are to:

*Inform the Government's implementation of the [[Ecosystem Approach|ecosystems approach]] - a framework for looking at whole ecosystems in decision-making and valuing the services they provide.
*Identify gaps in science, policy and implementation that inhibit an ecosystems approach.
*Work with government, parliament, agencies, [[NGO]]s, the private sector, scientific bodies and the wider public.
*Inspire the next generation to engage in the sustainable use of the natural environment.

==History==
[[File:Natural Capital graphic.jpg|thumb|[[Natural Capital]] provides us with essential functions and [[ecosystem services]].The NCI supports the UK government and policy-makers in putting natural capital at the heart of economic decision-making.]]
The NCI was established in 2009 in response to the increasing global awareness of the need for more sustainable management of the world's limited natural resources,&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Educating human capital for the preservation of natural capital|url=http://consciouscomms.com/educating-human-capital-for-the-preservation-of-natural-capital/|website=consciouscomms.com|publisher=Conscious Communications|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as highlighted by the 2005 [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Milliennium Ecosystem Assessment|url=http://millenniumassessment.org/en/About.html|website=millenniumassessment.org|publisher=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in April 2009 at a three-day [[symposium]] held in London, entitled ''Valuing our Life Support Systems''. Its conclusions were published in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_full_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report Executive Summary|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_summary_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=Natural Capital Initiative|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DEFRA&gt;{{cite web|title=What nature can do for you|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/396840/pb13897-nature-do-for-you.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=DEFRA|accessdate=7 March 2016|page=23|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the James Hutton Institute announced it was joining the partnership.&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite web|title=James Hutton Institute joins the Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/news/james-hutton-institute-joins-natural-capital-initiative|website=www.hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the NCI held a second major symposium/summit, entitled: ‘Valuing our Life Support Systems’ with the aim of pushing forward the shared natural capital agenda.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The Chair of the NCI (as at 2016) is Professor Alison Hester of the [[James Hutton Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Chair|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/secretariat/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Natural Capital Initiative has been recognised as one of the key groups or organisations in the UK now examining the main issues surrounding the depletion of natural resources and in encouraging the preservation of natural capital.&lt;ref name=Hutton/&gt; 

Its 2009 symposium recommendations are included in the UK government own recommendations and resource documents to senior policy-makers.&lt;ref name=DEFRA/&gt;

In recent years the NCI's support for the development of high-level policy based on sound science, and in line with an ecosystems approach to decision-making, has transferred into reality in a number of ways. In particular, the [[Natural Capital Committee]], supported by [[DEFRA]], evolved out of the UK Government's 2011 'Natural Environment White Paper', as did the 48 [[Local Nature Partnership]]s now established across England which focus on sustainable land management, greening economic growth and human health and wellbeing.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

In 2014 the NCI called on the UK government to introduce a [[natural capital accounting]] element into its [[National accounts|national accounting framework]], and supported the Natural Capital Committee's own proposal for a 25-year Government plan for the UK Natural Environment, which is now under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative urges Government act now to reverse decline in natural capital|url=https://www.rsb.org.uk/news/14-news/1122-natural-capital-initiative-urges-government-to-act-now-to-reverse-decline-in-natural-capital|website=www.rsb.org.uk|publisher=Royal Society of Biology|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government will produce a 25 year plan for the natural environment|url=http://esinternational.com/government-will-produce-a-25-year-plan-for-the-natural-environment/|website=esinternational.com|publisher=ESI|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the NCI published a symposium report, entitled 'Valuing our Life Support Systems', which was launched at a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] event on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing our Life Support Systems Report Launch|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/valuing-our-life-support-systems-report-launch-/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was chaired by [[Barry Gardiner|Barry Gardiner MP]]. The report spelled out the need for a methodology to be established for valuing natural capital. It also raised concerns there was a danger that natural capital could be treated as a commodity unless an ethical framework was in place to ensure the process of natural capital valuation was applied fairly and evenly. It urged that all natural capital concepts needed to be clear, evidence-based and robust, and it welcomed the Government's proposal to extend the life of the Natural Capital Committee until at least the end of that current parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative: Valuing our Life Support Systems Report|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/Valuingourlifesupportsystemssummaryfinal.pdf|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=Houses of Parliament|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|I love this report...I shall steal shamelessly [from it]...I thought the phrase "''The UK is a world leader in environmental science and in writing policy; it is not a world leader in taking subsequent action''" was just gorgeous; it should be written in capital letters over the entrance of [[DEFRA]]!...There has been avoidable failure by government.

'''Naturalistic observation''' is, in contrast to [[analog observation]], a research tool in which a subject is observed in its [[natural habitat]] without any manipulation by the observer.&lt;ref name=KCherry&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |title=What Is Naturalistic Observation? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/naturalistic.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychology 202Q Lab: Naturalistic Observation |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ps202vc/PDF/NaturalisticObservation.pdf |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During naturalistic observation, researchers take great care to avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing by using [[Unobtrusive research|unobtrusive]] methods.&lt;ref name=NatObs&gt;{{cite web |title=Naturalistic Observation |publisher=radford.edu |url=http://www.radford.edu/~tpierce/201%20files/201%20handouts/Naturalistic%20Observationl%20ecture%20notes.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalistic observation involves two main differences that set it apart from other forms of data gathering. In the context of a naturalistic observation, the environment is in no way being manipulated by the observer nor was it created by the observer.&lt;ref name=NatObs/&gt;

[[File:Impala mutualim with birds wide.jpg|left|frameless]]
Naturalistic observation, as a research tool, comes with both advantages and disadvantages that impact its application. By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation is used in many techniques, from watching an animal's eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/RMPA/naturalisticobservation.html|title=Naturalistic Observation|website=peace.saumag.edu|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Netmage'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netmage.it/ Netmage]&lt;/ref&gt; is an international festival dedicated to electronic art curated by Xing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xing.it/ XING]&lt;/ref&gt;  and produced annually—in the city of [[Bologna]]—as a multidisciplinary program of works, investigating and promoting contemporary audiovisual research. The festival was born in 2000 with funds provided by the [[European Union]], when Bologna represented one of the nine major [[European capital of culture]]. The festival concentrates on an amalgam of Happenings, environments, and audio/visual installations, it does through a concentration on creative scenes&lt;ref&gt;[http://arted.osu.edu/publications/pdf_files/paper38.pdf The creative Scene in Milano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704051720/http://arted.osu.edu/publications/pdf_files/paper38.pdf |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subcultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/squealer/butchhome/Ch_Scene/ch_scene_communication.htm CH-Scene: Communication Theories and Musical Communities by Butch Lazorchak]&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of Netmage (eleven editions from 2001 to 2011) was merged into the annual [[Live Arts Week]].

==Mission==
The mission of Netmage is to  investigate the relationship between the  "liveness" and the "ambient space".
At the crossroads of these two terms is situated the notion of "post-cinema": defined as an environmental construction capable of gathering widely diverse attitudes in a public space.
&lt;ref name="popularFilm"&gt;{{cite book |title=Memory and Popular Film: Inside Popular Film|  first="Jeffrey"| last="Pence"  |editor="Paul Grainge"|publisher="Manchester UP"|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Post Cinema/Postmemory It is a cinema made of multi-projections on a number of screens with no seating, a multiplication of narrative traces, possible points of view, physical positions of the spectators; achieving a removal of the forced estrangement of the 20th Century spectator (the darkness of the room, physical and perceptive isolation, a monodirectional viewing perspective) that evoke the world of the first [[Happenings]] of the 1960s, the philosophy of [[expanded cinema]], and successive multimedia installation experiments of the 1980s.

=="Live Media"==

"[[Live Media]] is an open-ended term which has come into currency amongst artists and theoreticians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_topics/v011/11.2saltz.html Live Media: Interactive Technology and Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crca.ucsd.edu/views.php?id=6 Live Media Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Live-media relates to the gathering of relatively diverse practices capable of calling to mind the wide range of research by video producers, visual artists, musicians, sound artists, VJ's, filmmakers, designers and a range of creative people issued by creative scenes and subcultural communities.
Netmage and its curators have been instrumental in coining and promoting this term.

* utilization of electronic, digital or analogue platforms to generate images and sound;
* interaction consisting of visual and audio elements;
* inclusion of liveness (or randomness) as in any kind of performance.

Playing with stimuli, what is created in the live-media experience is a "privilege of variation" that in the first case goes from designer to public, in the second from public to executor. The confrontation is direct, dictated by the logic of the event.

"Dispositif" (post-cinema)&lt;ref name="popularFilm"/&gt; and practice (Live Media) thus represent two types of continuous variation through which Netmage questions possible currents in new media aesthetics, summoning artists and visual operators from diverse disciplines, in a context reminiscent of the [[Happening]].

Despite the complexity born from the exploration of this kind of space, ideal internal space, the  two axes—post-cinema and live media—intertwine and simply state what may be called a gathering, a togetherness of the community of producers, protagonists in the field of contemporary media, who both find themselves isolated; creating then a direct, interdisciplinary confrontation, thus filling a growing gap between hyper-connectivity on one hand, physical and social experience on the other.

==History==
The first edition of the festival was born in an historic watershed with a view on one side from the experiences of one of the last bastions of the Twentieth Century [[avantgarde]], [[video art]], and on the other toward a new front that was as yet undefined while the entire world of research visual production was poised to turn fully digital.

In the field of music, the 1990s had already anticipated a great deal of what was later to come in the visual world, pointing the way to a radical transformation in techniques, languages and methods of cultural consumption. Netmage, different from a number of other festivals dedicated to electronics born in the world of [[nightclub|clubbing]], has concentrated on the production of images, imagination and universal vision.
In eleven editions Netmage has produced and hosted over two hundred projects from over thirty countries (including Europe, Asia, The Americas, Oceania) offering a smattering of the most recent evolutions in the technological imagination and multiple currents.

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}
'''''On Virtue''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ Ἀρετῆς}}; {{lang-la|De Virtute}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Estienne]] (ed.), ''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'', Vol. 3, 1578, [https://archive.org/stream/platonisoperaqua03plat#page/376/mode/2up p. 368].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Socratic dialogue]] attributed to [[Plato]], but which is considered spurious. In the short dialogue, [[Socrates]] discusses with a friend questions about whether virtue can be taught.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;John Madison Cooper, D. S. Hutchinson, (1997), ''Plato, Complete works'', page 1694. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; To answer this question, the author of the dialogue does little more than copy out a few passages from the ''[[Meno]]'' almost word for word.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], (1986), ''A history of Greek philosophy: The later Plato and the Academy'', page 398. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''phi phenomenon''' is the [[optical illusion]] of perceiving a series of still [[Image scanner|images]], when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous [[motion (physics)|motion]]. [[Max Wertheimer]], one of the three founders of [[Gestalt psychology]], defined this phenomenon in 1912.&lt;ref name="Wertheimer 1912"&gt;{{cite journal

|date=April 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phi phenomenon and [[persistence of vision]] together formed the foundation of [[Hugo Münsterberg]]'s theory of [[film]]&lt;ref name="Münsterberg 1916"&gt;{{cite book

The phi phenomenon is similar to [[beta movement]] in that both cause sensation of movement. However, the phi phenomenon is an apparent movement caused by luminous impulses in sequence, whereas beta movement is an apparent movement caused by luminous stationary impulses.&lt;ref name="Steinman 2000"&gt;Steinman, R. M., Z. Pizlo, and  F. J. Pizlo (2000). ''[http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/Magniphi/ Phi is not beta, and why Wertheimer's discovery launched the Gestalt revolution: a minireview]''. Vision Research.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2018}}{{not in citation given|date=May 2018}}

==Persistence of vision==
[[Persistence of vision]], which is popularly taught as the reason for motion illusion, is in reality merely the reason that the black spaces that come between each "real" movie frame are not perceived, which makes the phi phenomenon the true reason for motion illusion in [[film|cinema]] and [[animation]], including the [[phenakistoscope]], [[zoetrope]], and others.

==Experimental demonstration==
The classic phi phenomenon experiment involves a viewer or audience watching a screen, upon which the experimenter projects two images in succession. The first image depicts a line on the left side of the frame. The second image depicts a line on the right side of the frame. The time/lag (the inter-stimulus interval, ISI) between offset of the first and onset of the second line is varied. Once both images have been projected, the experimenter asks the viewer or audience to describe what they saw. This percept changes with the duration of the lag between presentation of the first and second line.

With very little time passing between the two presentations (c. 0–30ms in the original study, Steinman et al. 2000), a viewer will report to perceive the two lines simultaneously. Just before the two lines are no longer perceived simultaneously, the phi phenomenon occurs: Although both lines are perceived to be stationary and simultaneous, motion is perceived between them. This motion is described as having direction (from the earlier presented line to the later presented line) but to not be bound to an object. It was therefore also described as 'pure' motion, that is motion that is not bound to an object. 

This observation lead Wertheimer to suggest that the perception of motion is 'as primary as any other sensory phenomenon' (Boring, 1942; in: Steinman et al. 2000). To explain: Touch can be felt without seeing (hearing, smelling, ...) that one is being touched. In that sense, it is 'primary' in that it does not rely on any other sense to be perceived. Likewise, phi motion is perceived without seeing an object moving, making it similarly 'primary' according to Wertheimer (1912).

If the lag between consecutive presentations is prolonged further, ('beta' / 'optimal') motion is perceived. The line in position A is perceived to move to position B. In the original experiments of Wertheimer (1912), a lag of 60 ms was found to be optimal to obtain this kind of percept. If the lag is further prolonged, two forms of partial movement can be perceived: dual movement and singular movement. In dual movement, two lines are perceived that both move, but not in a continuous way (like from A to B). In singular motion, two lines are perceived of which only one is moving. Finally, from a lag of around 200 ms in the original study onwards, the two lines are perceived to occur in succession—first A, then B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13124">The '''"Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States"''' was a report submitted to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on July 13, 1790, by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the [[First United States Congress]], which met in 1789 when the decimal [[metric system]] had not yet been developed in France, the system of units to be used in the future USA was one point of discussion. Under the Constitution (article I, section 8), the Congress has the constitutional right to decide on a standard of [[weights and measures]]. On January 2, 1790, [[George Washington]] urged Congress to address the need for the uniform system of weights and measures, and on January 15, 1790, the House of Representatives requested Thomas Jefferson to draw up a plan.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linklater|first=Andro|title=Measuring America: How the United States Was Shaped by the Greatest Land Sale in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtTZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=2003|publisher=Plume|isbn=978-0-452-28459-3|pages=103–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decimal [[United States dollar|dollar]] had already been agreed upon in principle in 1785,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc0295)) Journals of the Continental Congress], Wednesday, July 6, 1785&lt;/ref&gt; but would not be implemented until after passage of the [[Coinage Act (1792)|Mint Act]] in 1792. In mid-1790 Jefferson proposed two systems of units. The first was evolutionary, and was based on refinement of the definitions of the units of the existing [[English unit|English system]], as well as simplification of their relationship to each other. The second system was revolutionary, and was based on units linked by powers of ten, very similar to the decimal metric system which would be proposed in France. The base units for length, mass, and volume in Jefferson's revolutionary system (named the foot, the ounce, and the bushel, respectively) were relatively close in size to their pre-existing counterparts and bore identical names, although the manner in which they were defined was very different. 

Jefferson's proposal was the world's first scientifically based, fully integrated, decimal system of weights and measures.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003" /&gt;

==The seconds pendulum basis==
In coordination with scientists in France, Jefferson selected the [[seconds pendulum]] at 45° latitude as the basic reference. For technical reasons, he proposed using a uniform rod as the [[pendulum]] rather than a traditional pendulum.  The pendulum was estimated to be 39.14912 English inches long (in the inches of that time—it wasn't until much later that the inch was defined to be 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm), or 1.5 times that for a vibrating rod (58.72368&amp;nbsp;inches).

==More traditional proposal==
In the evolutionary approach, the foot was to be derived from one of these lengths by a simple integer factor, which would be either three (pendulum) or five (rod), i.e. lengthening it from the traditional value by 1.04970¯6&amp;nbsp;inches to ca. 331.463&amp;nbsp;mm or shortening it by 0.255264&amp;nbsp;inches to ca. 298.317&amp;nbsp;mm. For practical purposes he wanted the rod to be 58¾ (new) inches long, an increase of less than 0.045%.

==Decimal system based on the foot==
Jefferson's proposed decimal system preceded the adoption in France of the decimal metric system, although both developed simultaneously. In France, the metre was to be defined as the ten-millionth part of an arc between the North Pole and the equator. Jefferson's system was based on the length of a rod oscillating seconds at 45 degrees latitude, with the foot defined as one fifth of the length of such a rod. Similar to the French system, Jefferson proposed a system of units linked directly by powers of ten. However, Jefferson's system did not make use of the concept of prefixes, which were of great importance in the French system. Instead, the names of old units were carried over into the new system for decimal multiples of the base units, giving them new values. 

Asserting the value of such thorough reform to the existing system of weights and measures, the report stated:

{{quote|But if it be thought that, either now, or at any future time, the citizens of the United States may be induced to undertake a thorough reformation of their whole system of measures, weights and coins, reducing every branch to the same decimal ratio already established in their coins, and thus bringing the calculation of the principal affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man who can multiply  and divide plain numbers, greater changes will be necessary.}}The following table lists the units of the Jeffersonian decimal system, and their relationship with one another. The values of these units are based on Jefferson's proposal of a foot that was equal in length to one-fifth of a second rod, one quarter-inch shorter than the foot in use at the time, and approximately equal to 0.298461684 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hellman|first=C.

The [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffplan.asp transcript of the original document] gives the value of a kental as 16 stones at one point and 10 stones in another point.  10 was presumably the intended value, given the otherwise consistent decimalization.

==Subsequent developments==
Under the [[United States Constitution]], Article 1 Section 8, Congress shall have power "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures". In his first annual message to Congress (what later came to be called "[[State of the Union Address]]es") on January 8, 1790 (a few months before Jefferson's report to the House of Representatives), [[George Washington]] stated, "Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to."&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29431 George Washington: First Annual Message], accessed October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington repeated similar calls for action in his second&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29432 George Washington: Second Annual Message], accessed October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and third&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29433 George Washington: Third Annual Message], accessed October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; annual messages (after Jefferson's report). Jefferson's decimal proposal had the support of [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and George Washington. [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was a powerful opponent of the proposal.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"/&gt; In late 1791 the Senate appointed a committee to report on the subject and make recommendations. The committee reported in April 1792, unanimously endorsing Jefferson's decimal system. The Senate was slow to act on the matter and while they delayed events in France complicated the issue. Although French scientists working on a decimal system had originally supported using the seconds pendulum as a scientific basis, and Jefferson had deliberately matched his seconds pendulum proposal to the French one, based on a measurement at the latitude of Paris, the French decided to use the length of a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian of the Earth]] instead of a seconds pendulum. This and other developments changed what had promised to be an internationally developed system into a strictly French project. Jefferson wrote, "The element of measure adopted by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] excludes, ''ipso facto'', every nation on earth from a communion of measurement with them."&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"/&gt;

The Senate continued to consider Jefferson's two proposals, along with a number of new proposals, for several years. In 1795 a bill titled "An Act directing certain experiments to be made to ascertain uniform standards of weights and measures for the United States" was passed by the House and was approved by committee in the Senate, but on the last day of the session the Senate said it would consider the bill during the next session. The bill was never taken up again. In 1795 the [[Northwest Indian War]], which for years had prevented the surveying and sale of land in the [[Northwest Territory]] came to an end. A [[land rush]] of settlers, surveyors, squatters, and others rapidly pushed into the region and the federal government had a sudden and intense need to establish a method for surveying and selling land. On May 18, 1796 Congress passed "an Act for the sale of land of the United States in the territory northwest of the River Ohio, and above the mouth of the Kentucky River". This law defined a survey grid system of 6–mile–square [[Survey township|townships]] divided into 1–mile–square [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]], with the defining unit being the [[Chain (unit)|chain]], specifically [[Gunter's chain]]. This was the first unit of measurement designated into law by Congress. This law and the way it defined the survey grid ended debate over Jefferson's decimal system.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9252">In [[mathematics]], an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;  and a ternary mapping &lt;math&gt;T \colon R^3 \to R \,&lt;/math&gt; may be called a '''ternary system'''.  A '''planar ternary ring''' (PTR) or '''ternary field'''  is special type of ternary system used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1943}} to construct [[projective plane]]s by means of coordinates. A planar ternary ring is not a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] in the traditional sense.

There is wide variation in the terminology.  Planar ternary rings or ternary fields as defined here have been called by other names in the literature, and the term "planar ternary ring" can mean a variant of the system defined here. The term "ternary ring" often means a planar ternary ring, but it can also simply mean a ternary system.

==Definition==

A '''planar ternary ring''' is a structure &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a set containing at least two distinct elements, called 0 and 1, and &lt;math&gt;T\colon R^3\to R \,&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping which satisfies these five axioms:
# &lt;math&gt;T(a,0,b)=T(0,a,b)=b,\quad \forall a,b \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;T(1,a,0)=T(a,1,0)=a,\quad \forall a \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d \in R, a\neq c&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique &lt;math&gt;x\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that : &lt;math&gt;T(x,a,b)=T(x,c,d) \,&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c \in R&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique &lt;math&gt;x \in R&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;T(a,b,x)=c \,&lt;/math&gt;; and
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d \in R, a\neq c&lt;/math&gt;, the equations &lt;math&gt;T(a,x,y)=b,T(c,x,y)=d \,&lt;/math&gt; have a unique solution &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R^2&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is finite, the third and fifth axioms are equivalent in the presence of the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|loc=p. 118, Theorem 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No other pair (0', 1') in &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; still satisfies the first two axioms.

==Binary operations==
===Addition===
Define &lt;math&gt;a\oplus b=T(a,1,b)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In the literature there are two versions of this definition. This is the form used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1959|loc=p. 355}}, {{harvtxt|Albert|Sandler|1968|loc=p. 50}}, and {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 128}}, while &lt;math&gt;a \oplus b = T(1,a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is used by {{harvtxt|Hughes|Piper|1973|loc=p. 117}}, {{harvtxt|Pickert|1975|loc=p. 38}}, and {{harvtxt|Stevenson|1972|loc=p. 274}}. The difference comes from the alternative ways these authors coordinatize the plane.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure &lt;math&gt;(R,\oplus)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Loop (algebra)|loop]] with [[identity element]] 0.

===Multiplication===
Define &lt;math&gt;a\otimes b=T(a,b,0)&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;R_{0} = R \setminus \{0\} \,&lt;/math&gt; is closed under this multiplication.  The structure &lt;math&gt;(R_{0},\otimes)&lt;/math&gt; is also a loop, with identity element 1.

===Linear PTR===
A planar ternary ring &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''linear'' if &lt;math&gt;T(a,b,c)=(a\otimes b)\oplus c,\quad \forall a,b,c \in R&lt;/math&gt;.
For example, the planar ternary ring associated to a [[quasifield]] is (by construction) linear.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

==Connection with projective planes==
[[File:Projective_Plane_Coordinates.svg |thumb|400px|Coordinates of a projective plane to establish a planar ternary ring]]

Given a planar ternary ring &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt;, one can construct a [[projective plane]] with point set ''P'' and line set ''L'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Bruck, ''Recent Advances in the Foundations of Euclidean Plane Geometry'', (1955) Appendix I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1943|loc=p.247 Theorem 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Note that &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an extra symbol not in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.)

Let
* &lt;math&gt;P=\{(a,b)|a,b\in R\}\cup \{(a)|a \in R \}\cup \{(\infty)\}&lt;/math&gt;, and 
* &lt;math&gt;L=\{[a,b]|a,b \in R\}\cup\{[a]|a \in R \}\cup \{[\infty]\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then define, &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d \in R&lt;/math&gt;, the [[incidence relation]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in this way:
:&lt;math&gt;((a,b),[c,d])\in I \Longleftrightarrow T(a,c,d)=b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a,b),[c])\in I \Longleftrightarrow a=c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ((a,b),[\infty])\notin I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a), [c,d])\in I \Longleftrightarrow a=c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a), [c])\notin I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a),[\infty])\in I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((\infty),[c,d])\notin I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((\infty),[a])\in I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((\infty),[\infty])\in I&lt;/math&gt;

Every projective plane can be constructed in this way, starting with an appropriate planar ternary ring.  However, two nonisomorphic planar ternary rings can lead to the construction of isomorphic projective planes.

Conversely, given any projective plane π, by choosing four points, labelled ''o'', ''e'', ''u'', and ''v'', no three of which lie on the same line, coordinates can be introduced in π so that these special points are given the coordinates: ''o'' = (0,0), ''e'' = (1,1), ''v'' = (&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) and ''u'' = (0).&lt;ref&gt;This can be done in several ways. A short description of the method used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1943}} can be found in {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ternary operation is now defined on the coordinate symbols (except &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) by ''y'' = T(''x'',''a'',''b'') if and only if the point (''x'',''y'') lies on the line which joins (''a'') with (0,''b''). The axioms defining a projective plane are used to show that this gives a planar ternary ring. 

Linearity of the PTR is equivalent to a geometric condition holding in the associated projective plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related algebraic structures==
PTR's which satisfy additional algebraic conditions are given other names. These names are not uniformly applied in the literature. The following listing of names and properties is taken from {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 129}}.
 
A linear PTR whose additive loop is [[Associative property|associative]] (and thus a [[Group (mathematics)|group ]]), is called a '''cartesian group'''. In a cartesian group, the mappings

&lt;math&gt;x \longrightarrow -x \otimes a + x \otimes b &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;x \longrightarrow a \otimes x - b \otimes x &lt;/math&gt;

must be permutations whenever &lt;math&gt;a \neq b&lt;/math&gt;. Since cartesian groups are groups under addition, we revert to using a simple "+" for the additive operation.

A [[quasifield]] is a cartesian group satisfying the right distributive law:
&lt;math&gt; (x+y) \otimes z = x \otimes z + y \otimes z &lt;/math&gt;.
Addition in any quasifield is [[Commutative property|commutative]].

A [[semifield]] is a quasifield which also satisfies the left distributive law:
&lt;math&gt; x \otimes (y + z) = x \otimes y + x \otimes z.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''planar [[Near-field (mathematics)|nearfield]]''' is a quasifield whose multiplicative loop is associative (and hence a group). Not all nearfields are planar nearfields.

'''PlayStation mentality''' refers to the disassociation between combatants and the consequences of their actions, as a result of the use of weapon interfaces which resemble [[video games]].  The effect is named after the [[PlayStation]] games console, and is commonly cited in discussions of the problems of [[drone strike|drone warfare]], such as that conducted by the [[CIA]] in the [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Pakistan tribal areas]], typically using [[predator drones]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9238">The term '''''post-democracy''''' was coined by [[Warwick University]] [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Colin Crouch]] in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that operate by [[Democracy|democratic system]]s ([[election]]s are held, governments fall, [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small [[elite]] is taking the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch further developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] By Colin Crouch. [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''.

[[File:Colin Crouch - Festival Economia 2013.JPG|thumb|[[Colin Crouch]] introduced the term ''post-democracy'' in 2000.]]The term was used by Crouch to design an evolution within democracies during the 21st century.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; It is a [[polemic]]al term because it calls attention to recognized democracies that are losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The term may also denote a general conception of a post-democratic system that may involve other structures of [[group decision-making]] and [[governance]] than the ones found in contemporary or historical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Joanna|last2=Long|first2=Nicholas J.|last3=Moore|first3=Henrietta L.|title=The State We're In: Reflecting on Democracy's Troubles|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781785332258|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zlSNCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Popescu|first1=Delia|title=Political Action in Václav Havel's Thought: The Responsibility of Resistance|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739149577|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ToGGaQ0dabgC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fonte|first1=John|title=Democracy’s Trojan Horse|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/56-4-Democracys%20Trojan%20Horse.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
By Crouch's definition:&lt;ref name="LSEpd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five minutes with Colin Crouch|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/five-minutes-with-colin-crouch/|website=[[London School of Economics]]|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"A post-democratic society is one that continues to have and to use all the institutions of democracy, but in which they increasingly become a formal shell. The energy and innovative drive pass away from the democratic arena and into small circles of a politico-economic elite."}}

Crouch states that we are not "living in a post-democratic society, but that we were moving towards such a condition".&lt;ref name="LSEpd"/&gt;

== Causes ==
Crouch names the following reasons:
* '''No common goals:''' For people in the [[post-industrial society]] it is increasingly difficult, in particular for the [[underclass]], to identify themselves as a group and therefore difficult to focus on [[Political party|political parties]] that represent them. For instance [[laborer]]s, [[farmer]]s or [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] no longer feel attracted to one political movement and this means that there is no common goal for them as a group to get united.
* '''[[Globalization]]:''' The effect of globalization makes it almost impossible for nations to work out their own economic policy. Therefore, large [[trade agreement]]s and [[supranational union]]s (e.g., the [[European Union]]) are used to make policy but this level of politics is very hard to control with democratic instruments. Globalization additionally endows [[Multinational_corporation|transnational corporations]] with more political leverage given their ability to avoid federal regulation and directly affect domestic economies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Post-Democracy|last = Crouch|first = |publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Non-balanced debates:''' In most democratic countries the positions of the political parties have become very much alike. This means that there is not much to choose from for its voters. The effect is that [[political campaign]]s are looking more like [[advertising]] to make the differences look bigger. Also the private lives of the politicians have become an important item in elections. Sometimes "sensitive" issues stay undiscussed. The English conservative journalist [[Peter Oborne]] presented a documentary of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], arguing that it had become [[Aristocracy (government)|anti-democratic]] because it targeted a number of [[floating voters]] with a narrow agenda.
* '''Entanglement between public and private sector:''' There are large shared interests between politics and business. Through [[lobbying]] companies, [[multinational corporations]] are able to bring about [[legislation]] more effectively than the inhabitants of a country. Corporations and governments are in close relation because states need corporations as they are great employers. But as much of the production is [[outsourcing|outsourced]], and corporations have almost no difficulty in moving to other countries, labor law becomes employee-unfriendly and tax bites are moved from companies to individuals. It becomes more common for politicians and managers to switch jobs (the 'revolving door').
* '''[[Privatization]]:''' Then there is the neoliberal idea of [[new public management]] ([[neoliberalism]]) of privatizing public services. Privatized institutions are difficult to control by democratic means and have no allegiance to human communities, unlike government. Crouch uses the term “phantom firms” to describe the flexibility and elusive nature of firms which bend to the market. He concludes that private firms have incentive to make individual profit rather than better the welfare of the public. For example, he states that there is a problem with pharmaceutical companies funding (and skewing) medical research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
As a consequence:
* Fewer voters use their right to vote, or do vote but don't expect much.
* Politicians can ignore an undesirable outcome of a [[referendum]] or [[opinion poll]]. For instance in 2005 when [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] voted ''No'' at a referendum about the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] these countries still ratified the treaty after only minor modifications were made.
* The rise of [[xenophobic]] and other [[populist]] parties who capitalise on prevailing discontent. 
* Foreign governments can influence the internal politics of a sovereign country. According to Crouch, the way the [[eurozone crisis]] was handled is the best example of how things work in a post-democracy. European leaders managed to bring about a new government taking office in [[Italy]], and in [[Greece]] far-reaching [[austerity]] measures were put in place, contrary to the vote in a popular referendum.
* Private interest becomes increasingly influential in public policy.

== Solutions ==
{{See also|Online participation|LiquidFeedback|Collective problem solving}}
According to Crouch there is an important task for [[social media]] in which voters can participate more actively in [[public debate]]s. In addition, these voters would have to join [[advocacy groups]] for specific interests. The citizens have to reclaim their place in decision making. He calls this post-post-democracy.

The [[Occupy movement]] was a form of more or less disorganized opposition that grew out of the dissatisfaction with to the power of the [[bank]]ing industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5431">'''''Power politics''''' is a book by [[International Relations]] scholar [[Martin Wight]], first published in 1946 as a 68-page essay.  After 1959 Wight added twelve further chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hall]], ''The International Thought of Martin Wight, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Other works of Wight's were added by his former students, [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Carsten Holbraad]], and a combined volume was published in 1978, six years after Wight's death.  The book provides an overview of international politics featuring many elements of ''[[Realpolitik]]'' analysis.

==Religion==
Wight, a pacifist and devout Christian, was appalled by [[World War II]]. He favoured a revival of the biblical term [[Antichrist]] to describe recurrent warlike situations in history - Antichrist in this context meaning a "demonic concentration of power" rather than a person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hall]], ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter one he observes that the modern state has become "the ultimate loyalty for which men will fight. The mediaeval world of 'rights and wrongs' has been replaced by a modern one of 'powers, forces, dynasties and ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power Politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Wight begins: "Power politics is a colloquial phrase for international politics."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that states exploit power to achieve expansion and dominance; "every dominant power aspires... to become a universal empire."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  For diplomatic reasons, "dominant powers" are euphemized as "Great Powers ... who wish to monopolise (sic) the right to create international conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Powers win and lose their status through violence, and are defined by their ability to wage war; they are decreasing in number, but those remaining are increasing in size.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that War and revolution go together:  communism provoked fascist and Nazi responses; and both ideologies were led by "gangsters" seeking to rule the world.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  To suppose that revolutionary ideologies have now been discarded is to show ignorance of human nature, says Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wight, though states are few in number, they are widely diverse and atypical in character.  States are more or less immortal,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore unindictable in law.  International law is weak, unclear, decentralized, unpoliced, and therefore unenforceable; there is no sovereign power above states.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, pp. 110-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, he concludes "domestically, power is constrained by law; but internationally, law is governed and constrained by the struggle for power ... There is no international society, only "international anarchy". International politics is really "power politics", and the causes of war are inherent therein".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, pp. 102-5.&lt;/ref&gt; And, furthermore, '"diplomacy is a 'European invention imposed on the world,'"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; which "consists in information, negotiation, and communication, but also, covertly, in espionage, subversion and propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chapters examine alliances, the "balance of power", arms races, disarmament, and the supra-national authority of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].  Wight concludes that "security" is inseparable from moral behavior and cites [[Gladstone]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] as examples of the latter.

==Reputation==
According to [[Charles Manning]], [[Hedley Bull]], [[Sir Michael Howard]], and [[Hans Morgenthau]] Martin Wight is one of the finest international thinkers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Porter]], review of [[Ian Hall]], ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', in ''[[International Affairs]]'', 83:4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; M. Nicholson &lt;ref&gt; 'The enigma of Martin Wight', ''[[Review of International Studies]]'', 1981&lt;/ref&gt; says: "Within the 'English school' of International Relations, the work of Martin Wight is placed in particularly high esteem. More perhaps than anyone else, he is the scholar who did IR as it ought to be done." Reviewing ''Power Politic'', F.P. King calls it a delightful book "to browse through, contemplate, refute and enjoy more than once ... Resplendent history, allusions, wit and reasoning."&lt;ref&gt; F. P. King, "[[The American Historical Review]]", volume 84/3, 1/6/1979, pp. 710-711. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Hall]] has written a detailed resumé of Wight's work:  ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12654">'''Prolonged exposure therapy''' ('''PE''') is a form of [[behavior therapy]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] designed to treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].  It is characterized by re-experiencing the traumatic event through remembering and engaging with reminders (triggers) of the trauma,  as opposed to avoiding them. Sometimes, this technique is referred to as [[Flooding (psychology)|flooding]].

==Overview==
[[File:Edna Foa David Shankbone 2010.jpg|thumb|Dr. Edna Foa]]
Prolonged exposure therapy was developed by [[Edna B Foa]], PhD, Director of the [http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/ Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety]. Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is a theoretically-based and highly effective {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} treatment for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related depression, anxiety, and anger.  PE falls under the category of "exposure-based therapy"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lancaster CL, Teeters JB, Gros DF, Back SE | title = Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Overview of Evidence-Based Assessment and Treatment | journal = Journal of Clinical Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 4 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27879650 | doi = 10.3390/jcm5110105 | url = https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/5/11/105 | first8 = Sudie E. | last8 = Back | last5 = Lancaster | last7 = Gros | last6 = Teeters | first5 = Cynthia L. | first6 = Jenni B. | first7 = Daniel F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by scientific studies which reflect its positive impact on patient symptoms &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Granato HF, Wilks CR, Miga EM, Korslund KE, Linehan MM | title = The Use of Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Prolonged Exposure to Treat Comorbid Dissociation and Self-Harm: The Case of a Client With Borderline Personality Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 8 | pages = 805–15 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26227284 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.22207 | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jclp.22207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.    

Exposure-based therapies focus on confronting the harmless triggers of trauma/stress in order to dissociate them from the feelings of anxiety and stress&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  Prolonged exposure is a flexible therapy that can be modified to fit the needs of individual clients. It is specifically designed to help clients psychologically process traumatic events and reduce trauma-induced psychological disturbances. Prolonged exposure produces clinically significant improvement in about 80% of patients with chronic PTSD.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} 

Over years of testing and development, prolonged exposure has evolved into an adaptable program of intervention to address the needs of varied trauma survivors.&lt;ref name="ptsd"/&gt; In addition to reducing symptoms of PTSD, prolonged exposure instills confidence and a sense of mastery, improves various aspects of daily functioning, increases the ability to cope with courage when facing stress, and improves the ability to discriminate safe and unsafe situations.&lt;ref name="talk"&gt;Eftekhari, A.; Stines, L.R. &amp; Zoellner, L.A. (2006). Do You Need To Talk About It? Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of Chronic PTSD. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(1), 70–83 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Prolonged Exposure for PTSD received an Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Prolonged exposure was selected by SAMHSA and the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention as a Model Program for national dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/ptsd_treatment_ctsa.html Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety: Treatment of PTSD at the CTSA]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Components==

PTSD is characterized by the re-experiencing of the traumatic event through intrusive and upsetting memories, nightmares, flashbacks, and strong emotional and physiological reactions triggered by reminders of the trauma. Most individuals with PTSD try to ward off the intrusive symptoms and avoid the trauma-reminders, even when those reminders are not inherently dangerous. To address the traumatic memories and triggers that are reminders of the trauma, the core components of exposure programs for the disorder are:
#Imaginal exposure, revisiting the traumatic memory, repeated recounting it aloud, and processing the revisiting experience
#''In vivo'' exposure, the repeated confrontation with situations and objects that cause distress but are not inherently dangerous

The goal of this treatment is to promote processing of the trauma memory and to reduce distress and avoidance evoked by the trauma reminders. Additionally, individuals with emotional numbing and depression are encouraged to engage in enjoyable activities, even if these activities do not cause fear or anxiety but have dropped out the person's life due to loss of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M.; Cahill, S.; Foa, E. Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In ''Textbook of Anxiety Disorders'', Second Edition, ed. D. Stein, E. Hollander, B. Rothbaum, American Psychiatric Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imaginal exposure typically occurs during the therapy session and consists of retelling the trauma to the therapist. For the ''in vivo'' exposure, the clinician works with the client to establish a [[Exposure hierarchy|fear and avoidance hierarchy]] and typically assigns exposures to these list items as [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]] progressively. The therapist may also record the session and ask the patient to continue to complete in vivo exercises on their own time with the help of the recording.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both components work by facilitating emotional processing so that the problematic traumatic memories and avoidances habituate (desensitize).&lt;ref&gt;Kazi, A.; Freund, B. &amp; Ironson, G. (2008). Prolonged Exposure Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder following the 9/11 attack with a person who escaped from the Twin Towers. ''Clinical Case Studies'', 7, 100–16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Randomized control trials reflect that only 10-38% of PTSD patients who take part in PE therapy terminate treatment before their program is complete (generally after at least 8 sessions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Studies==

Practitioners throughout the United States and many other countries currently use prolonged exposure to successfully treat survivors of varied traumas including rape, assault, child abuse, combat, motor vehicle accidents, and disasters. Prolonged exposure has been beneficial for those suffering from co-occurring PTSD and substance abuse when combined with substance abuse treatment.&lt;ref name="ptsd"&gt;Joseph, J.S. &amp; Gray, M.J. (2008). Exposure Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1(4), 69–80 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also reflected that prolonged exposure therapy aids patients who suffer from both PTSD and borderline personality disorder when the treatment is coupled with [[dialectical behavior therapy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Some were concerned that PE would negatively affect the treatment of patients with [[substance abuse disorder]] (SUD) as purposefully and intentionally exposing them to their reminders and triggers may worsen their state; however,  randomized control trial studies exist which indicate that there are no negative effects of using PE for patients with SUD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemmis LK, Wanigaratne S, Ehntholt KA | title = Emotional Processing in Individuals with Substance Use Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder | journal = International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 900–918 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28798555 | pmc = 5529498 | doi = 10.1007/s11469-016-9727-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducted studies have reflected positively on the effectiveness of PE.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dixon LE, Ahles E, Marques L | title = Treating Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Diverse Settings: Recent Advances and Challenges for the Future | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 108 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27771824 | pmc = 5533577 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-016-0748-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the Netherlands, patients responded better to PE than to eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  6 month follow ups revealed that PE had also lessened psychotic and schizophrenic issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Furthermore, in Israel, the symptoms of in a small group of female methadone users in Israel had decreased after PE treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; PE therapy was also found to be superior to [[supportive therapy]] in sexually abused women with PTSD in a [[randomized controlled trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foa EB, McLean CP, Capaldi S, Rosenfield D | title = Prolonged exposure vs supportive counseling for sexual abuse-related PTSD in adolescent girls: a randomized clinical trial | journal = Jama | volume = 310 | issue = 24 | pages = 2650–7 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24368465 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2013.282829 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1793800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shotgun email''' refers to an [[email]] requesting information or action that only requires the efforts of one person but is sent to multiple people in an effort to guarantee that at least one person will respond. The shotgun email often results in multiple people responding to something already accomplished and therefore results in a loss of overall productivity. Shotgun emailing is considered poor [[Netiquette|internet etiquette]].

An example would be a person of authority in a business organization sending out an email to five technicians in the [[information technology]] department of his company to let them know his [[computer printer|printer]] is broken. One technician responds with an on-site call and fixes the problem. Later in the day, other technicians follow-up to fix the printer that is already back in order. Shotgun emails can also be request for information or other tasks.

The blind shotgun email occurs when the sender uses the blind co-copy feature of an email program to hide the fact that a shotgun email is in use. This is considered particularly deceitful.

The '''silent service code''' is a way for a diner to "talk" to [[Waiting staff|servers]] during a meal without saying a word, mainly to tell them that the diner is finished.  This will prevent any embarrassing situations where the server would take a meal prematurely.

To tell a server you have finished place your [[napkin]] to the left of your [[Plate (dishware)|plate]], and place all your [[food utensil|utensils]] together in a "4-o'clock" position on your plate.

Utensils crossed on a plate signify that a diner is still eating.

If you must leave during the meal, you should place the napkin on your chair to avoid any confusion.

The code is almost always taught during business dining [[etiquette]] classes.

'''Social competence''' consists of [[social]], [[emotional]], [[cognitive]] and behavioral skills needed for successful social adaptation. Social competence also reflects having an ability to take another's perspective concerning a situation, learn from past experiences, and apply that learning to the changes in social interactions.&lt;ref name="semrud"&gt;{{cite book |last=Semrud-Clikeman |first=M. |title=Social competence in children |year=2007 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social competence is the foundation upon which expectations for future interaction with others is built, and upon which individuals develop perceptions of their own behavior. Social competence frequently encompasses [[social skills]], [[social communication]], and [[interpersonal communication]].&lt;ref name="semrud" /&gt;

==History==
Past and current research intends to further the understanding of how and why social competence is important in healthy social development. The study of social competence began in the early 20th century. A noteworthy discovery was that social competence was related to future [[mental health]], thus fueling research on how children interact with their peers and function in social situations.&lt;ref name="site"&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/~dwong/StudentWorkArchive/CEP900F01-RIP/Knapp-SocialCompetence.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; As research developed, different definitions and measurement techniques developed to suit these new findings.

In the 1930s, researchers began investigating [[peer groups]] and how children's characteristics affected their positions within these peer groups. In the 1950s and 1960s, research established that children's social competence was related to future mental health (such as maladaptive outcomes in adulthood), as well as problems in school settings.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; Research on social competence expanded greatly from this point on, as increasing amounts of evidence demonstrated the importance of social interactions.

Mid-century, researchers began to view social competence in terms of [[problem-solving]] skills and strategies in social situations. Social competence was now conceptualized in terms of effective social functioning and [[information processing]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, research began focusing on the impact of children's behavior on relationships,&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; which influenced the study of the effectiveness of teaching children social skills that are age, gender, and context specific.

In an effort to determine why some children were not exhibiting social skills in some interactions, many researchers devised social information processing models to explain what happens in a social interaction.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; These models concentrated on factors in interactions such as behavior, how people process and judge each other, and how they process social cues. They also focus on how people select social goals, decide on the best response to a situation and enacting the chosen response. Studies such as this often looked at the relationship between [[social cognition]] and social competence.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt;

A prominent researcher of social competence in the mid-1980s was Frank Gresham. He identified three sub-domains of social competence: adaptive behavior, social skills, and peer acceptance (peer acceptance is often used to assess social competence). Research during this time often focused on children who were not displaying social skills in efforts to identify and help these children who were potentially at risk of long-term negative outcomes due to poor social interactions.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; Gresham proposed that these children could have one of four deficits: skill deficits, in which children did not have the knowledge or cognitive abilities to carry out a certain behavior, performance deficits, self-control skill deficits, and self-control performance deficits, in which children had excessive anxiety or impulsivity that prohibited proper execution of the behaviors or skills they knew and understood.

Despite all the developments and changes in the conceptualization of social competence throughout the 20th century, there was still a general lack of agreement about the definition and measurement of social competence during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dodge |first1=K.A. |title=Research on Motivation in Education |year=1989 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego, CA |author2=Asher, S.R. &amp; Parkhurst, J.T. |editor=C. Ames &amp; R. Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions of the 1980s were less ambiguous than previous definitions, but they often did not acknowledge the age, situation, and skill specificity implicit in the complex construct of social competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pellegrini |first=A.D. |title=The Child at School: Interaction with Peers and Teachers |year=2000 |publisher=Arnold |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches and theories==

===Peer regard/status approaches===
These approaches define social competence based on how [[popularity|popular]] one is with his peers.&lt;ref name="stump"&gt;{{cite book |title=Social competence |last1=Stump |first1=K.N. |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Science + Business Media; US |location=New York, NY, US |pages=23–37 |author2=Ratliff, J.M.; Wu, Y.P.; Hawley, P.H. |editor=Matson, J.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more well-liked one is, the more socially competent they are.&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rose-Krasnor |first=L. |title=The nature of social competence: A theoretical review |journal=Social Development |year=1997 |volume=6 |pages=111–35 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9507.1997.tb00097.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social skill approaches===
These approaches use [[behaviors]] as a guideline.&lt;ref name="stump"/&gt; Behaviors that demonstrate social skills are compiled and are collectively identified as social competence.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/34551310/The-Principles-of-Social-Competence].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship approaches===
According to these approaches, social competence is assessed by the quality of one's [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and the ability to form relationships. Competence depends on the skills of both members of the relationship; a child may appear more socially competent if interacting with a socially skilled partner.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt; Commentators on some online [[incel]] communities have advocated government programs wherein socially awkward men are helped or women are incentivized to go on dates with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/socially-anxiety-dating-government-should-pay-women-date-men_n_3293626&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional approaches===
The functional approach is context-specific and concerned with the identification of social goals and tasks. This approach also focuses on the outcomes of social behavior and the processes leading to those outcomes. Information-processing models of social skills are important here, and based on the idea that social competence results from social-cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;

==Models==
Early models of social competence stress the role of context and situation specificity in operationalizing the competence construct.&lt;ref name="goldfried"&gt;{{cite book |title=Current topics in clinical and community psychology |year=1969 |publisher=Academic |location=New York |pages=151–96 |author1=Goldfried, M.R. |author2=D'Zurilla, T.J. |editor=C. Spielberger}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models also allow for the organization and integration of the various component skills, behaviors and cognitions associated with social competence. Whereas global definitions focus on the "ends" rather than the "means" by which such ends are achieved,&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt; a number of models directly attend to the theorized processes underlying competence.&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=N.R. |author2=Dodge, K.A. |title=A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=1994 |volume=115 |pages=74–101 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="felner"&gt;{{cite book |title=The development of social competence in adolescence |year=1990 |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills, CA |pages=245–64 |author1=Felner, R.D. |author2=Lease, A.M. &amp; Phillips, R.S.C. |editor=T.P. Gullota, G.R. Adams &amp; R. Montemayor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These process models are context specific and seek to identify critical social goals and tasks associated with social competence. Other models focus on the often overlooked distinction between social competence and the indices (i.e., skills and abilities) used to gauge it.

===Behavioral–analytic model===
Goldfried and D'Zurilla&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt; developed a five-step behavioral-analytic model outlining a definition of social competence.

The specific steps proposed in the model include: (1) situational analysis, (2) response enumeration, (3) response evaluation, (4) measure development, and (5) evaluation of the measure.
#Situation analysis – a critical situation is defined on the basis of certain criteria, which include:
##occurs with some frequency
##presents a difficult response decision
##results in a range of possible responses in a given population.&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt; Situation identification and analysis is accomplished through a variety of methods, including direct observation by self or others, interviews, and surveys.
#Response enumeration – sampling of possible responses to each situation is obtained. Procedures for generating response alternatives include direct observation, role plays, and simulations in video and/or written formats.
#Response evaluation – the enumerated responses are judged for effectiveness by "significant others" in the environment. An important element is that a consensus must emerge or the particular item is removed from future consideration.

In the last two steps (4 and 5) a measure for assessing social competence is developed and evaluated.

===Social information-processing model===
A social information-processing model is a widely used means for understanding social competence.&lt;ref name="crick"/&gt; The social information-processing model focuses more directly on the cognitive processes underlying response selection, enactment, and evaluation. Using a computer metaphor, the reformulated social information-processing model outlines a six-step nonlinear process with various feedback loops linking children's social cognition and behavior. Difficulties that arise at any of the steps generally translates into social competence deficits.    

The six steps are:
#Observation and encoding of relevant stimuli – attending to and encoding non-verbal and verbal social cues, both external and internal.
#Interpretation and mental representation of cues – understanding what has happened during the social encounter, as well as the cause and intent underlying the interaction.
#Clarification of goals – determining what one's objective is for the interaction and how to put forth an understanding of those goals.
#Representation of situation is developed by accessing long-term memory or construction – the interaction is compared to previous situations stored in long-term memory and the previous outcomes of those interactions.
#Response decision/selection
#Behavioral enactment and evaluation

===Tri-component model===
Another way to conceptualize social competence is to consider three underlying subcomponents in a hierarchical framework.&lt;ref name="cavell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cavell |first=T.A. |title=Social adjustment, social performance, and social skills: A tri-component model of social competence |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |year=1990 |volume=19 |pages=111–22 |doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp1902_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Social Adjustment
#Social Performance
#Social Skills

The top of the hierarchy includes the most advanced level, social adjustment. Social adjustment is defined as the extent to which an individual achieves society's developmentally appropriate goals.&lt;ref name= "cavell"/&gt; The goals are conceived of as different "statuses" to be achieved by members of a society (e.g., health, legal, academic or occupational, socioeconomic, social, emotional, familial, and relational statuses). The next level is social performance&amp;nbsp;– or the degree to which an individual's responses to relevant social situations meet socially valid criteria. The lowest level of the hierarchy is social skills, which are defined as specific abilities (i.e. overt behavior, social cognitive skills, and emotional regulation) allowing for the competent performance within social tasks.

===The quadripartite model===
The essential core elements of competence are theorized to consist of four superordinate sets of skills, abilities, and capacities: (1) cognitive skills and abilities, (2) behavioral skills, (3) emotional competencies, and (4) motivational and expectancy sets.&lt;ref name="felner"/&gt;
#Cognitive skills and abilities – cultural and social knowledge necessary for effective functioning in society (i.e., academic and occupational skills and abilities, decision-making ability, and the processing of information)
#Behavioral skills – knowledge of behavioral responses and the ability to enact them (i.e., negotiation, role- or perspective-taking, assertiveness, conversational skills, and prosocial skills)
#Emotional skills – affect regulation and affective capacities for facilitating socially competent responding and forming relationships
#Motivational and expectancy sets – an individual's value structure, moral development, and sense of efficacy and control.

==The developmental framework==
Social competence develops over time, and the mastery of social skills and interpersonal social interactions emerge at various time points on the developmental continuum (infancy to adolescence) and build on previously learned skills and knowledge.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; Key facets and markers of social competence that are remarkably consistent across the developmental periods (early childhood, middle/late childhood, adolescence) include prosocial skills (i.e., friendly, cooperative, helpful behaviors) and self-control or regulatory skills (i.e., anger management, negotiation skills, problem-solving skills).&lt;ref name= "semrud"/&gt; However, as developmental changes occur in the structure and quality of interactions, as well as in cognitive and language abilities, these changes affect the complexity of skills and behaviors contributing to socially competent responding.

==Contributing factors==

===Temperament===
[[Temperament]] is a construct that describes a person's biological response to the environment.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; Issues such as soothability, rhythmicity, [[sociability]], and [[arousal]] make up this construct.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; Most often sociability contributes to the development of social competence.

===Attachment===
Social experiences rest on the foundation of parent–child relationships, and are important in the later development of social skills and behaviors. Attachment of an infant to a care-giver is important for the development of later social skills and behaviors&lt;ref name="ainsworth"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ainsworth |first=M. |title=Infant-mother attachment |journal=American Psychologist |year=1979 |volume=34 |pages=932–7 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.34.10.932 |pmid=517843 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that develop social competence. Attachment helps the infant learn that the world is predictable and trustworthy or in other instances capricious and cruel. [[Mary Ainsworth|Ainsworth]]&lt;ref name= "ainsworth"/&gt; describes four types of attachment styles in infancy, including [[security|secure]], [[anxious–avoidant attachment|anxious–avoidant]], anxious–resistant and disorganized/disoriented. The foundation of the attachment bond allows the child to venture out from his/her mother to try new experiences and new interactions. Children with secure attachment styles tend to show higher levels of social competence relative to children with unsecure attachment, including anxious–avoidant, anxious–resistant, and disorganized/disoriented.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt;

===Parenting style===
Parents are the primary source of social and emotional development in infancy, early, and middle/late childhood. The socialization practices of parents influence whether their child will develop social competence. Parenting style captures two important elements of parenting: parental warmth/responsiveness and parental control/demandingness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of child psychology |volume=Vol. 4. Socialization, personality, and social development |year=1983 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |pages=1–101 |author1=Maccoby, E.E. |edition=4th |author2=Martin, J.A. |editor=P.H. Mussen &amp; E.M. Hetherington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental responsiveness (warmth or supportiveness) refers to "the extent to which parents intentionally foster individuality, self-regulation, and self-assertion by being attuned, supportive, and acquiescent to children's special needs and demands."&lt;ref name="baumrind"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumrind |first=D. |title=The influence of parenting style on adolescent competence and substance use |journal= [[Journal of Early Adolescence]] |year=1991 |volume=11 |pages=56–95 |doi=10.1177/0272431691111004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental demandingness (behavioral control) refers to "the claims parents make on children to become integrated into the family whole, by their maturity demands, supervision, disciplinary efforts and willingness to confront the child who disobeys."&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt; Categorizing parents according to whether they are high or low on parental demandingness and responsiveness creates a typology of four [[parenting styles]]: [[indulgent]]/[[permissive]], [[authoritarian]], [[authoritative]], and [[Principle of indifference|indifferent]]/uninvolved. Each of these parenting styles reflects patterns of parental values, practices, and behaviors&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt; and a distinct balance of responsiveness and demandingness.

Parenting style contributes to child well-being in the domains of social competence, academic performance, psychosocial development, and problem behavior.&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt; Research based on parent interviews, child reports, and parent observations consistently find that:
* Children and adolescents whose parents are authoritative rate themselves and are rated by objective measures as more socially and instrumentally competent than those whose parents are nonauthoritative.&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=L.H. |author2=Schwarz, J.C. |title=The relationship between parenting types and older adolescents' personality, academic achievement, adjustment, and substance use |journal= [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] |year=1996 |volume=67 |pages=2,101–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=N.B. |author2=Cowan, P.A.; Cowan, C.P. &amp; Hetherington, E.M. |title=Externalizing in preschoolers and early adolescents: A cross-study replication of a family model |journal= [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] |year=1993 |volume=29 |pages=3–18 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children and adolescents whose parents are uninvolved perform most poorly in all domains.

Other factors that contribute to social competence include teacher relationships, peer groups, neighborhood, and community.

==Related problem behaviors==
An important researcher in the study of social competence, Voeller, states that there are three clusters of problem behaviors that lead to the impairment of social competence.&lt;ref name="voeller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frames of reference for the assessment of learning disabilities: New views on measurement issues |year=1994 |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing Company |location=Baltimore |pages=523–54 |author= Voeller, K.K.S. |editor=G.R. Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voeller clusters include: (1) an aggressive and hostile group, (2) a perceptual deficits subgroup, and (3) a group with difficulties in self-regulation.
#Children with aggressive and hostile behaviors are those whose acting out behaviors negatively influence their ability to form relationships, and sustain interpersonal interactions.&lt;ref name="voeller"/&gt; Aggressive and hostile children tend to have deficiencies in social information-processing, and employ inappropriate social problem solving strategies to social situations.&lt;ref name="voeller"/&gt; They also tend to search for fewer facts in a social situation and pay more attention to the aggressive social interactions presented in an interaction.&lt;ref name="crick"/&gt;
#Children with perceptual deficits do not perceive the environment appropriately and interpret interpersonal interactions inaccurately. They also have difficulty reading social cues, facial expressions and body gestures.
#Children with self-regulation deficits tend to have the classic difficulties in executive functions.

==Assessments==
While understanding the components of social competence continue to be empirically validated, the assessment of social competence is not well-studied&lt;ref name= "principles" /&gt; and continues to develop in procedures.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; There are a variety of methods for the assessment of social competence and often include one (or more) of the following:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Child&amp;ndash;adolescent interview
* Observations
* Parent report measures
* Self-report measures
* Sociometric measures (i.e., peer nominations)
* Teachers report measures
{{div col end}}

==Interventions==
Following the increased awareness of the importance of social competence in childhood, interventions are used to help children with social difficulties. Historically, intervention efforts did not improve children's peer status or yield long-lasting effects. Interventions did not take into account that social competence problems do not occur in isolation, but alongside other problems as well. Thus, current intervention efforts target social competence both directly and indirectly in varying contexts.

===Preschool and early-childhood interventions===
Early childhood interventions targeting social skills directly improve the peer relations of children. These interventions focus on at-risk groups such as single, adolescent mothers and families of children with early behavior problems. Interventions targeting both children and families have the highest success rates. When children reach preschool age, social competence interventions focus on the preschool context and teach prosocial skills. Such interventions generally entail teaching problem-solving and conflict management skills, sharing, and improving parenting skills. Interventions improve children's social competence and interactions with peers in the short-term and they also reduce long-term risk, such as substance abuse or delinquent behavior.

===School-age interventions===
Social competence becomes more complicated as children grow older, and most intervention efforts for this age group target individual skills, the family, and the classroom setting. These programs focus on training skills in problem solving, emotional understanding, cooperation, and self-control. Understanding one's emotions, and the ability to communicate these emotions, is strongly emphasized. The most effective programs give children the opportunity to practice the new skills that they learn. Results of social competence interventions include decreased aggression, improved self-control, and increased conflict resolution skills.

'''Social simulation''' is a research field that applies [[computer|computational]] methods to study issues in the [[social sciences]]. The issues explored include problems in [[computational law]], [[psychology]],&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H. P.

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* '''[[norm (social)|Social norms]]''': [[Robert Axelrod]] has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Axelrod (1986): [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/Axelrod%20Norms%20APSR%201986%20(2).pdf An Evolutionary Approach to Norms]&lt;/ref&gt; others have modeled the emergence of norms using [[meme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flentge, Daniel Polani and Thomas Uthmann (2001) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/4/3.html Modelling the Emergence of Possession Norms using Memes]&lt;/ref&gt; or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Staller and Paolo Petta (2001): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/2.html Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Neumann (2008): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/6.html Homo Socionicus: a Case Study of Simulation Models of Norms] for an overview of the recent (as of 2008) research.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Institutions]]''': by investigating under what conditions agents manage to coordinate,&lt;ref&gt;José Castro Caldas and Helder Coelho (1999): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/2/1.html The Origin of Institutions: socio-economic processes, choice, norms and conventions]&lt;/ref&gt; or by modeling the works of [[Robert Putnam]] on civic traditions&lt;ref&gt;Dan Miodownik, Britt Cartrite and Ravi Bhavnani (2010): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/3/1.html Between Replication and Docking: "Adaptive Agents, Political Institutions, and Civic Traditions" Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation" or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council [http://www.esrc.ac.uk ESRC]. For further details please see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20091209031009/http://www.genesis.ucl.ac.uk/ GENESIS Web Page] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091114023426/http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/genesisblog/ Blog].
*"National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation" or (NeISS) is a UK-based project funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk JISC]. For further details please see: [http://www.neiss.org.uk The NeISS Web Pages].
*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

[[File:Ephesus37.jpg|thumb|[[Anthropomorphism|Personification]] of [[Wisdom]] ({{lang-grc-koi|Σοφία}}, {{transl|el|Sophía}}) at the [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]] (second century).]]
'''Sophia''' ({{lang-grc-koi|[[wikt:σοφία|σοφία]]}} ''sophía'' "[[wisdom]]") is a central idea in [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Hellenistic religion|religion]], [[Platonism]], [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Gnosticism]], and [[Christian theology]]. Originally carrying a meaning of "cleverness, skill", the later meaning of the term, close to the meaning of ''[[Phronesis]]'' ("wisdom, intelligence"), was significantly shaped by the term ''[[philosophy]]'' ("love of ''sophia''") as used by [[Plato]].

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches, [[Holy Wisdom]] ({{lang|grc|Αγία Σοφία}} ''Hagía Sophía'') is an expression for [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]) in the [[Trinity]] (as in the dedication of the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]) and, rarely, for the [[Holy Spirit]].

References to ''Sophia'' in [[Koine Greek]] translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]] translate to the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] term ''[[Chokhmah]]''.

==Greek and Hellenistic tradition==
{{Further|Logos|Phronesis|Seven Sages of Greece|Gnosis}}
The [[Ancient Greek]] word ''sophia'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφία|σοφία]]}}, {{transl|grc|sophía}}) is the [[abstract noun]] of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφός|σοφός]]}} ({{transl|grc|sophós}}), which variously translates to "clever, skillful, intelligent, wise". These words share the same [[Proto-Indo-European root]] as the [[Latin]] verb {{lang|la|[[wikt:sapere|sapere]]}} ({{Literal translation|"to taste; discern"|lk=on}}), whence {{lang|la|[[wikt:sapientia|sapientia]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] [[s.v.]] [https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/lex/master/1652  sap-, sab- "to taste, savvy, perceive"].&lt;/ref&gt; The noun {{lang|grc|σοφία}} as "skill in handicraft and art" is [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] and in [[Pindar]] is used to describe both [[Hephaestos]] and [[Athena]].

Before [[Plato]], the term for "sound judgement, intelligence, practical wisdom" and so on, such qualities as are ascribed to the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], was ''[[phronesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις|φρόνησις]]}}, {{transl|grc|phrónēsis}}), from ''[[phren]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρήν|φρήν]]}}, {{transl|grc|phrēn}}, {{Literal translation|"mind"}}), while ''sophia'' referred to technical skill. 

The term ''[[Philosophy|philosophia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φῐλοσοφῐ́ᾱ}}, {{transl|grc|philosophíā}}, {{Literal translation|"love of wisdom"}}) was primarily used after the time of [[Plato]], following his teacher [[Socrates]], though it has been said that [[Pythagoras]] was the first to call himself a philosopher. This understanding of ''philosophia'' permeates Plato's dialogues, especially the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In that work, the leaders of the proposed [[utopia]] are to be [[philosopher king]]s: rulers who are lovers of wisdom. According to Plato in ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates himself was dubbed "the wisest [{{lang|grc|σοφώτατός}}, {{transl|grc|sophṓtatós}}] man of Greece" by the [[Pythia|Pythian Oracle]]. Socrates defends this verdict in ''Apology'' to the effect that he, at least, [[I know that I know nothing|knows that he knows nothing]]. Socratic [[skepticism]] is contrasted with the approach of the [[sophist]]s, who are attacked in ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' for relying merely on [[eloquence]]. [[Cicero]] in {{lang|la|De Oratore}} later criticized Plato for his separation of wisdom from eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, James (2005). ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction''. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. p. 103. {{ISBN|0-205-41492-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sophia'' is named as one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] (in place of ''phronesis'') in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''.

[[Philo]], a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenized Jew]] writing in [[Alexandria]], attempted to harmonize Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophical concepts]], he used the Koine term ''[[logos]]'' ({{lang|grc|λόγος}}, {{transl|grc|lógos}}) for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the [[Gospel of John]] in the opening verses and applied to Jesus as the Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) of [[God the Father]].&lt;ref name="Harris John"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "John". pp. 302–310&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gnosticism]], Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the [[soul]], but also simultaneously one of the [[emanation]]s of the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]]. Gnostics held that she was the [[aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] of Jesus (i.e. the [[Bride of Christ]]) and was the [[Holy Spirit]] of the [[Trinity]]. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of {{transl|grc|Achamṓth}} ({{lang|grc|Ἀχαμώθ}}; {{lang-he-n|[[wikt:חוכמה#Hebrew|חוכמה]]}}, {{transl|he|[[Chokhmah|ḥokhmāh]]}}) and as {{transl|grc|Proúnikos}} ({{lang|grc|Προύνικος}}).

==Christian theology==
{{main|Holy Wisdom}}
[[File:Holy Wisdom (16th c., Vologda museum).jpg|thumb|220px|Icon of  Divine Wisdom {{lang|ru|София Премудрость Божия}}) from St George Church in [[Vologda]]  (16th century)]]
[[Christian theology]] received the Old Testament personification of Divine Wisdom ([[Septuagint]] ''Sophia'', [[Vulgate]] ''Sapientia''). The connection of Divine Wisdom to the concept of the Logos resulted in the interpretation of "Holy Wisdom" (''Hagia Sophia'') as an aspect of Christ the Logos.&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], ''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]''.

The expression {{lang|grc|Ἁγία Σοφία}} itself is not found in the [[New Testament]], even though passages in the [[Pauline epistles]] equate Christ with the "wisdom of God" ({{lang|grc|θεοῦ σοφία}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] 1:24b {{lang|grc|Χριστὸν θεοῦ δύναμιν καὶ θεοῦ σοφίαν}} "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God", 1:30 {{lang|grc| ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὲ ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ὃς ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν σοφία ἀπὸ θεοῦ δικαιοσύνη τε καὶ ἁγιασμὸς καὶ ἀπολύτρωσις}} "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption"&lt;/ref&gt; The clearest form of the identification of Divine Wisdom with Christ comes in 1 Corinthians 1:17-2:13. In 1 Cor. 2:7, Paul speaks of the Wisdom of God as a [[Sacred mysteries|mystery]] which was "ordained before the world unto our glory". 

===Christology===
Following 1 Corinthians, the [[Church Fathers]] named Christ as "Wisdom of God".&lt;ref&gt;"Following St. Paul's reference to 'Christ who is the wisdom of God and the power of God', all the rest of the Church Fathers identified Sophia-Wisdom with Christ, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity"  Dennis O'Neill, ''Passionate Holiness: Marginalized Christian Devotions for Distinctive Peoples'' (2010), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qjl1H9GcetMC&amp;pg=PA6  p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, when rebutting claims about Christ's ignorance, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] insisted that, inasmuch as he was divine, Christ knew everything: "How can he be ignorant of anything that is, when he is Wisdom, the maker of the worlds, who brings all things to fulfilment and recreates all things, who is the end of all that has come into being?" (''Orationes'', 30.15). [[Irenaeus]] represents another, minor patristic tradition which identified the Spirit of God, and not Christ himself, as "Wisdom" (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'', 4.20.1–3; cf. 3.24.2; 4.7.3; 4.20.3). He could appeal to Paul's teaching about wisdom being one of the gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]] (1 Cor. 12:8). However, the majority applied to Christ the title/name of "Wisdom". 

[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] basilica (section)]]
[[Constantine the Great]] set a pattern for Eastern Christians by dedicating a church to Christ as the personification of Divine Wisdom.&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; In [[Constantinople]], under [[Justinian I]], the Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") was rebuilt, consecrated in 538, and became a model for many other Byzantine churches. 
In the Latin Church, however, "the Word" or ''Logos'' came through more clearly than "the Wisdom" of God as a central, [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|high title of Christ]].  

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Holy Wisdom is understood as the Divine Logos who became [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] as Jesus;&lt;ref name="PMP"/&gt; this belief being sometimes also expressed in some Eastern Orthodox icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=108957 |title=OCA - Feasts and Saints |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}

There is a hagiographical tradition, dating to the late sixth century,&lt;ref name=Saxer&gt;V. Saxer, "Sophia v. Rom" in: ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche'' vol. 9 (1993), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=3n7YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA733#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 733f.]&lt;/ref&gt; of a Saint Sophia and her three daughters, [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity]]. This has been taken as the [[veneration]] of [[allegory|allegorical figures]] from an early time, and the group of saints has become popular in Russian Orthodox iconography as such (the names of the daughters rendered as {{lang|cu|Вѣра, Надежда, Любовь}}). The veneration of the three saints named for the three [[theological virtues]] probably arose in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|f/fides_spes|band=17|autor= Ekkart Sauser|year=2000|artikel= Fides, Spes und Charitas: hl. Märtyrerinnen|spalte=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{See|Holy Wisdom (iconography)}}
[[File:Holy Wisdom created home.jpg|thumb|"Wisdom hath builded her house" ([[:ru:Премудрость созда Себе дом|Премудрость созда Себе дом]], Novgorod, 16th century).]]
The Christological identification of Christ the Logos with Divine Wisdom (''Hagia Sophia'') is strongly represented in the iconographic tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. A type of icon of the [[Theotokos]] is "Wisdom hath builded Her house" ([[:ru:Премудрость созда Себе дом|Премудрость созда Себе дом]]), a quote from Proverbs 9:1 ("Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars") interpreted as prefiguring the incarnation, with the Theotokos being the "house" chosen by the "[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] Wisdom" (i.e. "Wisdom" as a person of the [[Trinity]]).

===Christian mysticism===
{{see|Sophiology}}
In [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox mysticism]], ''Sophia'' became increasingly indistinguishable from the person of the ''Theotokos'' (rather than Christ), to the point of the implication of the ''Theotokos'' as a "fourth person of the Trinity".

Such interpretations became popular in the late nineteenth to early twentienth century, forwarded by authors such as  [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and [[Sergei Bulgakov]].
Bulgakov's theology, known as "[[Sophiology|Sophianism]]", presented Divine Wisdom as "consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity", operating as the aspect of consubstantiality (ousia or physis, substantia or natura) or "hypostaticity" of the Trinity of the three hypostases, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, "which safeguards the unity of the Holy Trinity". &lt;ref&gt;[[Sergei Bulgakov]], "Sophia. The Wisdom of God" (1937/1993), p. 23-25; see also: [[Sergei Bulgakov]], "Hypostasis and hypostaticity: scholia to the unfading light" In: St Vladimir's Theological Quarterly 49(1-2)(2005), 5-46.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the topic of a highly political controversy in the early 1930s and was condemned as heretical 
in 1935.&lt;ref name="PMP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomazansky|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Pomazansky|title=Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n6DoAEACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood|isbn=978-0-938635-69-7 | pages=357 ff}}; online at {{cite web |title=Orthodox dogmatic theology: text - IntraText CT |url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P2O.HTM |website=Intratext}}&lt;/ref&gt;online [ Intratext.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Sophianism |title=Orthodoxwiki states this also as heresy |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] tradition in England, [[Jane Leade]], seventeenth-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Christian universalism|Universalist]], and founder of the [[Philadelphians|Philadelphian Society]], wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the "Virgin Sophia" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirst|first=Julie|authorlink=Julie Hirst|title=Jane Leade: Biography of a Seventeenth-century Mystic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_afNy02glYC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|isbn=978-0-7546-5127-7|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Leade was hugely influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] writings of sixteenth century [[Germany|German]] Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as ''The Way to Christ'' (1624).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob Böhme]], ''The Way to Christ'' (1622) [http://www.passtheword.org/DIALOGS-FROM-THE-PAST/waychrst.htm Passtheword.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]] and religious leaders, including [[George Rapp]] and the [[Harmony Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Versluis,  "Western Esotericism and The Harmony Society", ''Esoterica I'' (1999) pp. 20-47 [http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Versluis.html MSU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personification==
''Sophia'' is not a "goddess" in classical Greek tradition; Greek goddesses associated with wisdom are [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] and [[Athena]] (Latin [[Minerva]]). By the [[Roman Empire]], it became common to depict the [[cardinal virtues]] and other abstract ideals, as female [[allegory|allegories]]. Thus, in the Library of Celsus in [[Ephesus]], built in the 2nd century, there are four statues of female allegories, depicting wisdom (Sophia), knowledge ([[Episteme]]), intelligence ([[Ennoia]]) and valour ([[Arete]]). In the same period, ''Sophia'' assumes aspects of a goddess or angelic power in [[Gnosticism]].

In [[Christian iconography]], Holy Wisdom or ''Hagia Sophia'' was depicted as a female allegory from the medieval period. In Western (Latin) tradition, she appears as a crowned virgin; in [[Holy Wisdom (iconography)|Russian Orthodox tradition]], she has a more supernatural aspect of a crowned woman with wings in a glowing red colour.
The virgin martyrs [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Faith Hope and Charity with their mother Sophia]] are depicted as three small girls standing in front of their mother in widow's dress.

''[[Allegory of Wisdom and Strength]]'' is a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]], created circa 1565 in [[Venice]]. It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting Divine Wisdom personified on the left and [[Hercules]], representing Strength and earthly concerns, on the right.

==Modern reception==
[[File:Statue_of_Sveta_Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sophia in Sofia, Bulgaria]] 
A goddess ''Sophia'' was introduced into [[Anthroposophy]] by its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], in his book ''The Goddess: From Natura to Divine Sophia''&lt;ref name="Steiner "&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=o7XNn_THKKAC&amp;vq=Sophia&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The Goddess: From Natura to the Divine Sophia : Selections from the Work of Rudolf Steiner | publisher=Sophia Books, Rudolf Steiner Press | author=Steiner, Rudolf | authorlink=Rudolf Steiner | year=2001 | page=96 | isbn=1855840944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a later compilation of his writings titled ''Isis Mary Sophia.'' Sophia also figures prominently in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a spiritual movement which Anthroposophy was closely related to. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of Theosophy, described it in her essay ''What is Theosophy?'' as an esoteric wisdom doctrine, and said that the "Wisdom" referred to was "an emanation of the Divine principle" typified by "...some goddesses—Metis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic Sophia..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/theosophy/what_is_theosophy.html |title=What is Theosophy? |publisher=Age-of-the-sage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Sophia has also been invoked as a goddess in [[Dianic Wicca]] and related currents of feminist spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Books relating to the contemporary pagan worship of the goddess Sophia include: ''Sophia, Goddess of Wisdom'', by Caitlin Matthews, ''The Cosmic Shekinah'' by Sorita d'Este and David Rankine (which includes Sophia as one of the major aspects of the goddess of wisdom), and ''Inner Gold: Understanding Psychological Projection'' by Robert A. Johnson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 installation artwork ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' features a place setting for Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings "Place Settings"]. Brooklyn Museum. Retrieved on 2015-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Statue of Sveta Sofia|monumental sculpture]] of Holy Wisdom depicted as a "goddess" in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria (the city itself is named after [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgtraveller.com/en/sofia/sights/stsophia.html|title=The Church of St Sophia, Sofia, Bulgaria|website=www.bgtraveller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was erected in 2000 to replace a statue of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].

[[File:Dinner at Haddo House, 1884 by Alfred Edward Emslie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The dinner party]][[Table manners]] are the cultural customs and rules of [[etiquette]] used while dining. As in other areas of [[Etiquette in North America|North American etiquette]], the rules governing appropriate table manners have changed over time and may differ depending on the setting (e.g. dining at home, at a restaurant, or with business colleagues).

== History ==
{{Undue weight|date=May 2018|to=information outside the scope of the article's title}}
Table manners have an ancient and complex history, as each society has gradually evolved its system.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rituals of Dinner|last=Visser|first=Margaret|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1992|isbn=0-8021-1116-5|location=New York|pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, many of the behaviors that take place at the dinner table are deeply rooted in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/life/celebrations/the-history-of-table-settings-and-dining-etiquette/article_ac248388-e07c-5dbf-94c8-31cf71084d76.html|title=The history of table settings and dining etiquette|last=Creative|first=Metro|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Italy more or less led the cultural revolution starting with the renaissance. Italian poet Giovanni Della Casa advised in ''Galateo'', his 1558 book on manners: "One should not comb his hair nor wash his hands in public... the exception to this is the washing of the hands when done before sitting down to dinner, for then it should be done in full sight of others, even if you do not need to wash them at all, so that whoever dips into the same bowl as you will be certain of your cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/renaissance-table-etiquette-and-the-origins-of-manners-31348606/|title=Renaissance Table Etiquette and the Origins of Manners|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other examples are:
#Eat rolls or bread by tearing off small bite-size pieces and buttering only the piece you are preparing to eat. When ready for another piece, repeat the same process. (Desiderius Erasmus, 1532)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezproxy.everettcc.edu/login?url=https://ezproxy.everettcc.edu:2060/docview/1848376163?accountid=1167|title=A Place at the Table for Good Manners|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=|website=ezproxy.everettcc.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Engage in table conversation that is pleasant but entirely free of controversial subjects. (Thomas Twyne, 1576)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#If you need something that you cannot reach easily, politely ask the person closest to the item you need to pass it to you. (Thomas Tusser, 1577)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Elbows on the table are acceptable only between courses, not while you are eating. Never chew with your mouth open or make loud noises when you eat. Although it is possible to talk with a small piece of food in your mouth, do not talk with your mouth full. If food gets caught between your teeth and you can't remove it with your tongue, leave the table and go to a mirror where you can remove the food from your teeth in private. (William Phiston, 1609)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Proper manners were a concern even of leaders in the society of eighteenth-century America –– Benjamin Franklin's  Poor Richard's Almanac, for instance, included comments on proper behavior. During the nineteenth century, hundreds of books on etiquette were published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lifelessons4u.wordpress.com/tag/history-of-manners-and-etiquette/|title=History of Manners and Etiquette {{!}} Life Lessons|website=lifelessons4u.wordpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the home ==
Each household may have a unique set of rules at the table, but despite cultural differences, there are some essential table manners most families share, including rules against picking one's teeth at the table and chewing with one's mouth open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/top-ten-table-manners/|title=Top Ten Table Manners - The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changing lifestyles, table manners are more casual than they were in the 1950s. For example, some commentators contend that the common prohibition against placing elbows on the table no longer applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mannersmentor.com/social-situations/elbows-on-the-table-have-the-manners-changed-yep|title=Elbows On the Table, Have the Manners Changed? Yes!|last=|first=|date=2014-04-24|work=Manners Mentor|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many families eat fast food without silverware and eat meals in front of the television or in the car rather than following past norms of gathering the family at the dining table for a meal. Critics claim that these changes have led to fewer opportunities to learn table manners in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/16/garden/table-manners-a-casualty-of-changing-times.html|title=TABLE MANNERS: A CASUALTY OF CHANGING TIMES|last=Greer|first=William R.|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/career-coach-table-etiquette-still-matters/2014/04/25/adf17dbe-cbbe-11e3-93eb-6c0037dde2ad_story.html|title=Career Coach: Table etiquette still matters|last=Russell|first=Joyce E.

Additionally, advancement of technology in recent years raises issues regarding [[smartphone]] use at the dining table. Opinions vary regarding whether the use of smartphones at the dining table is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4010146/smartphones-dinner/|title=Everybody Hates When You Use Your Phone at Dinner|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/23864-phones-at-the-dinner-table-u-m-study-explores-attitudes|title=Phones at the dinner table: U-M study explores attitudes {{!}} University of Michigan News|website=ns.umich.edu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offenses ==
The convention of avoiding putting one's elbows on the table while eating arose from a time when tables were sufficiently rustic and unstable that leaning on them could cause loose planks to disrupt the meal.[https://culinarylore.com/food-history:no-elbows-on-the-table/ ht]  However, as time has changed, it has become more acceptable to put one's elbows on the table, but only between courses, not while eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/top-ten-table-manners/|title=Top Ten Table Manners - The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bibim naengmyeon by roland in Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Slurping is an action that has been perceived differently by different cultures.|alt=]]
The main reason to be quiet while eating is for safety. According to the [[National Safety Council]], suffocation, especially on foods, was ranked fourth on a list of major causes of death in American homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsc.org/home-safety|title=Safety at Home|website=www.nsc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a case in an American middle school that involved one of the students choking while eating in the cafeteria.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;In most places, it is unacceptable for someone to make disapproving or disrespectful sounds when presented with food. Likewise, blowing one's nose at the table is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12557773|title=Food &amp; nutrition : customs &amp; culture|last=Paul.|first=Fieldhouse,|date=1986|publisher=Croom Helm|year=|isbn=0709910428|location=London|pages=68–69|oclc=12557773}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, slurping food is considered offensive and impolite and inconsiderate to others. For example it is illegal to slurp soup at a public eating place in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/nyregion/jersey-welcome-to-the-capital-of-wacky-laws.html|title=JERSEY; Welcome to the Capital of Wacky Laws|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=2001-07-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every good table manner in North America is acceptable in every part of the world. Certain manners are considered rude in other cultures; for example, leaving tips. It is normal for an American to leave a tip for their waiter. However, it is offensive to tip waiters in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/japanese-customs-that-are-shocking-to-foreign-travelers-2015-2|title=11 Japanese customs that are shocking to foreign travellers|last=Thrastardottir|first=Asta|date=2015-02-19|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As business dealings can take place over a meal, table manners may be put to good use while dining with clientele, co-workers, or subordinates - building rapport with a client, celebrating the accomplishments of a team, or simply hosting a discussion in a non-office setting all call for proper etiquette if dining is involved. It is deemed an essential enough behavioral skill that has suffered from a decline in naturally occurring generational inheritance&lt;ref&gt;Greer, William R. "TABLE MANNERS: A CASUALTY OF CHANGING TIMES." ''New York Times,'' Late Edition (East Coast) ed., Oct 16 1985, ''ProQuest.'' Web. 30 Apr. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; to the effect that some schools have opened programs and classes centered around dining etiquette to educate students in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title="Bad Dining Etiquette can often Hamper Your Career."|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2018|work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor table manners can affect the opinion of those involved, as well as the outcome of the meeting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Etiquette: Make a Good Impression - Gain the Competitive Edge|last=Dunckel|first=Jacqueline|publisher=International Self-Counsel Press Ltd.|year=August 1992|isbn=0-88908-531-5|location=Canada|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many appropriate mannerisms from formal dining situations can be applied in a business setting, though variations exist depending on who is the host and who is the guest, and the relation the one has with the other. Speaking while still chewing or mid-bite may be acceptable in an informal lunch setting with often-seen coworkers, but in a high-stakes meeting with a potential customer, it will likely come off as rude. [[Napkin]]s are intended to be kept in the lap. The exception is when leaving the table temporarily - placed on the chair signals the staff that the diner's meal is unfinished, placed on the table near the plate shows the patron has completed their meal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Unless the host offers to pay the inevitable bill, it should be assumed that each diner is responsible for their own bill, and the staff (and table) should be made aware of this at the appropriate time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Meier, Myka. "How to Deal with an Over-Spender Who always Wants to Split the Bill." ''The New York Observer,'' Nov 07 2017, ''ProQuest.'' Web. 30 Apr. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The former being the case typically does not mean that the most expensive item on the menu should be sought out.

The [[dress code]] for a business related dining event can vary, usually around when the event takes place. The lunch period will likely find participants wearing what they wore to work, though special events may require a higher level of dress. It is important to understand and attempt to match the formality of the event&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; - this type of table manners begin prior to sitting down at the table.

== Restaurant ==
The level of formality can vary depending on the formality of the restaurant.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Proper table manners ought to begin as soon as one arrives at a table. The very first step after sitting down is place the napkin in one's lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ala-apa.org/newsletter/2008/11/14/dining-etiquette-a-refresher-course/|title=Dining Etiquette: A Refresher Course – Library Worklife:|last=Bremer|first=Jill|date=2008|website=ala-apa.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the napkin placed on the lap, it protects clothing from spills or food that may fall into the diner's lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rootedinfoods.com/table-manners-the-napkin/|title=Table Manners: The Napkin {{!}} Rooted in Foods|last=|first=|date=2017-08-25|website=rootedinfoods.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PlaceSettingCharger.jpg|thumb|The basic place setting]]
It is important to be able to navigate the table setting, not only knowing which utensils to use, but which items are meant for whose use. A general rule of thumb for selecting the proper spoon or fork when provided with multiple is to start on the outside and work your way in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etiquettescholar.com/dining_etiquette/table_setting.html#table_setting_guide|title=The Ultimate Table Setting Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=www.etiquettescholar.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if you are starting with a salad course and you have two forks to choose from, the fork farthest from the plate should be used, leaving the closer one for the main course.  Similarly, if you start with soup, select the spoon that is farthest from the plate.

Many restaurants set the table with a bread plate and water glass at each seat before patrons arrive. The bread plate goes to the left of the plate, and the beverage to the right.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rodalewellness.com/living-well/dining-table-manners-etiquette/slide/4|title=10 Basic Table Manners Rules You Should Always Follow|last=Williams Brown|first=Kelly|date=2017-03-08|work=Rodale Wellness|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid drinking from the wrong glass or taking a bite of your neighbor's bread, use the following trick if you forget which is yours:&lt;blockquote&gt;Touch both your index fingers to your thumbs. On your left, you will see a lowercase ''b'', which stands for the bread plate. On your right is a lowercase ''d'' for Drinks.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dining in North America is widely viewed as a social occasion, rather than simply an opportunity to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/texting-at-the-dinner-table/|title=Texting at the Dinner Table - The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|last=Post Senning|first=Cindy|date=|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it is important to show the people dining with you that you respect them and their time enough to put your cell phone away.  According to a study done by the Pew Research Center, 38% percent of people think it is acceptable to use cell phones in restaurants, and that number gets even smaller depending on the occasion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/26/key-findings-about-etiquette-in-the-digital-age/|title=Manners 2.0: Key findings about etiquette in the digital age|last=Rainie|first=Lee|date=2015-08-26|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  12% of people think it is OK to use cell phones at family dinners, and only 5% think it is appropriate during meetings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

When it comes to paying the bill in American restaurants, adding a tip is a common custom that is often expected by the waiter.  According to a study by [http://CreditCards.com CreditCards.com], 4 out of 5 Americans always leave a tip when dining out, and the average tip is 16%-20% of the total bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://demographicpartitions.org/demographics-tipping-restaurants/|title=Demographics of Tipping at Restaurants - Demographic Partitions|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|work=Demographic Partitions|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|t|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|vilˈfreːdo paˈreːto|lang}}; born '''Wilfried Fritz Pareto''', 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian [[engineer]], [[sociologist]], [[economist]], political scientist, and [[philosopher]]. He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of [[income distribution]] and in the analysis of individuals' choices.  He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term "[[elite]]" in social analysis.

He introduced the concept of [[Pareto efficiency]] and helped develop the field of [[microeconomics]]. He was also the first to discover that [[income]] follows a [[Pareto distribution]], which is a [[power law]] probability distribution. The [[Pareto principle]] was named after him, and it was built on observations of his such as that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by about 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of [[sociology]] and [[mathematics]], according to the mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and Richard L. Hudson:

{{quote|His legacy as an economist was profound. Partly because of him, the field evolved from a branch of moral philosophy as practised by [[Adam Smith]] into a data intensive field of scientific research and mathematical equations.  His books look more like modern economics than most other texts of that day: tables of statistics from across the world and ages, rows of integral signs and equations, intricate charts and graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoit |authorlink =Benoit Mandelbrot|author2=Richard L Hudson  |title=The (mis)behavior of markets : a fractal view of risk, ruin, and reward |year=2004 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |page=153|isbn=0465043577}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Biography==
Pareto was born of an exiled noble [[Genoa|Genoese]] family in 1848 in Paris, the centre of the popular revolutions of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812–1882), was an Italian civil engineer and [[Liguria]]n marquis who had left Italy much like [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and other Italian nationalists.&lt;ref name=Amoroso&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amoroso|first=Luigi|title=Vilfredo Pareto|journal=Econometrica|date=January 1938|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–21|jstor=1910081|doi=10.2307/1910081}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 German revolution]], his parents named him Fritz Wilfried, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family's move back to Italy in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Suntum |first=Ulrich |title=The Invisible Hand |isbn=3-540-20497-0 |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education, attending the new created ''Istituto Tecnico Leardi'' where  Fernando Pio Rosellini was his mathematics professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Giacalone-Monaco|first= Tommaso|title= Ricerche intorno alla giovinezza di Vilfredo Pareto|jstor=23239355|language= it|journal= Giornale degli Economisti e Annali di Economia|volume= 25|issue= 1/2|year= 1966|pages= 97–104|issn= 0017-0097}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he earned a doctor's degree in engineering from what is now the [[Politecnico di Torino|Polytechnic University of Turin]]&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt; (then the Technical School for Engineers). His dissertation was entitled "The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies". His later interest in equilibrium analysis in [[Economic equilibrium|economics]] and [[Social equilibrium|sociology]] can be traced back to this paper.

===From civil engineer to classical liberal economist===
For some years after graduation, he worked as a [[civil engineer]], first for the state-owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry. He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works.&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt;

He did not begin serious work in economics until his mid-forties. He started his career a fiery advocate of [[classical liberalism]], besting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the [[free market]]. In 1886, he became a lecturer on [[economics]] and [[management]] at the [[University of Florence]]. His stay in [[Florence]] was marked by political activity, much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle, quitting his job and marrying a Russian, Alessandrina Bakunina. She left him in 1902 for a young servant.

===Economics and sociology===
In 1893, he succeeded [[Léon Walras]] to the chair of Political Economy at the [[University of Lausanne]]&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt; in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1906, he made the famous observation that twenty percent of the population owned eighty percent of the property in Italy, later generalised by [[Joseph M. Juran]] into the [[Pareto principle]] (also termed the [[80–20 rule]]). In one of his books published in 1909 he showed the [[Pareto distribution]] of how wealth is distributed, he believed "through any human society, in any age, or country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoit |author2=Richard L Hudson  |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets :A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |year=2004 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists, but always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed. He later became suspicious of their humanitarian motives and denounced socialist leaders as an 'aristocracy of brigands' who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of [[Giovanni Giolitti]] for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes. Growing unrest among labor in Italy led him to the anti-socialist and anti-democratic camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03085149000000016|author=Bellamy, Richard |year=1990|title=From Ethical to Economic Liberalism – The Sociology of Pareto's Politics|journal=Economy and Society|volume=19|issue=4|pages=431–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude toward [[fascism]] in his last years is a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name="RenatoCirillo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Was Vilfredo Pareto Really a 'Precursor' of Fascism?|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=42|issue=2|pages=235|jstor=3486644|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1983.tb01708.x|quote=Vilfredo Pareto has been labeled a fascist and 'a precursor of fascism' largely because he welcomed the advent of fascism in Italy and was honored by the new regime. Some have seen in his sociological  works the foundations of fascism. This is not correct. Even fascist writers did not find much merit in these works, and definitely condemned his economic theories. As a political thinker he remained a radical libertarian till the end, and continued to express serious reservations about fascism, and to voice opposition to its basic policies. This is evident from his correspondence with his close friends. There are strong reasons to believe that, had he lived long enough, Pareto would have revolted against fascism|year=1983|last1=Cirillo|first1=Renato}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Four Paretos of Raymond Aron|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=47|issue=2|pages=287|jstor=2709815|doi=10.2307/2709815 |year=1986|last1=Campbell|first1=Stuart L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto's relationship with scientific sociology in the age of the foundation is grafted in a paradigmatic way in the moment in which he, starting from the political economy, criticizes positivism as a totalizing and metaphysical system devoid of a rigorous logical-experimental method. In this sense we can read the fate of the
Paretian production within a history of the social sciences that continues to show its peculiarity and interest for its contributions in the 21st century (Giovanni Busino, ''Sugli studi paretiani all'alba del XXI secolo'' in ''Omaggio a Vilfredo Pareto'', ''Numero monografico in memoria di Giorgio Sola'' a cura di Stefano Monti Bragadin, "Storia Politica Società", Quaderni di Scienze Umane, anno IX, n. 15, giugno-dicembre 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;1 e sg.)) . The story of Pareto is also part of the multidisciplinary research of a scientific model that privileges sociology as a critique of cumulative models of knowledge as well as a discipline tending to the affirmation of relational models of science (Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Vilfredo Pareto e i modelli interdisciplinari nella scienza,'' "Sociologia", A. XXIX, n. 1, New Series, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;2017–222 see also in Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Una epistemologia senza storia'', Rome, New Culture, 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–29, {{ISBN|978-88-6812-222-5}}).

===Personal life===
In 1923 Pareto remarried with Jeanne Regis, just before he died in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, 19 August 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statprob.com/encyclopedia/VilfredoFederigoSamasoPARETO.html |title=The Encyclopedia Sponsored by Statistics and Probability Societies |publisher=StatProb |date=19 August 1923 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204438/http://statprob.com/encyclopedia/VilfredoFederigoSamasoPARETO.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "among a menagerie of cats that he and his French lover kept" in their villa; "the local divorce laws prevented him from divorcing his wife and remarrying until just a few months prior to his death".

==Sociology==
Pareto's later years were spent in collecting the material for his best-known work, ''Trattato di sociologia generale'' (1916) (''The Mind and Society'', published in 1935). His final work was ''Compendio di sociologia generale'' (1920).

In his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916, rev. French trans. 1917), published in English by [[Harcourt, Brace]] in a four-volume edition edited by [[Arthur Livingston]] under the title ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1935), Pareto developed the notion of the [[circulation of elite]]s, the first [[social cycle theory]] in sociology. He is famous for saying "history is a graveyard of aristocracies".&lt;ref&gt;Rossides, Daniel W. (1998) ''Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p. 203. {{ISBN|1882289501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto seems to have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his abstract mathematical economic theories did not work out in practice, in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened. His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non-rational actions. We are driven, he taught, by certain "residues" and by "derivations" from these residues. The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk-taking, and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite, which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the "foxes" or speculators. A catastrophe results, with a return to conservatism; the "lion" mentality follows. This cycle might be broken by the use of force, says Pareto, but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, Raymond. (1967) ''Main Currents in Sociological Thought: Durkheim, Pareto, Weber – Vol. 2''  [https://www.questia.com/read/100306508 online edition]; [https://www.amazon.com/Main-Currents-Sociological-Thought-Durkheim/dp/0765804360/  excerpt and text search]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto's sociology was introduced to the United States by [[George C. Homans|George Homans]] and [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson|Lawrence J. Henderson]] at Harvard, and had considerable influence, especially on Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the status quo is usually functional.&lt;ref&gt;Homans, George C., and Charles P. Curtis Jr. (1934) [https://www.questia.com/read/80982212 ''An Introduction to Pareto: His Sociology'']. Alfred A. Knopf. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto was a lifelong [[Anti-Marxism|opponent of Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jkalb.freeshell.org/misc/pareto.html |title=Vilfredo Pareto – An Overview |publisher=Jkalb.freeshell.org |date= |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism and power distribution==
[[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote:

{{quote|One of Pareto's equations achieved special prominence, and controversy. He was fascinated by problems of power and wealth. How do people get it? How is it distributed around society? How do those who have it use it? The gulf between rich and poor has always been part of the human condition, but Pareto resolved to measure it. He gathered reams of data on wealth and income through different centuries, through different countries: the tax records of Basel, Switzerland, from 1454 and from Augsburg, Germany, in 1471, 1498 and 1512; contemporary rental income from Paris; personal income from Britain, Prussia, Saxony, Ireland, Italy, Peru. What he found – or thought he found – was striking. When he plotted the data on graph paper, with income on one axis, and number of people with that income on the other, he saw the same picture nearly everywhere in every era. Society was not a "social pyramid" with the proportion of rich to poor sloping gently from one class to the next. Instead it was more of a "social arrow" – very fat on the bottom where the mass of men live, and very thin at the top where sit the wealthy elite.  Nor was this effect by chance; the data did not remotely fit a bell curve, as one would expect if wealth were distributed randomly. "It is a social law", he wrote: something "in the nature of man".&lt;ref name=mandelbrot&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît  |authorlink= Benoît Mandelbrot|title=The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |publisher=Basic Books|date=2006 |pages=|chapter=Τhe Mystery of Cotton |isbn=978-0465043576}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}}}}

Pareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled. For this reason he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the "pure" economic forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Political Ideologies |last=Eatwell |first=Roger |author2=Anthony Wright  |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=1999 |pages=38–39|isbn=082645173X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandelbrot summarized Pareto's notions as follows:

{{quote|At the bottom of the Wealth curve, he wrote, Men and Women starve and children die young. In the broad middle of the curve all is turmoil and motion: people rising and falling, climbing by talent or luck and falling by alcoholism, tuberculosis and other kinds of unfitness. At the very top sit the elite of the elite, who control wealth and power for a time – until they are unseated through revolution or upheaval by a new aristocratic class. There is no progress in human history. Democracy is a fraud. Human nature is primitive, emotional, unyielding. The smarter, abler, stronger, and shrewder take the lion's share. The weak starve, lest society become degenerate: One can, Pareto wrote, 'compare the social body to the human body, which will promptly perish if prevented from eliminating toxins.' Inflammatory stuff – and it burned Pareto's reputation.&lt;ref name=mandelbrot/&gt;{{rp|154}}}}

The future leader of [[Italian fascism]] [[Benito Mussolini]], in 1904, when he was a young student, attended some of Pareto's lectures at the [[University of Lausanne]]. It has been argued that Mussolini's move away from [[socialism]] towards a form of "[[elitism]]" may be attributed to Pareto's ideas.&lt;ref name=musso&gt;{{cite book |last= |first=|editor-last1=Di Scala |editor-first1=Spencer M. |editor-last2=Gentile|editor-first2= Emilio|title=Mussolini 1883-1915: Triumph and Transformation of a Revolutionary Socialist |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=USA|date=2016 |pages=|chapter= |isbn=978-1-137-53486-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote [[Franz Borkenau]], a biographer:
{{quote|In the first years of his rule Mussolini literally executed the policy prescribed by Pareto, destroying political liberalism, but at the same time largely replacing state management of private enterprise, diminishing taxes on property, favoring industrial development, imposing a religious education in dogmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borkenau |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Borkenau |title=Pareto |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1936 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}}}

[[Karl Popper]] dubbed Pareto the "theoretician of totalitarianism",&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, Benoit; Richard L Hudson (2004). ''The (mis)behavior of markets : a fractal view of risk, ruin, and reward.'' New York: Basic Books. pp. 152–155. {{ISBN|0465043577}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Cirillo, there is no evidence in Popper's published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgment in anti-fascist circles.&lt;ref name="RenatoCirillo"/&gt;

Some fascist writers, such as [[Luigi Amoroso]], wrote approvingly of Pareto's ideas:
{{quote|Just as the weaknesses of the flesh delayed, but could not prevent, the triumph of [[Saint Augustine]], so a [[rational]]istic vocation retarded but did not impede the flowering of the [[mysticism]] of Pareto. For that reason, Fascism, having become victorious, extolled him in life, and glorifies his memory, like that of a confessor of its faith.&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt;}}

Author  Renato Cirillo argued, on the contrary, that:
{{quote|Some have seen in [Pareto's] sociological works the foundations of fascism. This is not correct. Even fascist writers did not find much merit in these works, and definitely condemned his economic theories.&lt;ref name="RenatoCirillo" /&gt;}}

== Economic concepts ==

'''Pareto Theory Of Maximum Economics'''

Pareto turned his interest to economic matters and he became an advocate of free trade, finding himself in difficulty with the Italian government. His writings reflected the ideas of [[Léon Walras]] that economics is essentially a mathematical science. Pareto was a leader of the "[[Lausanne School]]" and represents the second generation of the [[Neoclassical Revolution]].  His "tastes-and-obstacles" approach to [[general equilibrium theory]] was resurrected during the great "Paretian Revival" of the 1930s and has influenced theoretical economics since.&lt;ref&gt;Cirillo, Renato (1978) ''The Economics of Vilfredo Pareto''&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Manual of Political Economy'' (1906) the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of "objectives and constraints".  He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth (1881) extensively, for the theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer. He gave the first presentation of the trade-off box now known as the "Edgeworth-Bowley" box.&lt;ref&gt;Mclure, Michael (2001) [https://www.questia.com/read/102813057 ''Pareto, Economics and Society: The Mechanical Analogy''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility&lt;ref name=Aspers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aspers|first=Patrik|title=Crossing the Boundary of Economics and Sociology: The Case of Vilfredo Pareto|journal=The American Journal of Economics and Sociology|date=April 2001|volume=60|issue=2|pages=519–45|jstor=3487932|doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00073}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that, only that he preferred X of this to Y of that. Utility was a preference-ordering.  With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics, but he also demolished the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy (which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number; Pareto said "good" cannot be measured). He replaced it with the notion of ''[[Pareto efficiency|Pareto-optimality]]'', the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.  Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory. A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00220485.1991.10844705|jstor=1182422|title=How Well Do We Know Pareto Optimality?|journal=The Journal of Economic Education|volume=22|issue=2|pages=172|year=2014|last1=Mathur|first1=Vijay K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts===
Some economic concepts in current use are based on his work:
* The [[Pareto index]] is a measure of the inequality of income distribution.
He argued that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth.   He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern:
#  &lt;math&gt;\log N = \log A + m \log x&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of people with wealth higher than x, and A and m are constants.  Over the years, Pareto's Law has proved remarkably close to observed data.
* The [[Pareto chart]] is a special type of [[histogram]], used to view causes of a problem in order of severity from largest to smallest. It is a statistical tool that graphically demonstrates the Pareto principle or the 80–20 rule.
* [[Pareto principle|Pareto's law]] concerns the distribution of income.
* The [[Pareto distribution]] is a [[probability distribution]] used, among other things, as a mathematical realization of Pareto's law.
* [[Ophelimity]] is a measure of purely economic satisfaction.

'''Westley Wallace Law''' (January 1, 1923 &amp;ndash; July 29, 2002) was a civil rights leader from [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He was president of the Savannah chapter of the [[NAACP]], where he led his community and made  great strides in desegregation through [[nonviolent resistance]] from 1950 to 1976. After his time with the NAACP W. W. Law spent much of the rest of his life advocating for African-American history and culture in Savannah. To this end he established the Savannah-Yamacraw Branch of the [[Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History]], the [[Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum]], the [[King-Tisdell Cottage Museum]], the [[Beach Institute of African American Culture]], and the [[Negro Heritage Trail Tour]].

==Background==

W. W. Law was the only son and eldest of ten children born to Geneva Wallace and Westley Law. He began working at the age of ten to help his recently widowed mother while also attending school. In high school, Law joined the NAACP Youth Council and later served as the council's president while in college at [[Savannah State University|Georgia State College]]. His college career was interrupted when he was drafted into military service in [[World War II]]. W. W. Law returned from the war and, with the help of the GI Bill, returned to college where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology.

After graduation Law worked as a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service for more than forty years. His job with the Postal Service was endangered, however, when he was fired for his civil rights activism. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and the NAACP stepped in quickly upon hearing of Law's firing and he was reinstated in his job. Mr. Law retired from the Postal Service in 1990. Westley Wallace Law died on July 29, 2002 at his home in Savannah,Georgia.

The '''White Racial Identity Model''' was developed by psychologist [[Janet E. Helms|Janet Helms]] in 1990. It is a racial and [[Ethnic identity development|ethnic identity model]] created specifically for people who identify as [[White people|White]]. This theory, heavily influenced by [[William E. Cross Jr.|William Cross]], has become a widely referenced and studied theory on white [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]] development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Patton, L. D., Renn, K. A., Guido, F. M., Quaye, S. J., Evans, N. J., &amp; Forney, D. S. (2016). ''Student development in college: Theory, research, and practice''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.
&lt;/ref&gt; This model was created “to raise the awareness of White people about their role in creating and maintaining a racist society, and the need for them to act responsibly by dismantling [[systemic racism]] through a framework of power and [[White Privilege|privilege]],”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Helms, J. E. (1995). An update of Helms's white and people of color racial identity models. In J.G. Ponterotto, J.M. Casas, L.A. Suzuki, &amp; C.M. Alexander (Eds.), ''Handbook of multicultural counseling'' (pp. 181-198). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Helms presented the idea that all people have a racial identity in some way that is influenced by power and privilege.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Two sequential phases ==
The White Racial Identity Model is broken into five stages, split into two groups: Abandonment of [[Racism]] and the Evolution of a non-racist identity. White individuals transition from understanding themselves as racial beings and the privilege associated with being White, to taking ownership of and abandoning racial privilege, and finally learning about other racial groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In phase one, the abandonment of racism, White identifying individuals have no consciousness of their race and privilege until they are met with a disruption related to race. This disruption then challenges the individual’s ideas of whiteness and how they play a role in a racist society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following this encounter, the individual then begins to understand the salience of race and its relevance to power. In this stage, a person moves through three other sub-stages: Contact, Disintegration, and Reintegration.

Once an individual has experienced phase one, they move to phase two, the evolution of a non-racist identity, where they begin to reflect more seriously on their identity and how they interact with their surroundings. They begin to make more efforts to interact and learn from different racial groups. Helms wrote that people in this phase are working to “be White without also being bad, evil, or racist”. The stages a person moves through in this phase includes Pseudo-independence, Immersion/Emersion, and Autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, J.E. (1992). ''A race is a nice thing to have: A guide to being a white person or ''understanding the white persons in your life''. Topeka, KS: Content Communications. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and measurement ==
The White Racial Identity Model has been measured using the White Racial Identity Attitudes Scale (WRIAS) developed originally in 1990 by Helms and Carter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Leach, M. M., Behrens, J. T., &amp; LaFleur, N. K. (2002). White Racial Identity and White Racial Consciousness: Similarities, Differences, and Recommendations. ''Journal Of Multicultural Counseling &amp; Development'', ''30''(2), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Helms has said that this scale can be used to quantify the “multidimensional aspect” of the identity statues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although this scale has been critiqued{{by whom|date=March 2018}}, it has been replicated in several studies and the scales in this measure are highly correlated in measuring this construct.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Helms and Cook, however, recommend using qualitative analysis in conjunction with the WRIAS to develop a racial profile for these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, J.E. &amp; Cook, D.A. (1999). ''Using race and culture in counseling and psychotherapy: Theory and process.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Critiques ==
One of the main critiques of this model is that it is outdated and not as applicable as it once was.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The theory was created in 1990 and revised in 1995. Although it has been updated, there are many other white identity development and consciousness models that have been adapted from this that some researchers and practitioners see as more relevant.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Wayne|last2=Bennett|first2=Sandra K.|last3=Atkinson|first3=Donald R.|title=White Racial Identity Models|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011000094221009|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=129–146|doi=10.1177/0011000094221009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Row, Bennett, and Atkinson created their own theory in response to concerns they had with Helm’s model. These critiques included the singular focus on blacks and the white-black relationship, the developmental stage focus of the model, and the similarities to [[Ethnic identity development|ethnic identity models]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They created the White Racial Consciousness Theory to address these concerns.

The '''Women's International League for Peace and Freedom''' ('''WILPF''') is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization]] working "to bring together women of different political views and philosophical and religious backgrounds determined to study and make known the causes of [[war]] and work for a [[perpetual peace|permanent peace]]" and to unite women worldwide who oppose [[oppression]] and [[Sexism|exploitation]]. WILPF has national sections in 37 countries.

The WILPF is headquartered in [[Geneva]] and maintains a [[United Nations]] office in [[New York City]].

Furthermore, Women’s international league for peace and freedom opposed to wars and international conflicts. Since it is an undeniable fact that wars will violate individual’s peace and freedom, the league organised and took formal actions to end the war. The major movements of the league are open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, International day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and statement on weapons, [[gender-based violence]] and women [[human rights defender]]s. As the league is consisted of women, concentrated professionals are allowed to improve the current issues related to women and people. 

===Woman's Peace Party (USA)===
{{Main article|Woman's Peace Party}}
A forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in [[Washington, D.C.]] at a meeting called by [[Jane Addams]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] to offer continuous [[mediation]] as a way of ending war.

WPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28–30, 1915.

===International Congress of Women, The Hague, 1915===
The [[Women at the Hague|1915 International Congress of Women]] was organized by the [[German people|German]] [[feminism|feminist]] [[Anita Augspurg]], Germany's first female [[jurist]], and [[Lida Gustava Heymann]] (1868–1943) at the invitation of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[pacifist]], feminist and [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] [[Aletta Jacobs]] to protest the [[World War I|war]] then raging in [[Europe]], and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Congress of Women opens at The Hague|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/international-congress-of-women-opens-at-the-hague|website=History.Doc|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wound up on May 1,&lt;ref name=1915Hague&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36546779/The_Women_Who_Tried_to_Stop_the_Great_War_The_International_Congress_of_Women_at_The_Hague_1915 The Women Who Tried to Stop the Great War: The International Congress of Women at The Hague 1915], In A. H. Campbell (Ed.), Global Leadership Initiatives for Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding (pp. 249-266). (Ch.12) Hershey, PA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and [[non-belligerent|belligerent]] [[nation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Veen|first1=Sietske|title=Hirschmann, Susanna Theodora Cornelia (1871-1957)|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|website=Huygens ING|publisher=Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands|accessdate=30 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830163944/http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|archivedate=30 August 2017|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an '''International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace''' (ICWPP) with [[Jane Addams]] as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP.

===Second International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, Zürich, 1919===
[[Jane Addams]] met with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in [[Zürich]] in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|peace treaty]] ending World War I as a scheme of [[revenge]] of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another [[world war]]. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the '''Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.'''&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt; WILPF moved its headquarters to [[Geneva]] to be near the proposed site of the [[League of Nations]], although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food [[blockade]]s or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism.&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt; The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as "unpatriotic" during the [[First Red Scare]].&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt; The WILPF supported treaties such as the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order.&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt;

During the 1930s, [[Vera Brittain]] was the WILPF's Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Deane |title=History in our hands: a critical anthology of writings on literature, culture, and politics from the 1930s |location=London |publisher=Leicester University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7185-0143-3 |pages=63–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's [[Jews|Jewish]] community.&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt;

Although WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including [[Bart de Ligt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bart |last=de Ligt |title=The Intellectual Class and Modern Warfare |magazine=Reconciliation |date=July 1929 }} (Speech originally given at WIPLF conference in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.

Bernal: a life in science and politics |location=London |publisher=Verso |year=1999 |isbn=1-85984-854-0 |page=234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two WILPF leaders have received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: [[Jane Addams]], in 1931 and [[Emily Greene Balch]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/female-activists-hague-new-peace-agenda-1915-congress-of-women|title = Centenary Stand: Female Activists Head for The Hague to Set a New Peace Agenda|last = Ford|first = Liz|date = 27 April 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 8 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WILPF and the United Nations===
WILPF has had [[Consultative Status]] (category B) with the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the [[democratization]] of the UN, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the [[privatisation]] and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council [[veto#United Nations|veto]].

==WILPF today==

===Positions===
WILPF envisions a world free of [[violence]], [[poverty]], [[pollution]] and dominance. WILPF stands for [[Social equality|equality]] of all people in a world free of [[racism]], [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]]; the building of a constructive peace through world [[arms control|disarmament]]; and the changing of government priorities to meet human needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilpfinternational.org/AboutUs/index.htm#aims]&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad areas of concern are:
*[[Disarmament]], [[Demilitarisation]] and [[Good governance]]
*[[Environmental sustainability]]
*Global [[Economic justice|Economic Justice]]

{{Discrimination sidebar}}{{Feminism sidebar}}
A '''women-only space''' is an area where only women are allowed, thus providing a place where they do not have to interact with men. Historically and globally, many cultures had, and many still have, some form of female seclusion.

==Purpose and background==
Women-only spaces are a form of [[sex segregation]], and practices such as women-only [[public toilet]]s, [[women-only passenger car]]s on public transport or [[women's parking space]]s may be described using both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browne|first=Kath|title=Genderism and the Bathroom Problem: (re)materialising sexed sites, (re)creating sexed bodies|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography|date=Sep 2004|volume=11|issue=3|pages=331–346|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=14573951&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=10 May 2014|doi=10.1080/0966369042000258668}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes referred to as "[[safe space]]". The goal is to provide women an area to work, free of male judgment or harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=HRCA&amp;u=lom_nmichu&amp;id=GALE%7CA445288645&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=lom_nmichu&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These spaces do not go without challenge. [[Men's rights]] activists have launched lawsuits to gain access to female-only spaces, as for example ''[[Stopps v Just Ladies Fitness (Metrotown) Ltd]]'', regarding a gym in Canada. The access of [[trans woman|trans women]], with or without legal recognition of their acquired gender, is also sometimes contentious, both from an ethical and from a legal perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juliaserano.com/outside.html |title=On the Outside Looking In  |author=Julia Serano |authorlink=Julia Serano |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2012/05/legalities_of_e |title=Legalities of excluding trans women from women only spaces |author=Julian Norman |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Mary|title=FEMINIST SPIRITUALITY AND GENDER Lessons From Beyond Women-Only Space|journal=Communities|date=2014|volume=162|pages=38–72|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=94890559&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases questions have been raised about the value and legitimacy of particular spaces being reserved for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/07/feminist-troublemaker-film-festival |title=So I'm a feminist troublemaker for requesting some women-only space? |author=Julia Long |date=2012-12-07 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's quarters and segregated societies ==
Many cultures have had a tradition of separate living space for the women of a household ("women's quarters"); this becomes more elaborate the larger the house is, reaching its peak in royal palaces. The best known example is probably the [[harem]], a Turkish word, but similar systems existed elsewhere, and still do, in some places.
*[[Andaruni]] (Iran)
*[[Seraglio]] (Ottoman Empire)
*[[Zenana]] (South Asia) - hence, [[Zenana missions]], providing medical and educational support to segregated women
*[[Purdah]] (South Asia)
*[[Terem (Russia)|Terem]] (Russia)
*[[Ōoku]] (Japan)

Some societies segregate most public facilities by sex, according to their interpretation of [[Islam and gender segregation]]; critics calls this [[gender apartheid]] after the former South African system of racial division. The best known examples are Saudi Arabia ([[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia#Sex segregation]]) and Iran ([[Sex segregation in Iran]], [[Women's rights in Iran]]). More disputed regimes include Afghanistan ([[Taliban treatment of women]]) and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

==History==
In English-speaking societies, the rise of [[first wave feminism]], including the long struggles for the vote ([[suffrage]]) and for access to education and the professions, led to various initiatives to widen women's possibilities.
* A [[Ladies' Ordinary|ladies' ordinary]] was a women-only dining space which started to appear in North American hotels and restaurants from 1830, when it was socially unacceptable for women to dine in public without a male escort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Paul|date=2014-09-01|title=Women and Restaurants in the Nineteenth-Century United States|url=https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article-abstract/48/1/1/947457/Women-and-Restaurants-in-the-Nineteenth-Century|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1093/jsh/shu042|issn=0022-4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1910s and 1920s, there was widespread encouragement in the United States for the establishment of ladies' lounges and rest rooms to accommodate rural women who traveled into county seats and market towns to conduct business. The [[Ladies Rest Room]] in Lewisburg, Tennessee, may be the last free-standing one in that state still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ladies Rest Room: correspondence 2 :: Southern Places|url=http://digital.mtsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15838coll4/id/2591/rec/1|website=digital.mtsu.edu|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1929 [[Virginia Woolf]] published an influential essay entitled "[[A Room of One's Own]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fth.sagepub.com/content/17/1/43.full.pdf+html|title=Because They're Worth It! Making Room for Female Students and Thealogy in Higher Education Contexts|last=|first=|date=|website=fth.sagepub.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some of these allow men at certain times of the day, week, or year, for example as guests. Other establishments allow men and women into physically separate areas. Others exist only temporarily, renting space for a few hours or days. Some of these allow children, either only girls or both sexes.

===Toilets===
{{Main|Sex segregation in public restrooms}}

In almost all countries, [[public toilet]]s are segregated by sex.

===Places to wash===
[[File:Fourneau St-Michel - Lavoir (Saint-Remy).jpg|thumb|A restored ''lavoir'' in Belgium]]
Public nudity is in many cultures restricted to single-sex groups. So [[public baths]] may separate men and women by time or by space.
*[[Turkish bath]], ''hammam'', see especially its [[Turkish bath#Function: gendered social space|function as a gendered social space]]
*[[Mikveh]], the [[ritual washing in Judaism|Jewish ritual bath]]

Specific examples include:
*[[Frauenbad Stadthausquai]], a public bath built in Switzerland in the late 19th century for women, and which still operates as such
*[[Hampstead Ponds|Hampstead Heath Ladies' Pond]], a reservoir in a London park

In many cultures, laundry was seen as "women's work", so the village wash-house (''[[lavoir]]'') acted as a space for women to gather and talk together as they washed clothes.

===Changing rooms===
{{Main|Changing rooms}}

Places to change one's clothes, for example for leisure (at the gym, swimming pool, or beach), or for work (locker rooms at factories and hospitals), or while shopping (department store fitting rooms), are usually single-sex. Some have individual cubicles, while others provide only communal facilities, e.g. an open space with benches and lockers.

===Menstruation===
{{See also|Culture and menstruation}}
Some [[menstrual taboo]]s require a woman to stay at home, or avoid certain places such as temples, but other cultures assign a particular place to segregate herself from her community, for example the ''[[chhaupadi]]'' (menstrual huts) of Nepal today, or ''[[The Red Tent (Diamant novel)|The Red Tent]]'', a fictionalised version of Old Testament-era customs.  The anthropologist Wynne Maggi describes the communal ''bashali'' (large menstrual house) of women in the [[Kalasha Valley]] (northwestern Pakistan) as their 'most holy place', respected by men and serving as women's all-female organizing centre for establishing and maintaining gender solidarity and power.&lt;ref&gt;W. Maggi, 2001. ''Our Women are Free. Gender and Ethnicity in the Hindukush.''  Michigan: University of Michigan Press &lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[seclusion of girls at puberty]] (i.e. [[menarche]]) is another such custom.

===Motherhood and lactation===
The [[lactation room]] is a modern, mostly American phenomenon, designed for using electric [[breast pump]]s and refrigerating the expressed milk. In many countries, spaces for women to nurse their babies can be known as breastfeeding rooms or nursing areas. The period of [[postpartum confinement]] was traditionally a time for new mothers to learn to care for their infant from older and more experienced women.

===Land and shelter===
[[File:Famille.jpg|thumb|A family outside their hut in Umoja village]]
* [[Womyn's land]], stemming from [[separatist feminism]] of the 1970s
* Anti-war activism such as [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]] in the UK and [[Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice]] in the US
* [[Umoja, Kenya]], a village of women and children fleeing domestic violence
* [[JINWAR]], Syria, a village for women without a husband and their children
* [[Women's shelter]], a place of temporary accommodation for women fleeing domestic violence, e.g. [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]]
* Some [[homeless shelters]] are just for women, e.g. [[Rosie's Place]]
* Most [[rape crisis center]]s

===Education===
* Girls' schools, i.e. [[single-sex education]], see also [[:Category:Girls' schools]]
* [[Women's college]]s and universities
* [[Finishing school]]
*[[Fraternities and sororities|Sororities]]

When formal education was banned by the Taliban, underground schools sprung up, such as the [[Golden Needle Sewing School]] for writers to secretly discuss their work.

===Religious places===
* [[Women's mosques]] in China, and more generally [[Gender segregation and Muslims#Sex segregation in mosques|the women's space in most mosques]], see [[Mosque#Gender separation|Gender separation in mosques]]
*[[Gender separation in Judaism]], as for example the [[Mechitza]] used to demarcate women's space in a synagogue
*[[Convent]], the home of Christian nuns
*[[Double monastery]], with separate space for monks (men) and nuns (women)
*[[Beguinage]], all-women accommodation in the Low Countries

===Health care===
Historically, some health care services for women (particularly around childbirth) were staffed by women. As women gained increased access to education in the late nineteenth century, hospitals hired female physicians for female patients; nurses by this point were almost exclusively female.
*[[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital]] is named after one of Britain's first female physicians
*[[London School of Medicine for Women]], the first medical school to train women as doctors

During [[second-wave feminism]], health activists set up [[feminist health centers]], particularly in the United States. Some places are for women from one background, such as the [[Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center]]. Some holistic care centres are for mothers and their children, such as [[Nkosi's Haven]] in South Africa.

===Businesses and services===
* [[Women-only bank]]
**See also the [[kitty party]], an informal savings club
* [[Women's parking space]]
* [[Women-only passenger car]]

WM relies more on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas maintaining information in mind but not manipulating it [as long as the number of items is not huge (suprathreshold)] does not need involvement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (D’Esposito et al. 1999, Eldreth et al. 2006, Smith &amp; Jonides 1999).

== History ==
The term "working memory" was coined by [[George Armitage Miller|Miller]], [[Eugene Galanter|Galanter]], and [[Karl H. Pribram|Pribram]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-03-010075-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pribram, Karl H. |author2=Miller, George A. |author3=Galanter, Eugene |title=Plans and the structure of behavior |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |year=1960 |pages=65 |isbn=978-0-03-010075-8 |oclc=190675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Baddeley A |title=Working memory: looking back and looking forward |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=829–39 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14523382 |doi=10.1038/nrn1201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in the 1960s in the context of theories that likened the mind to a computer. In 1968, [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model|Atkinson and Shiffrin]]&lt;ref name="Atkinson Shiffrin 1968"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Atkinson    | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shiffrin | first2 = R.M.  | title = Human Memory: A Proposed System and its Control Processes | volume = 2 |pages = 89–195| editor1 = Kenneth W Spence |editor2= Janet T Spence | work = The psychology of learning and motivation | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1968 | isbn = 978-0-12-543302-0 |oclc = 185468704 |doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60422-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term to describe their "short-term store". What we now call working memory was formerly referred to variously as a "short-term store" or [[short-term memory]], primary memory, immediate memory, operant memory, and provisional memory.&lt;ref name="Fuster 1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fuster, Joaquin M. |title=The prefrontal cortex: anatomy, physiology, and neuropsychology of the frontal lobe |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |location=Philadelphia |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=978-0-397-51849-4 |oclc=807338522 |accessdate=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term memory is the ability to remember information over a brief period (in the order of seconds). Most theorists today use the concept of working memory to replace or include the older concept of short-term memory, marking a stronger emphasis on the notion of manipulating information rather than mere maintenance.

The earliest mention of experiments on the neural basis of working memory can be traced back to more than 100 years ago, when [[Eduard Hitzig|Hitzig]] and [[David Ferrier|Ferrier]] described [[ablation]] experiments of the [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC); they concluded that the frontal cortex was important for cognitive rather than sensory processes.&lt;ref name=Fuster1&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Fuster|first1= Joaquin |title= The prefrontal cortex |page= 126 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zuZlvNICdhUC&amp;pg=PT140&amp;dq=%22different+investigators,+the+variability+of%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22different%20investigators%2C%20the%20variability%20of%22 |edition= 4 |year= 2008 |publisher= Elsevier |location= Oxford, UK |isbn= 978-0-12-373644-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 and 1936, Carlyle Jacobsen and colleagues were the first to show the deleterious effect of prefrontal ablation on delayed response.&lt;ref name=Fuster1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benton&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Benton|first1= A.&amp;nbsp;L.|editor1-first= Harvey,&amp;nbsp;S.|editor1-last= Levin|editor2-first= Howard,&amp;nbsp;M.|editor2-last= Eisenberg|editor3-first= Arthur,&amp;nbsp;L.|editor3-last= Benton|title= Frontal lobe function and dysfunction|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=9b1htO0V0rwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Jacobsen++prefrontal+ablation&amp;q=Jacobsen%20%20prefrontal%20ablation|year= 1991|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-19-506284-7|page= 19|chapter= The prefrontal region:Its early history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Numerous models have been proposed for how working memory functions, both anatomically and cognitively. Of those, the two that have been most influential are summarized below.

=== The multicomponent model ===
{{Main|Baddeley's model of working memory}}
[[File:Baddeley and Hitch's Working Memory Model.png|thumb|300px|Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory]]

In 1974, [[Alan Baddeley|Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch|Hitch]]&lt;ref name="Baddeley Hitch 1974"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Baddeley    | first1 = Alan D.  | last2 = Hitch | first2 = Graham  | title = Working Memory | volume = 2 | editor = Gordon H. Bower | work = The psychology of learning and motivation | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1974 | pages = 47–89 | isbn = 978-0-12-543308-2 |oclc = 777285348 |doi= 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|multicomponent model of working memory]]. The theory proposed a model containing three components: the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuospatial sketchpad with the central executive functioning as a control center of sorts, directing info between the phonological and visuospatial components.&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Working Memory : Capacity, Developments and Improvement Techniques|last = Levin|first = E.S.|publisher = [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Central executive|central executive]] is responsible ''inter alia'' for directing [[attention]] to relevant information, suppressing irrelevant information and inappropriate actions, and coordinating cognitive processes when more than one task is simultaneously performed. A "central executive" is responsible for supervising the integration of information and for coordinating "slave systems" that are responsible for the short-term maintenance of information. One slave system, the [[phonological loop]] (PL), stores phonological information (that is, the sound of language) and prevents its decay by continuously refreshing it in a [[memory rehearsal|rehearsal]] loop. It can, for example, maintain a seven-digit telephone number for as long as one repeats the number to oneself again and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Variations in psychology|last = Weiten|first = W.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 281–282|edition = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other slave system, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Visuospatial sketchpad|visuospatial sketchpad]], stores visual and spatial information. It can be used, for example, for constructing and manipulating visual images and for representing mental maps. The sketchpad can be further broken down into a visual subsystem (dealing with such phenomena as shape, colour, and texture), and a spatial subsystem (dealing with location).

In 2000, Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth component, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Episodic buffer|episodic buffer]], which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information not covered by the slave systems (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;semantic information, musical information). The episodic buffer is also the link between working memory and long-term memory.&lt;ref name="Weiten 2013 281–282"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Variations in psychology|last = Weiten|first = W.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Belmont, CA|pages = 281–282|edition = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation. The episodic buffer resembles Tulving's concept of [[episodic memory]], but it differs in that the episodic buffer is a temporary store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nbu.bg/cogs/events/2002/materials/Markus/ep_bufer.pdf | title=The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? | author=Baddeley, A.

=== Working memory as part of long-term memory ===
[[Anders Ericsson]] and [[Walter Kintsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=Long-term working memory.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=2|pages=211–245|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.102.2.211|pmid=7740089|author=Ericsson, K. A.|author2=Kintsch, W.|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; have introduced the notion of "long-term working memory", which they define as a set of "retrieval structures" in long-term memory that enable seamless access to the information relevant for everyday tasks. In this way, parts of long-term memory effectively function as working memory. In a similar vein, [[Nelson Cowan|Cowan]] does not regard working memory as a separate system from [[long-term memory]]. Representations in working memory are a subset of representations in long-term memory. Working memory is organized into two embedded levels. The first consists of long-term memory representations that are activated. There can be many of these—there is theoretically no limit to the activation of representations in long-term memory. The second level is called the focus of attention. The focus is regarded as having a limited capacity and holds up to four of the activated representations.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cowan, Nelson |title=Attention and memory: an integrated framework |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-506760-6 |oclc=30475237 |accessdate=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oberauer has extended Cowan's model by adding a third component, a more narrow focus of attention that holds only one chunk at a time. The one-element focus is embedded in the four-element focus and serves to select a single chunk for processing. For example, four digits can be held in mind at the same time in Cowan's "focus of attention". When the individual wishes to perform a process on each of these digits—for example, adding the number two to each digit—separate processing is required for each digit since most individuals cannot perform several mathematical processes in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Attention, working memory, and long-term memory in multimedia learning: A integrated perspective based on process models of working memory|last = Schweppe|first = J.|date = 2014|journal = Educational Psychology Review|doi = 10.1007/s10648-013-9242-2|pmid = |issue = 2|volume = 26|page = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oberauer's attentional component selects one of the digits for processing and then shifts the attentional focus to the next digit, continuing until all digits have been processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oberauer K |title=Access to information in working memory: exploring the focus of attention |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=411–21 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12018494 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.28.3.411|citeseerx=10.1.1.163.4979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacity ==
Working memory is generally considered to have limited capacity. An early quantification of the capacity limit associated with short-term memory was the "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|magical number seven]]" suggested by Miller in 1956.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Miller GA |title=The magical number seven plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=81–97 |date=March 1956 |pmid=13310704 |doi=10.1037/h0043158|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }} Republished: {{Cite journal|author=Miller GA |title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information. 1956 |journal=Psychological Review |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=343–52 |date=April 1994 |pmid=8022966 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the information-processing capacity of young adults is around seven elements, which he called "chunks", regardless of whether the elements are digits, letters, words, or other units. Later research revealed this number depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span may be around seven for digits, six for letters, and five for words), and even on features of the [[chunking (psychology)|chunks]] within a category. For instance, span is lower for long than short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) depends on the phonological complexity of the content (i.e., the number of phonemes, the number of syllables),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Service|first=Elisabet|date=1998-05-01|title=The Effect of Word Length on Immediate Serial Recall Depends on Phonological Complexity, Not Articulatory Duration|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A|volume=51|issue=2|pages=283–304|doi=10.1080/713755759|issn=0272-4987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the lexical status of the contents (whether the contents are words known to the person or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Charles |last1=Hulme |first2=Steven |last2=Roodenrys |first3=Gordon |last3=Brown |first4=Robin |last4=Mercer |date=November 1995 |title=The role of long-term memory mechanisms in memory span |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=527–36 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1996-29539-001 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other factors affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and fewer in children and old adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Nelson |last1=Cowan |year=2001 |title=The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=87–185 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X01003922 |pmid=11515286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas most adults can repeat about seven digits in correct order, some individuals have shown impressive enlargements of their digit span—up to 80 digits. This feat is possible by extensive training on an encoding strategy by which the digits in a list are grouped (usually in groups of three to five) and these groups are encoded as a single unit (a chunk). For this to succeed, participants must be able to recognize the groups as some known string of digits. One person studied by Ericsson and his colleagues, for example, used an extensive knowledge of racing times from the history of sports in the process of coding chunks: several such chunks could then be combined into a higher-order chunk, forming a hierarchy of chunks. In this way, only some chunks at the highest level of the hierarchy must be retained in working memory, and for retrieval the chunks are unpacked. That is, the chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point to the digits they contain. Practicing memory skills such as these does not expand working memory capacity proper: it is the capacity to transfer (and retrieve) information from long-term memory that is improved, according to Ericsson and Kintsch (1995; see also Gobet &amp; Simon, 2000&lt;ref name="Gobet F 2000 551–70"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 2000|title=Some shortcomings of long-term working memory|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=91|issue=Pt 4|pages=551–70|doi=10.1348/000712600161989|pmid=11104178|author=Gobet F|url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/807|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Measures and correlates ===
Working memory capacity can be tested by a variety of tasks. A commonly used measure is a dual-task paradigm, combining a [[memory span]] measure with a concurrent processing task, sometimes referred to as "complex span". Daneman and Carpenter invented the first version of this kind of task, the "[[reading span]]", in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Meredyth |last1=Daneman |first2=Patricia A. |last2=Carpenter |date=August 1980 |title=Individual differences in working memory and reading |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=450–66 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(80)90312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects read a number of sentences (usually between two and six) and tried to remember the last word of each sentence. At the end of the list of sentences, they repeated back the words in their correct order. Other tasks that do not have this dual-task nature have also been shown to be good measures of working memory capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Süss|first2=H.-M.|last3=Schulze|first3=R.|last4=Wilhelm|first4=O.|last5=Wittmann|first5=W.&amp;nbsp;W.|date=December 2000|title=Working memory capacity—facets of a cognitive ability construct|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1017–45|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(99)00251-2|via=|first1=K.|last1=Oberauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Daneman and Carpenter believed that the combination of "storage" (maintenance) and processing is needed to measure working memory capacity, we know now that the capacity of working memory can be measured with short-term memory tasks that have no additional processing component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=Nash|last2=Engle|first2=Randall W.|title=On the division of short-term and working memory: An examination of simple and complex span and their relation to higher order abilities.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=133|issue=6|pages=1038–1066|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.6.1038|pmid=17967093|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colom, R.

Measures of working-memory capacity are strongly related to performance in other complex cognitive tasks, such as reading comprehension, problem solving, and with measures of [[intelligence quotient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Conway AR, Kane MJ, Engle RW |title=Working memory capacity and its relation to general intelligence |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=547–52 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14643371 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.005|citeseerx=10.1.1.538.4967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have argued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Engle, R. W.|author2=Tuholski, S. W.|author3=Laughlin, J. E.|author4=Conway, A. R. |title=Working memory, short-term memory, and general fluid intelligence: a latent-variable approach |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=128 |issue=3 |pages=309–31 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10513398 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.3.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; that working-memory capacity reflects the efficiency of executive functions, most notably the ability to maintain multiple task-relevant representations in the face of distracting irrelevant information; and that such tasks seem to reflect individual differences in the ability to focus and maintain attention, particularly when other events are serving to capture attention. Both working memory and executive functions rely strongly, though not exclusively, on frontal brain areas.&lt;ref name="Kane MJ, Engle RW 2002 637–71"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03196323|author=Kane, M. J.|author2=Engle, R. W.|title=The role of prefrontal cortex in working-memory capacity, executive attention, and general fluid intelligence: an individual-differences perspective |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=637–71 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12613671 |url=http://pbr.psychonomic-journals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12613671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have argued that the capacity of working memory is better characterized as the ability to mentally form relations between elements, or to grasp relations in given information. This idea has been advanced, among others, by Graeme Halford, who illustrated it by our limited ability to understand statistical interactions between variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Halford, G. S.|author2=Baker, R.|author3=McCredden, J. E.|author4=Bain, J. D. |title=How many variables can humans process? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=70–76 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15660854 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00782.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors asked people to compare written statements about the relations between several variables to graphs illustrating the same or a different relation, as in the following sentence: "If the cake is from France, then it has more sugar if it is made with chocolate than if it is made with cream, but if the cake is from Italy, then it has more sugar if it is made with cream than if it is made of chocolate". This statement describes a relation between three variables (country, ingredient, and amount of sugar), which is the maximum most individuals can understand. The capacity limit apparent here is obviously not a memory limit (all relevant information can be seen continuously) but a limit to how many relationships are discerned simultaneously.

=== Experimental studies of working-memory capacity ===
There are several hypotheses about the nature of the capacity limit. One is that a limited pool of cognitive resources needed to keep representations active and thereby available for processing, and for carrying out processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Just, M. A.|author2=Carpenter, P. A. |title=A capacity theory of comprehension: individual differences in working memory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=122–49 |date=January 1992 |pmid=1546114 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.99.1.122|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1730&amp;context=psychology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that memory traces in working memory decay within a few seconds, unless refreshed through rehearsal, and because the speed of rehearsal is limited, we can maintain only a limited amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03198549|author=Towse, J.

====Decay theories====

The assumption that the contents of short-term or working memory decay over time, unless decay is prevented by rehearsal, goes back to the early days of experimental research on short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown, J.|year=1958|title=Some tests of the decay theory of immediate memory|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=10|pages=12–21|via=|doi=10.1080/17470215808416249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Peterson, L. R. |author2=Peterson, M.

D.|publisher=Clarendon|year=1986|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most elaborate decay-based theory of working memory to date is the "time-based resource sharing model".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=March 2004|title=Time constraints and resource sharing in adults' working memory spans|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=133|issue=1|pages=83–100|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.133.1.83|pmid=14979753|vauthors=Barrouillet P, Bernardin S, Camos V|citeseerx=10.1.1.379.9208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes that representations in working memory decay unless they are refreshed. Refreshing them requires an attentional mechanism that is also needed for any concurrent processing task. When there are small time intervals in which the processing task does not require attention, this time can be used to refresh memory traces. The theory therefore predicts that the amount of forgetting depends on the temporal density of attentional demands of the processing task—this density is called "cognitive load". The cognitive load depends on two variables, the rate at which the processing task requires individual steps to be carried out, and the duration of each step. For example, if the processing task consists of adding digits, then having to add another digit every half second places a higher cognitive load on the system than having to add another digit every two seconds. In a series of experiments, Barrouillet and colleagues have shown that memory for lists of letters depends neither on the number of processing steps nor the total time of processing but on cognitive load.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Time and cognitive load in working memory|date=May 2007|journal=J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn|vauthors=Barrouillet P, Bernardin S, Portrat S, Vergauwe E, Camos V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource theories====

Resource theories assume that the capacity of working memory is a limited resource that must be shared between all representations that need to be maintained in working memory simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first1=W. J.|author2=Husain, M.|author3=Bays, P. M.|year=2014|title=Changing concepts of working memory|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=17|issue=3|pages=347–356|via=|doi=10.1038/nn.3655|pmid=24569831|pmc=4159388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some resource theorists also assume that maintenance and concurrent processing share the same resource;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; this can explain why maintenance is typically impaired by a concurrent processing demand. Resource theories have been very successful in explaining data from tests of working memory for simple visual features, such as colors or orientations of bars. An ongoing debate is whether the resource is a continuous quantity that can be subdivided among any number of items in working memory, or whether it consists of a small number of discrete "slots", each of which can be assigned to one memory item, so that only a limited number of about 3 items can be maintained in working memory at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Berg|first=Ronald|last2=Awh|first2=Edward|last3=Ma|first3=Wei Ji|title=Factorial comparison of working memory models.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=121|issue=1|pages=124–149|doi=10.1037/a0035234|pmc=4159389|pmid=24490791|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interference theories====

Several forms of [[Interference theory|interference]] have been discussed by theorists. One of the oldest ideas is that new items simply replace older ones in working memory. Another form of interference is retrieval competition. For example, when the task is to remember a list of 7 words in their order, we need to start recall with the first word. While trying to retrieve the first word, the second word, which is represented in proximity, is accidentally retrieved as well, and the two compete for being recalled. Errors in serial recall tasks are often confusions of neighboring items on a memory list (so-called transpositions), showing that retrieval competition plays a role in limiting our ability to recall lists in order, and probably also in other working memory tasks. A third form of interference is the distortion of representations by superposition: When multiple representations are added on top of each other, each of them is blurred by the presence of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oberauer|first=Klaus|last2=Lewandowsky|first2=Stephan|last3=Farrell|first3=Simon|last4=Jarrold|first4=Christopher|last5=Greaves|first5=Martin|date=2012-06-20|title=Modeling working memory: An interference model of complex span|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=5|pages=779–819|doi=10.3758/s13423-012-0272-4|pmid=22715024|issn=1069-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth form of interference assumed by some authors is feature overwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.08.009 |title=A formal model of capacity limits in working memory |date=November 2006 |first1=Klaus |last1=Oberauer |first2=Reinhold |last2=Kliegl |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=601–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00221-010-2501-2 |pmid=21132280 |title=Distractor frequency influences performance in vibrotactile working memory |year=2011 |first1=T. |last1=Bancroft |first2=P. |last2=Servos |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=208 |issue=4 |pages=529–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that each word, digit, or other item in working memory is represented as a bundle of features, and when two items share some features, one of them steals the features from the other. The more items are held in working memory, and the more their features overlap, the more each of them will be degraded by the loss of some features.

==== Limitations ====
None of these hypotheses can explain the experimental data entirely. The resource hypothesis, for example, was meant to explain the trade-off between maintenance and processing: The more information must be maintained in working memory, the slower and more error prone concurrent processes become, and with a higher demand on concurrent processing memory suffers. This trade-off has been investigated by tasks like the reading-span task described above. It has been found that the amount of trade-off depends on the similarity of the information to be remembered and the information to be processed. For example, remembering numbers while processing spatial information, or remembering spatial information while processing numbers, impair each other much less than when material of the same kind must be remembered and processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.07.009 |title=The relationship between processing and storage in working memory span: Not two sides of the same coin |date=February 2007 |first1=Yukio |last1=Maehara |first2=Satoru |last2=Saito |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=212–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, remembering words and processing digits, or remembering digits and processing words, is easier than remembering and processing materials of the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1076/anec.6.2.99.784 |title=Selection from Working Memory: on the Relationship between Processing and Storage Components |date=June 1999 |last1=Li |first1=Karen Z.H. |journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=99–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are also difficult to explain for the decay hypothesis, because decay of memory representations should depend only on how long the processing task delays rehearsal or recall, not on the content of the processing task. A further problem for the decay hypothesis comes from experiments in which the recall of a list of letters was delayed, either by instructing participants to recall at a slower pace, or by instructing them to say an irrelevant word once or three times in between recall of each letter. Delaying recall had virtually no effect on recall accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03196705|vauthors=Lewandowsky S, Duncan M, Brown GD |title=Time does not cause forgetting in short-term serial recall |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=771–90 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15732687 |url=http://pbr.psychonomic-journals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15732687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Oberauer K, Lewandowsky S |title=Forgetting in immediate serial recall: decay, temporal distinctiveness, or interference? |journal=Psychological Review |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=544–76 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18729591 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.115.3.544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[interference theory]] seems to fare best with explaining why the similarity between memory contents and the contents of concurrent processing tasks affects how much they impair each other. More similar materials are more likely to be confused, leading to retrieval competition.

=== Childhood ===
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}

Measures of performance on tests of working memory increase continuously between early childhood and adolescence, while the structure of correlations between different tests remains largely constant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Starting with work in the Neo-Piagetian tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(70)90108-3 | last1 = Pascual-Leone | first1 = J. | year = 1970 | title = A mathematical model for the transition rule in Piaget's developmental stages | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 301–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1985). Intellectual development. Birth to adulthood. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; theorists have argued that the growth of working-memory capacity is a major driving force of cognitive development. This hypothesis has received substantial empirical support from studies showing that the capacity of working memory is a strong predictor of cognitive abilities in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrold, C., &amp; Bayliss, D. M. (2007). Variation in working memory due to typical and atypical development. In A. R. A. Conway, C. Jarrold, M. J. Kane, A. Miyake &amp; J. N. Towse (Eds.), Variation in working memory (pp. 137–161). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly strong evidence for a role of working memory for development comes from a longitudinal study showing that working-memory capacity at one age predicts reasoning ability at a later age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01895.x | last1 = Kail | first1 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Longitudinal evidence that increases in processing speed and working memory enhance children's reasoning | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 312–313 | pmid = 17470254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in the Neo-Piagetian tradition have added to this picture by analyzing the complexity of cognitive tasks in terms of the number of items or relations that have to be considered simultaneously for a solution. Across a broad range of tasks, children manage task versions of the same level of complexity at about the same age, consistent with the view that working memory capacity limits the complexity they can handle at a given age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0285(02)00002-6 | last1 = Andrews | first1 = G. | last2 = Halford | first2 = G.

=== Aging ===
Working memory is among the cognitive functions most sensitive to decline in [[old age]].&lt;ref name="Hertzog 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hertzog C, Dixon RA, Hultsch DF, MacDonald SW |title=Latent change models of adult cognition: are changes in processing speed and working memory associated with changes in episodic memory? |journal=Psychol Aging |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=755–69 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14692862 |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.4.755 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Park, D.

One is the processing speed theory of cognitive aging by Tim Salthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.403 | last1 = Salthouse | first1 = T.

However, the decline of working-memory capacity cannot be entirely attributed to slowing because capacity declines more in old age than speed.&lt;ref name="Park, D. C. 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(95)00689-3 | last1 = Mayr | first1 = U. | last2 = Kliegl | first2 = R. | last3 = Krampe | first3 = R.

(1988). Working memory, comprehension, and aging: A review and new view. In G. H. Bower (Ed.), ''The psychology of learning and motivation'', ''Vol. 22'', (pp. 193–225). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes a general deficit in old age in the ability to inhibit irrelevant, or no-longer relevant, information. Therefore, working memory tends to be cluttered with irrelevant contents that reduce the effective capacity for relevant content. The assumption of an inhibition deficit in old age has received much empirical support&lt;ref&gt;Hasher, L., Zacks, R.&amp;nbsp;T., &amp; May, C.&amp;nbsp;P. (1999). Inhibitory control, circadian arousal, and age. In D.&amp;nbsp;Gopher &amp; A.&amp;nbsp;Koriat (Eds.), ''Attention and Performance'' (pp. 653–675). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but, so far, it is not clear whether the decline in inhibitory ability fully explains the decline of working-memory capacity. An explanation on the neural level of the decline of working memory and other cognitive functions in old age has been proposed by West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.120.2.272 | last1 = West | first1 = R.&amp;nbsp;L. | year = 1996 | title = An application of prefrontal cortex function theory to cognitive aging | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 120 | issue = 2| pages = 272–292 | pmid = 8831298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that working memory depends to a large degree on the [[pre-frontal cortex]], which deteriorates more than other brain regions as we grow old.

== Training ==
{{further|Working memory training|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Cognitive control and memory}}

Torkel Klingberg was the first to investigate whether intensive training of working memory has beneficial effects on other cognitive functions. His pioneering study suggested that working memory can be improved by training in ADHD patients through computerized programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Klingberg, T.|author2=Forssberg, H.|author3=Westerberg, H. |title=Training of working memory in children with ADHD |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=781–91 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12424652 |doi=10.1076/jcen.24.6.781.8395|citeseerx=10.1.1.326.5165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has found that a period of [[working memory training]] increases a range of cognitive abilities and increases IQ test scores. Another study of the same group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=January 2004|title=Increased prefrontal and parietal activity after training of working memory|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=7|issue=1|pages=75–9|doi=10.1038/nn1165|pmid=14699419|vauthors=Olesen PJ, Westerberg H, Klingberg T}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that, after training, measured brain activity related to working memory increased in the prefrontal cortex, an area that many researchers have associated with working memory functions. It has been shown in one study that working memory training increases the density of [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[parietal cortex|parietal]] [[dopamine receptor]]s (specifically, [[DRD1]]) in test persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=February 2009|title=Changes in cortical dopamine D1 receptor binding associated with cognitive training|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5915|pages=800–2|bibcode=2009Sci...323..800M|doi=10.1126/science.1166102|pmid=19197069|author=McNab, F.|author2=Varrone, A.|author3=Farde, L.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent work with the same training program has failed to replicate the beneficial effects of training on cognitive performance. A meta-analytic summary of research with Klingberg's training program up to 2011 shows that this training has at best a negligible effect on tests of intelligence and of attention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulme, C. &amp; Melby-Lervåg, M.|year=2012|title=Current evidence does not support the claims made for CogMed working memory training|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition|volume=1|issue=3|pages=197–200|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2012.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the brain ==

=== Neural mechanisms of maintaining information ===
The first insights into the neuronal and neurotransmitter basis of working memory came from animal research. The work of Jacobsen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacobsen CF|title= Studies of cerebral function in primates |journal=Comparative Psychology Monographs |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=1–68 |year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fulton in the 1930s first showed that lesions to the PFC impaired spatial working memory performance in monkeys. The later work of [[Joaquin Fuster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fuster JM |title=Unit activity in prefrontal cortex during delayed-response performance: neuronal correlates of transient memory |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=61–78 |date=January 1973 |pmid=4196203 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4196203|doi=10.1152/jn.1973.36.1.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the PFC of monkeys while they were doing a delayed matching task. In that task, the monkey sees how the experimenter places a bit of food under one of two identical-looking cups. A shutter is then lowered for a variable delay period, screening off the cups from the monkey's view. After the delay, the shutter opens and the monkey is allowed to retrieve the food from under the cups. Successful retrieval in the first attempt – something the animal can achieve after some training on the task – requires holding the location of the food in memory over the delay period. Fuster found neurons in the PFC that fired mostly during the delay period, suggesting that they were involved in representing the food location while it was invisible. Later research has shown similar delay-active neurons also in the posterior [[parietal cortex]], the [[thalamus]], the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]], and the [[globus pallidus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ashby FG, Ell SW, Valentin VV, Casale MB |title=FROST: a distributed neurocomputational model of working memory maintenance |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=17 |issue=11 |pages=1728–43 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16269109 |doi=10.1162/089892905774589271|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.7179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Patricia Goldman-Rakic|Goldman-Rakic]] and others showed that principal sulcal, dorsolateral PFC interconnects with all of these brain regions, and that neuronal microcircuits within PFC are able to maintain information in working memory through recurrent excitatory glutamate networks of pyramidal cells that continue to fire throughout the delay period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goldman-Rakic PS|title= Cellular basis of working memory |journal=Neuron |volume=14 |issue= 3 |pages=447–485 |year=1995 | pmid = 7695894 | doi = 10.1016/0896-6273(95)90304-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These circuits are tuned by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rao SG, Williams GV, Goldman-Rakic PS |title= Destruction and creation of spatial tuning by disinhibition: GABA(A) blockade of prefrontal cortical neurons engaged by working memory |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=20 |pages=485–494 |year=2000|pmid=10627624 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neuromodulatory arousal systems markedly alter PFC working memory function; for example, either too little or too much dopamine or norepinephrine impairs PFC network firing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.05.003|author1=Arnsten AFT |author2=Paspalas CD |author3=Gamo NJ |author4=Y.

The research described above on persistent firing of certain neurons in the delay period of working memory tasks shows that the brain has a mechanism of keeping representations active without external input. Keeping representations active, however, is not enough if the task demands maintaining more than one chunk of information. In addition, the components and features of each chunk must be bound together to prevent them from being mixed up. For example, if a red triangle and a green square must be remembered at the same time, one must make sure that "red" is bound to "triangle" and "green" is bound to "square". One way of establishing such bindings is by having the neurons that represent features of the same chunk fire in synchrony, and those that represent features belonging to different chunks fire out of sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=August 2001|title=A cortical mechanism for binding in visual working memory|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=13|issue=6|pages=766–85|doi=10.1162/08989290152541430|pmid=11564321|vauthors=Raffone A, Wolters G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example, neurons representing redness would fire in synchrony with neurons representing the triangular shape, but out of sync with those representing the square shape. So far, there is no direct evidence that working memory uses this binding mechanism, and other mechanisms have been proposed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The unity of consciousness: Binding, integration, and dissociation|last2=Busby|first2=Richard S.|last3=Soto|first3=Rodolfo|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-850857-1|location=Oxford|pages=168–90|chapter=Three forms of binding and their neural substrates: Alternatives to temporal synchrony|oclc=50747505|first1=Randall C.|last1=O'Reilly|editor1-first=Axel|editor1-last=Cleeremans|chapterurl=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-88180-008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that synchronous firing of neurons involved in working memory oscillate with frequencies in the [[theta rhythm|theta]] band (4 to 8&amp;nbsp;Hz).

=== Localization in the brain ===
Localization of brain functions in humans has become much easier with the advent of [[brain imaging]] methods ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]]). This research has confirmed that areas in the PFC are involved in working memory functions. During the 1990s much debate has centered on the different functions of the ventrolateral (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;lower areas) and the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral (higher) areas of the PFC]]. A human lesion study provides additional evidence for the role of the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] in working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Koenigs|first2=Michael|last3=Grafman|first3=Jordan|year=2013|title=Dorsolateral prefrontal contributions to human working memory|journal=Cortex|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1195–1205|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2012.05.022|pmid=22789779|last1=Barbey|first1=Aron K.|pmc=3495093}}&lt;/ref&gt; One view was that the dorsolateral areas are responsible for spatial working memory and the ventrolateral areas for non-spatial working memory. Another view proposed a functional distinction, arguing that ventrolateral areas are mostly involved in pure maintenance of information, whereas dorsolateral areas are more involved in tasks requiring some processing of the memorized material. The debate is not entirely resolved but most of the evidence supports the functional distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Owen, A.

There is a tendency for spatial tasks to recruit more right-hemisphere areas, and for verbal and object working memory to recruit more left-hemisphere areas.

There is an emerging consensus that most working memory tasks recruit a network of PFC and parietal areas.

A current debate concerns the function of these brain areas. The PFC has been found to be active in a variety of tasks that require executive functions.&lt;ref name="Kane MJ, Engle RW 2002 637–71" /&gt; This has led some researchers to argue that the role of PFC in working memory is in controlling attention, selecting strategies, and manipulating information in working memory, but not in maintenance of information.

A 2003 meta-analysis of 60 neuroimaging studies found left [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] cortex was involved in low-task demand verbal working memory and right [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] cortex for spatial working memory. Brodmann's areas (BAs) [[Brodmann area 6|6]], [[Brodmann area 8|8]], and [[Brodmann area 9|9]], in the [[Superior frontal gyrus|superior frontal cortex]] was involved when working memory must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order had to be maintained. Right Brodmann [[Brodmann area 10|10]] and [[Brodmann area 10|47]] in the ventral frontal cortex were involved more frequently with demand for manipulation such as dual-task requirements or mental operations, and Brodmann 7 in the [[posterior parietal cortex]] was also involved in all types of executive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of working memory: a meta-analysis|journal = Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 1530-7026|pmid = 15040547|pages = 255–274|volume = 3|issue = 4|first = Tor D.|last = Wager|first2 = Edward E.|last2 = Smith|doi=10.3758/cabn.3.4.255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of recognition tasks is that they require minimal movement (just pressing one of two keys), making fixation of the head in the scanner easier. Experimental research and research on individual differences in working memory, however, has used largely recall tasks (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[reading span task]], see below). It is not clear to what degree recognition and recall tasks reflect the same processes and the same capacity limitations.

Brain imaging studies have been conducted with the reading span task or related tasks. Increased activation during these tasks was found in the PFC and, in several studies, also in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC). People performing better on the task showed larger increase of activation in these areas, and their activation was correlated more over time, suggesting that their neural activity in these two areas was better coordinated, possibly due to stronger connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kondo, H.|author2=Osaka, N.|author3=Osaka, M.|title=Cooperation of the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for attention shifting |journal=NeuroImage |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=670–9 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15488417 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Osaka N, Osaka M, Kondo H, Morishita M, Fukuyama H, Shibasaki H |title=The neural basis of executive function in working memory: an fMRI study based on individual differences |journal=NeuroImage |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=623–31 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14980565 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study of 37 school-age children with significant learning disabilities has shown that working memory capacity at baseline measurement, but not IQ, predicts learning outcomes two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Tracy Packiam |last1=Alloway |year=2009 |journal=European Journal of Psychological Assessment |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=92–8 |doi=10.1027/1015-5759.25.2.92 |title=Working Memory, but Not IQ, Predicts Subsequent Learning in Children with Learning Difficulties|hdl=1893/1005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that working memory impairments are associated with low learning outcomes and constitute a high risk factor for educational underachievement for children.

== Relation to attention ==

== Relationship with neural disorders ==

An impairment of working memory functioning is normally seen in several neural disorders:

'''ADHD:''' Several authors&lt;ref&gt;Barkley; Castellanos and Tannock; Pennington and Ozonoff; Schachar (according to the source)&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that symptoms of [[ADHD]] arise from a primary deficit in a specific executive function (EF) domain such as working memory, response inhibition or a more general weakness in executive control.&lt;ref name="WillcuttDoyle2005"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2005|title=Validity of the executive function theory of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analytic review|url=|journal=Biol. Psychiatry|volume=57|issue=11|pages=1336–46|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.02.006|pmid=15950006|vauthors=Willcutt EG, Doyle AE, Nigg JT, Faraone SV, Pennington BF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analytical review cites several studies that found significant lower group results for ADHD in spatial and verbal working memory tasks, and in several other EF tasks. However, the authors concluded that EF weaknesses neither are necessary nor sufficient to cause all cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name="WillcuttDoyle2005" /&gt;

Several [[neurotransmitters]], such as [[dopamine]] and [[glutamate]] may be both involved in ADHD and working memory. Both are associated with the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] brain, self-direction and self-regulation, but [[Causality|cause–effect]] have not been confirmed, so it is unclear whether working memory dysfunction leads to ADHD, or ADHD distractibility leads to poor functionality of working memory, or if there is some other connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/adhd.2008.16.6.8 Working Memory as a Core Deficit in ADHD: Preliminary Findings and Implications] – 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark Blackwell 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2007|title=Association between response inhibition and working memory in adult ADHD: a link to right frontal cortex pathology?|url=|journal=Biol.

'''Parkinson's disease''':&amp;nbsp;Patients with [[Parkinson's]] show signs of a reduced verbal function of working memory. They wanted to find if the reduction is due to a lack of ability to focus on relevant tasks, or a low amount of memory capacity. Twenty-one patients with Parkinson's were tested in comparison to the control group of 28 participants of the same age.The researchers found that both hypotheses were the reason working memory function is reduced which did not fully agree with their hypothesis that it is either one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2929336|title=Visual working memory deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease are due to both reduced storage capacity and impaired ability to filter out irrelevant information|last=Lee|first=Eun-Young|date=August 5, 2010|journal=Brain|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2677–2689|doi=10.1093/brain/awq197|pmid=20688815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alzheimer's disease''': As [[Alzheimer's disease]] becomes more serious, less working memory functions. There is one study that focuses on the neural connections and fluidity of working memory in mice brains. Half of the mice were given an injection that is similar to Alzheimer's effects, and the other half were not. Then they were expected to go through a maze that is a task to test working memory. The study help answer questions about how Alzheimer's can deteriorate the working memory and ultimately obliterate memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiaotiao|first=Liu|date=December 2014|title=Functional connectivity in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease during a working memory task|journal=Current Alzheimer Research|volume=11|issue=10|pages=981–991|doi=10.2174/1567205011666141107125912 |pmid=25387338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huntington's disease''':&amp;nbsp;A group of researchers hosted a study that researched the function and connectivity of working memory over a 30-month longitudinal experiment. It found that there were certain places in the brain where most connectivity was decreased in pre-[[Huntington disease]]d patients, in comparison to the control group that remained consistently functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poudel|first=Govinda R.|date=January 2015|title=Functional changes during working memory in Huntington's disease: 30-month longitudinal data from the IMAGE-HD study|journal=Brain Structure and Function|volume=220|issue=1|pages=501–512|pmid=24240602|doi=10.1007/s00429-013-0670-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;
