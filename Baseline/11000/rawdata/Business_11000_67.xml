In [[Bangladesh]], the profession of [[accountancy]] developed during the British colonial period. The basic requirements for financial reporting by all companies in Bangladesh are provided by the Companies Act of 1994. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/asia/bangladesh|title=Bangladesh|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iasplus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is represented by two professional bodies, the [[Institute of Cost &amp; Management Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICMAB) and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICAB).

Chartered Accountants complete their training in practising firms and specialise in financial accounting, financial audit and tax. CMAs receive particular training in cost audit, management audit and management accounting, as well as general accounting and taxation. Both the ICMAB and ICAB are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Commerce. The Government of Bangladesh considers both type of professional accountants equal in respect of employment in government services per circular No.Com/PTMA/AP/2/19/87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmab.org.bd/index.php/2011-06-13-09-13-35/services-of-cmas |title=Services of CMAs |website=Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh |access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP) in Bangladesh are based upon standards set by the ICAB, which has stated its intention to adopt [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].  {{As of|2013}}, ICAB has adopted the IFRS as issued by the IASB, except for [[IAS 39]], IAS 29, and IFRS 9 &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and All foreign companies, and domestic companies listed on the [[Dhaka Stock Exchange]] (DSE) and/or the [[Chittagong Stock Exchange]] (CSE) are required to use IFRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David O'Regan |date=2003 |chapter=Bangladesh |title=International auditing: practical resource guide |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |pages=138 |isbn=0-471-26382-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifrs.org/Use-around-the-world/Documents/Jurisdiction-profiles/Bangladesh-IFRS-Profile.pdf |title=IFRS Application Around the World Jurisdictional Profile: Bangladesh |website=IFRS |access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards (BFRS) ==
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) prescribes Financial Reporting Standards which are known as Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards (BFRS). Bangladesh Accounting Standards (BAS) are also included in BFRS. International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board are what the BFRS models on. For listed companies under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, adopted BFRS are legally enforceable. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Accountants Profession of Bangladesh ==
The professional Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh's national body is the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB). In order to promote and regulate the Cost and Management Accounting profession in the country, the ICMAB was established. To students interested in pursuing a career in this field, the institute offers training and education and highly recognized CMA degrees on fulfillment of their qualifications. The ICMAB is the sole authority to issue licences to their members for practice in the field.  

They have many visions and missions. By promoting and regulating Cost and Management Accounting they want to improve the quality of life and economic competitiveness which will eventually lead to helping Bangladesh become and industrialized nation. The institute's mission is to provide better service to the society by having its members maintain the highest professional standard while developing, equipping, and promoting the Cost and Management Accounting profession. Implementation of National Accounting as well as Cost Accounting Standards are also used with other necessary steps in order to regulate the profession. The ultimate goal of this is to develop Bangladesh's natural and human resources to enrich the shared future of the country and to ensure common welfare. 

The Institute is governed by a council which is under the provision of the Cost and Management Accountants Ordinance of 1977. There are twelve members consisted in the council and they are elected by the members of ICMAB. The council also consists of four nominees from the Government of Bangladesh. Each term is for three years and every year there is one President, two Vice- Presidents, one Secretary, and one Treasurer elected from the councilors. A team of fully employed personnel, however, manages the day to day administrative affairs of the institute. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icmab.org.bd/index.php/about-us/the-institute|title=The Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=www.icmab.org.bd|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) ==
The sole regulator of accountants and auditors in Bangladesh under the Bangladesh Chartered Accountants Order of 1973 was the Institute of Charted Accountants (ICAB). There are many mandatory requirements included in the ICAB: 
# Determining if you are qualified for membership in the institute
# Being able to see the initial and continuing professional development of its members
# Having professional examinations conducted
# Establishing and maintaining a quality assurance review system
# Being able to licence auditors
# Maintaining and publishing of its members qualified to practice as accountants and auditors
# Investigating and disciplining its members for misconduct professionally
# Allowing them to set accounting and auditing standards 
Membership in the ICAB is mandatory for all Chartered Accountants whether financial accountant or financial auditor. Fellow Chartered Accountants or Associate Chartered Accountants are usually what members of the ICAB are designated as. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members/institute-chartered-accountants-bangladesh|title=Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh {{!}} IFAC|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ifac.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ananda Krishnan was born in 1938 in [[Brickfields]], Kuala Lumpur to [[Tamil people|Tamil]] parents, who were of [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan]] origin. He studied at Vivekananda Tamil School in Brickfields and furthered his studies at [[Victoria Institution]], Kuala Lumpur. Later, as a [[Colombo Plan]] scholar, he attended the [[University of Melbourne]], Australia for his B.A. (Honours) degree majoring in political science. During that time he boarded in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]. Following that, Krishnan obtained a [[Master of Business Administration|Masters in Business Administration]] from [[Harvard Business School]], graduating in 1964.&lt;ref name=A&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|title= Ananda Krishnan |author=|author2= |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/YK1N.html|publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=26 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518063321/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/YK1N.html| archivedate= 18 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnan has two daughters and a son who is also a [[Theravada]] Buddhist monk known as Ajahn Siripanyo.&lt;ref name="monk flew"&gt;{{cite web|title=The monk who flew in a jet |url=http://www.businessbhutan.bt/?p=3954 |publisher=Business Bhutan |date=1 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720090028/http://businessbhutan.bt/the-monk-who-flew-in-a-jet/ |archivedate=20 July 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ananda Krishnan makes time for son|last=Chow|first=Tan Sin|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2012/04/24/ananda-krishnan-makes-time-for-son/|date=24 April 2012|publisher=The Star |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Krishnan's first entrepreneurial venture was a [[Malaysia]]n consultancy MAI Holdings Sdn Bhd. He set up Exoil Trading, which went on to purchase oil drilling concessions in various countries. Later, he moved into gambling (in Malaysia). In the early part of the 1990s, he started diversifying into the multimedia arena.

Currently, he has business interests in media ([[Astro (television)|Astro]], Johnston Press Plc), satellite ([[MEASAT Satellite Systems|MEASAT]], [[SES S.A.|SES]]), oil and gas (Bumi Armada, Pexco), telecommunications ([[Maxis Communications|Maxis]], [[Aircel]], [[AXIS Telekom Indonesia|Axis]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]]). He owns stakes in [[Tanjong|Tanjong Public Limited Company]], an investment holding company with subsidiaries involved in power generation ([[Powertek]]), gaming (Pan Malaysian Pools), leisure (tropical islands, [[TGV Cinemas]]) and property (67% Maxis Tower etc.).

== Multimedia ==
Krishnan first came to prominence by helping to organise the Live Aid concert with Bob Geldof in the mid-1980s. In the early 1990s, he began building a multimedia empire that now includes two telecommunication companies—[[Maxis Communications]], [[MEASAT Satellite Systems|MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems]] and [[SES World Skies]]—and has three communication satellites circumnavigating the earth.

He effected the purchase of 46% of [[Maxis Communications]], the country's largest cellular phone company, from [[América Móvil]], [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], [[BT Group|British Telecom]], [[Proximus Group|Belgacom]], [[Ooredoo]], [[Orange S.A.]] and [[KPN|Royal KPN N.V.]] for $1,180 million—raising his stake to 70%. Maxis has more than ten million subscribers, with around 40% market share in Malaysia. He also owns stakes in [[Aircel]], [[AXIS Telekom Indonesia|Axis]] and [[Sri Lanka Telecom]].

In an agreement between [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] and India's [[Sun Network]], Krishnan plans to produce TV channels which cater to the Indian market, especially [[Tamils|Tamil people]] in countries such as US, Western Europe and Middle East. He also plans to offer TV services featuring Web-based interactivity. Ananda Krishnan owns stakes in [[TVB]].com and the [[List of Shaw Brothers films|Shaw Brothers]] movie archives.

== Philanthropy ==
Ananda Krishnan donates to education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/ananda-krishnan-net-worth/|title=Ananda Krishnan Net Worth {{!}} TheRichest|website=www.therichest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the arts, sports and humanitarian causes in Malaysia through his company Usaha Tegas, and its subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.focusmalaysia.my/Mainstream/charitable-tycoons|title=Charitable tycoons|work=Focus Malaysia|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His philanthropic work is largely focused on developing talent in Malaysia by offering scholarships and supporting school programs. He funds the development of internet boot camps for rural high schools, supports Malaysian equestrian sportsmen and Olympic athletes, and offers stipends for local children studying Indian classical dance and music.

One of his first  charity acts was contributing to the organization of the 1985 Live Aid rock concert, which raised $240 million for African famine relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pagalavan.com/politics/heroes-of-philanthropy/|title=Heroes of Philanthropy|date=2010-03-08|work=Pagalavan's Avatar|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Krishnan's Usaha Tegas launched the Harapan Nusantara education fund. Since 2004 the fund has sponsored 100 students a year to attend special programs at local private universities that collaborate with foreign universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2003/06/26/harapan-nusantara-puts-up-rm100m-to-benefit-malay-students/|title=Harapan Nusantara puts up RM100m to benefit Malay students - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the company also started the Yu Cai Education Foundation with a grant of $6.6 million to help ethnic Chinese groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0315/philanthropy-technology-telecom-malaysia-billionaire-ananda-krishnan.html#410807fd77c5|title=Malaysia's Telecom Billionaire Gives Back|last=Mertens|first=Brian|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 Ananda Krishnan's media company Astro introduced its scholarship program, promising to devote an annual RM2 million to support promising Malaysian undergraduate and graduate students studying media and broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2006/11/30/astro-support-for-ad-industry-hailed/|title=Astro support for ad industry hailed - Community {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he contributed to the opening of the Montfort Girls Centre to help orphaned and underprivileged girls develop their vocational skills. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0315/philanthropy-technology-telecom-malaysia-billionaire-ananda-krishnan.html#fe1863b77c50|title=Malaysia's Telecom Billionaire Gives Back|last=Mertens|first=Brian|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Albert Benbow''' (1870 – 29 March 1912) was a [[cricketer]] who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] in New Zealand from 1891 to 1897.

==Life and career==
Charles Benbow was born in England and migrated with his family in the 1870s to New Zealand, where his father was the manager of [[South British Insurance]] in [[Wellington]]. He attended [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]], then joined [[AMP Limited|the AMP Society]].&lt;ref name="TDN"&gt;{{cite news | work=Taranaki Daily News | date=30 March 1912 | page=4 | title= Obituary: Mr. C. A. Benbow| url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TDN19120330.2.18| accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He married Alice Birch in 1902, and in 1905 they moved to [[New Plymouth]], where he managed the new branch of the AMP Society. He and his wife had a daughter and a son. He died of pneumonia in New Plymouth on 29 March 1912 after a period of ill-health.&lt;ref name="TDN"/&gt; His funeral on 31 March was the largest in New Plymouth for some years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Taranaki Daily News | date=1 April 1912 | page=5 | title= Personal| url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TDN19120401.2.45| accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket career==
In his first first-class match Benbow was Wellington's most successful bowler in their one-wicket victory over [[Nelson cricket team|Nelson]], taking 3 for 35 and 4 for 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3772.html| title = Nelson v Wellington 1891-92| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best first-class figures were 4 for 9 (off 12 overs) against [[Fiji cricket team|Fiji]] in 1894-95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4267.html| title = Wellington v Fijians 1894-95| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cimpor - Cimentos de Portugal''' is the largest [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[cement]] group, operating in eleven countries - Portugal, [[Spain]], [[Morocco]], [[Brazil]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Mozambique]], [[China]], [[Egypt]] and [[South Africa]], involved in manufacturing and marketing cement, hydraulic lime, concrete and aggregates, [[precast concrete]] and dry mortars. The Brazilian company [[Camargo Corrêa]] is the owner of the company.

In Portugal, Cimpor has major factories in [[Coimbra]] (Souselas), [[Vila Franca de Xira]] (Alhandra), [[Loulé]] and [[Figueira da Foz]] (Cabo Mondego).

Cimpor is listed on the [[Euronext Lisbon]] stock exchange and is a member of the benchmark [[PSI-20]] index. The company was owned by two Brazilian conglomerates which built up stakes in February 2010 in order to thwart a €3.9 billion takeover bid from  [[steel]] maker [[Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional]] (CSN):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laxmidas|first=Shrikesh|title=Battle for Cimpor switches to Brazil cement rivals|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE61M18O20100223|accessdate=12 September 2010|date=23 February 2010|author2=Goncalves, Sergio|author3=Cunha Lima, Filipa|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camargo Corrêa]] holds 32.9% and the [[Votorantim Group]] 21.2% (of which 17.3% was purchased from [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] and 3.7% from Cinveste). A 9.6% stake in Cimpor held by the bank [[Caixa Geral de Depósitos]] is also imputable to Votorantim due to an agreement between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimpor.pt/artigo.aspx?cntx=kNvvknaNjvgwma7PVpGAyO7bHH4fL%2FLl4N4K1NR%2FccnsyTXhvVZWUzbJs4QBTfHw|title=Shareholder structure|date=20 December 2009|publisher=Cimpor|accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 with the purchase of additional shares and the exchange of certain assets to the Votorantim Group, Camargo Corrêa through its subsidiary [[InterCement]] now holds 94.8% stake in Cimpor and becomes its sole shareholder, with the remaining shares being traded on [[Euronext Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasileconomico.ig.com.br/noticias/camargo-correa-assume-controle-da-cimpor_118323.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2017, Cimpor's shareholders voted for Camargo Corrêa (owner of 95,1% of total shares) to acquire all of Cimpor's public shares in a move to remove the company from the Lisbon stock exchange.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/mercados/bolsa/detalhe/brasileiros-da-camargo-avancam-para-retirada-de-bolsa-da-cimpor&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''extraordinary general meeting''', commonly abbreviated as '''EGM''', is a meeting of members of an organisation, shareholders of a company, or employees of an official body that occurs at an irregular time.''&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/egm.asp EGM]&lt;/ref&gt;'' The term is usually used where the group would ordinarily hold an [[annual general meeting]] (AGM) but where an issue arises that requires the input of the entire membership and is too serious or urgent to wait until the next AGM. Members and/or shareholders must be informed of the purpose of the EGM so that they may attend in a position where they can discuss and exercise intelligent judgment, or else any resolutions passed are invalid.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jcEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA799&amp;dq=when+are+Extraordinary+General+Meeting+usually+called%3F&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20are%20Extraordinary%20General%20Meeting%20usually%20called%3F&amp;f=false Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Procedure: Before the EGM the [[Deliberative assembly|board]] of the organisation will have agreed upon one or more [[Resolution (law)|resolution]]s that will be put to the shareholders or members for approval at the EGM. The wording of the resolution is sent to the shareholders with a note about its importance. The theory is that the board has a better knowledge of the situation, and the resolution is in effect their ideal solution, but it may not be in the interests of individual shareholders. Usually, the chairman of the EGM reads out and recommends the resolution to those present for approval, takes questions about the resolution from those present, supervises the vote and declares the result. The rules for conducting an EGM and the options for altering a resolution at an EGM or for taking [[Proxy voting|proxy votes]] will vary from one organisation to another. 

In some settings, this is known as a special general meeting or an emergency general meeting.

In the United Kingdom, the directors of a public company must convene an EGM if the net assets fall to half or less of the amount of its called-up share capital (section 656 of the [[Companies Act 2006]]). Shareholders who meet certain criteria can requisition a general meeting: within 21 days from the date of receipt of requisition the directors must send out a notice to convene a meeting within 28 days after the date of giving the notice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5128">The '''Financial Stability Forum''' ('''FSF''') was a group consisting of major national financial authorities such as [[finance ministry|finance ministries]], [[central bank]]ers, and international financial bodies. It was first convened in April 1999 in Washington. At the [[2009 G20 London summit]], the [[G20]] nations established an FSF successor called the [[Financial Stability Board]] with an expanded membership and broadened mandate.&lt;ref name=thing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411064057/http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Forum was founded in 1999 to promote international financial stability. Its founding resulted from discussions among Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the [[G7]] countries, and a study which they commissioned.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html Genesis of the FSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html |date=June 14, 2008 }}, FSF website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum facilitated discussion and cooperation on supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, transactions and events. FSF was managed by a small secretariat housed at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="FSF home"&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org fsforum.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512222115/http://www.fsforum.org/ |date=2009-05-12 }}, main website.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF membership included about a dozen nations who participate through their central banks, financial ministries and departments, and securities regulators, including: the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]] and several other industrialized economies as well as several international economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html FSF:Who we are] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html |date=June 14, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the G20 summit on November 15, 2008, it was agreed that the membership of the FSF will be expanded to include emerging economies, such as China. The [[2009 G-20 London summit]] decided to establish a successor to the FSF, the [[Financial Stability Board]]. The FSB includes members of the G20 who were not members of FSF.&lt;ref name=thing/&gt;

==Meetings and actions==
The Financial Stability Forum met in [[Rome]] on 28–29 March 2008 in connection with the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. Members discussed current challenges in financial markets, and various policy options to address them from this point forward.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"&gt;[http://www.bis.org/press/p080329.htm Financial Stability Forum meets in Rome], 29 March 2008, Press release, Website of [[Bank for International Settlements]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this meeting, the FSF discussed a report to be delivered to [[G7]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2008. it identifies key weaknesses underlying current financial turmoil, and recommends actions to improve market and institutional resilience. The FSF discussed work underway at the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] with regard to [[sovereign wealth fund]]s (SWFs). The IMF is working closely with SWFs to identify a set of voluntary best practice guidelines, and is focusing on the governance, institutional arrangements and transparency of SWFs.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"/&gt;

On April 12, 2008, the FSF delivered a [https://web.archive.org/web/20080724030541/http://www.fsforum.org/publications/FSF_Report_to_G7_11_April.pdf report] to the G7 Finance Ministers which details out its recommendations for enhancing the resilience of the financial markets and financial institutions. These are in five areas:
*Strengthened prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management 
* Enhancing transparency and valuation 
* Changes in the role and uses of [[credit rating]]s
* Strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risks 
* Robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system [http://www.bis.org/press/p080412.htm]

'''Frank Harrison Walker''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] is a former British newspaper publisher on the island of [[Jersey]] who became the first [[Chief Minister of Jersey]], serving from 2005 to 2008.

==Career outside politics==
In 1973, at the age of 29, Walker became Managing Director of, and acquired a major shareholding in, W. E Guiton &amp; Co. Ltd., the parent company of the [[Jersey Evening Post]], the Island's only daily newspaper. In 1978 the newspaper moved to new custom designed premises and installed the latest print and typesetting technology. Over the next two decades the newspaper grew its readership, substantially increased advertising revenues and recorded steady increases in profit. The company diversified into print, travel, retailing and IT and became the Guiton Group, which was floated on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] of the [[London Stock Exchange]]. In 1990 Walker stood down as Group Managing Director and took over the Chairmanship of the Group. Shortly thereafter he led the team that acquired the [[Guernsey Evening Press]], the only daily newspaper in [[Guernsey]]. The group was sold, in February 2005, to the family who own the [[Wolverhampton Express and Star|Wolverhampton Express &amp; Star]] and other titles and businesses in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. Upon the completion of the sale Walker severed all connections with the company.

== Political record ==

Walker was first elected to the [[States of Jersey]], the Island Government, on 13 December 1990 as Deputy of St Helier No 3 District and topped the poll when he was re-elected in 1993; he was then elected as Senator, with an Island-wide mandate, in 1996 and re-elected in December 2002, at which time he stated that this would be his final term of office. Walker did not stand for re-election in 2008.

During his political career Walker held numerous committee presidencies including the Jersey Post Office, the Finance and Economics Committee and the Policy and Resources Committee. He was elected Jersey's first Chief Minister in 2005.

While a Senator, Walker was the subject of rumours that he was a "serial wife-beater" and also that he abused his office by receiving "improper and corrupt inducements". These allegations were never tested in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=12:01AM BST 27 Jul 2001 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1335453/Cream-of-Jersey-society-whips-up-scandal.html |title=Cream of Jersey society whips up scandal |publisher=Telegraph |date=2001-07-27 |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, Walker took legal action against a Jersey accountant and the then head of Jersey's volunteer police system for spreading these rumours. The case was settled out of court, with the two paying Walker's legal and other costs and taking out a full page advertisement in the local paper to apologise unreservedly for their actions. The advertisement also carried an unreserved apology from one of the men for falsely accusing Walker of accepting financial inducements from a development company.

When Walker left office Jersey had assumed responsibility for its own international affairs, previously undertaken by the United Kingdom Government, negotiated a number of Tax Information Exchange Agreements with EU and OECD member states, introduced a new form of indirect taxation, together with a new co-ordinated income support scheme for the less well-off, and Jersey had a balanced budget, no debt and substantial cash reserves.

In February 2008, allegations were made of widespread historic child abuse in Jersey in the 1970s.  Walker made it clear that his Council of Ministers would ensure that anyone who had been guilty of child abuse in that investigation would be brought to justice and that a fully independent public enquiry, chaired by a leading U.K. lawyer, would be established. Since then a number of individuals have been prosecuted and the enquiry, whose start was delayed due to police investigations, has commenced its work.

On 25 February 2008 in an interview with Jeremy Paxman on the BBC's Newsnight programme the BBC, unbeknown and invisible to Walker, used heavily edited footage of an interview he had previously given to BBC Jersey which sought to suggest he was more interested in Jersey's reputation than the victims of child abuse.

However, on 26 February 2009, the BBC Trust, the BBC's own Editorial Watchdog, upheld a complaint from a member of the public and released a report criticising the Newsnight programme for significant failings in the conduct of this interview, stating that the interview had not upheld the BBC's guidelines on fairness and impartiality, that Senator Walker had been misquoted, that Walker's earlier comments had been edited in a way as to misrepresent what Senator Walker had said and so as to mislead the audience and that the correction had not gone far enough in remedying the unfair implications that the quotes had suggested. Frank Walker stated that he was very happy with the outcome, and that he felt vindicated for what he felt was the low-point of his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2008/december.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113223346/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2008/december.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/02/26/bbc-admit-we-got-it-wrong/ |title=BBC admit: We got it wrong « This Is Jersey |publisher=Thisisjersey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours List.

==Current positions==

Walker now chairs Andium Homes, a company set up to bring all Jersey's social housing stock up to [[Decent Homes Standard]], and meet the needs of those struggling to buy their first property, and [[Digital Jersey]], the company charged with leading Jersey's technological development, both of which are fully owned by the States of Jersey. He also acts as trustee for Sanctuary House, a charitable organisation that seeks to assist disadvantaged and homeless men get their lives back on track, and is a [[churchwarden]] at [[St Brelade's Church]].

==Family==
He is married to Fiona and has four children, two step-children, six grandchildren and two step grand-children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7747">The '''Frasch process''' is a method to extract [[sulfur]] from underground deposits. It is the only industrial method of recovering sulfur from elemental deposits.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt; Most of the world's sulfur was obtained this way until the late 20th century, when sulfur recovered from petroleum and gas sources became more commonplace (see [[Claus process]]).

In the Frasch process, [[superheated water]] is pumped into the sulfur deposit; the sulfur melts and is extracted. The Frasch process is able to produce high purity sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulphurinstitute.org/learnmore/sulphur101.cfm The Sulphur Institute. "An Introduction to Sulphur."], accessed 17 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frasch Process used on a salt dome.png|thumb|400px|Illustration that shows the structure of a sulfur-containing salt dome and the details of the Frasch pump used to extract the sulfur from underground formations. Superheated water is pumped into the formation to melt the sulfur. The molten sulfur is lifted to the surface with compressed air.&lt;ref name=Ober/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haynes/&gt;]]
The Frasch sulfur process works best on either salt domes or bedded evaporite deposits, where sulfur is found in [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] rock layers trapped in between impermeable layers. Bacterial alteration of anhydrite or gypsum, in the presence of hydrocarbons, produces limestone and [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the [[sulfur cycle]]. The hydrogen sulfide then oxidizes into sulfur, from percolating water, or through the action of anaerobic, sulfur-reducing bacteria &lt;ref name=Ober&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ober |first1=Joyce |title=MATERIALS FLOW OF SULFUR, USGS Open-File Report 02-298 |date=2002 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of the Interior, USGS |pages=12-13 |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-298/of02-298.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haynes&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haynes |first1=Williams |title=Brimstone, The Stone that Burns |date=1959 |publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc. |location=Princeton |pages=4-5,54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, miners discovered [[sulfur]] in the [[caprock]] of a [[salt dome]] in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]], but it was beneath [[quicksand]], which prevented mining. In 1894 the German-born American chemist, [[Herman Frasch]] (1852–1914), devised his Frasch method of sulfur removal using pipes to bypass the quicksand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  | title = Obituaries - Herman Frasch, Paul L. V. Héroult | journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry  | year = 1914 | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 505–507 | doi = 10.1021/ie50066a024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process proved successful, on December 24, 1894, when the first molten sulfur was brought to the surface.  The [[Union Sulphur Company]] was incorporated in 1896 to utilize the process.  However, the high cost of fuel needed to heat the water made the process uneconomic until the 1901 discovery of the [[Spindletop]] oil field in Texas provided cheap fuel oil to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DsSmPKEOWDcC&amp;pg=PA1512 | author = D'Arcy Shock | year = 1992 | chapter = Frasch sulfur mining | title = SME Mining Engineering Handbook | publisher = Society for Mining Metallurgy and Exploration | pages = 1512 | format = [[Google Books]] excerpt| isbn = 9780873351003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Frasch process began economic production at [[Sulphur, Louisiana|Sulphur Mines, Louisiana]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=Ober/&gt;

When Frasch's patent expired, the process was widely applied to similar salt-dome sulfur deposits along the [[Gulf Coast]] of the United States.  The second Frasch-process mine opened in 1912 in [[Brazoria County, Texas]].  The Gulf Coast came to dominate world sulfur production in the early and middle 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dks04 Handbook of Texas Online: ''Sulfur industry''], accessed 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, starting in the 1970s, byproduct sulfur recovery from oil and natural gas lowered the price of sulfur and drove many Frasch-process mines out of business.  The last United States Frasch sulfur mine closed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-298/of02-298.pdf Joyce A. Ober (2002) ''Materials Flow of Sulfur'', US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 02-298], p.12, PDF file, retrieved 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A Frasch mine in Iraq closed in 2003 due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

The Frasch process is still used to work sulfur deposits in Mexico and Poland.

==Process==
[[File:Frasch Process.png|400px|right]]
In the Frasch process, three concentric tubes are introduced into the sulfur deposit. [[Superheated water]] (165&amp;nbsp;°C, 2.5-3 MPa) is injected into the deposit via the outermost tube. Sulfur (m.p.&amp;nbsp;115&amp;nbsp;°C) melts and flows into the middle tube. Water pressure alone is unable to force the sulfur into the surface due to the molten sulfur's greater density, so hot air is introduced via the innermost tube to froth the sulfur, making it less dense, and pushing it to the surface.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

The sulfur obtained can be very pure (99.7 - 99.8%). In this form, it is light yellow in color. If contaminated by organic compounds, it can be dark-colored; further purification is not economic, and usually unnecessary. Using this method, the United States produced 3.89 million tons of sulfur in 1989, and Mexico produced 1.02 million tons of sulfur in 1991.

The Frasch process can be used for deposits 50–800 meters deep. 3-38 cubic meters of superheated water are required to produce every tonne of sulfur, and the associated energy cost is significant.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt; A working demonstration model of the Frasch process suitable for the classroom has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed008p1630 | journal = [[J.

'''Sir George Campbell''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|KCSI|}} (1824 – 18 February 1892) was a Scottish [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician and Indian administrator.

Campbell was born in 1824, the eldest son of Sir George Campbell, of Edenwood, whose brother became the [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|1st Baron Campbell]]. He was educated at [[Hamilton Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association Magazine, February 1950, feature on Hamilton Academy in the article series 'Famous Scottish Schools'&lt;/ref&gt; and embarked for India.
[[File:George Campbell, Vanity Fair, 1878-09-21.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"Indian authority". Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1878.]]
From 1871 to 1874 he was Lieutenant-Governor of [[Bengal]]. During his tenure the [[Pabna District#History|Pabna Disturbances]] occurred. With his proclamation on 4 July 1873 during the [[Pabna Peasant Uprisings]], guaranteeing government support of peasants against excessive [[zamindar]] demands he ensured that the prostest remained peaceful, at the same time antagonising the landlords and his namesake [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll]] at that time Secretary of State for India.

He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Kirkcaldy Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy Burghs]] from 1875 to 1892.

Campbell married, in 1853, Laetitia Maria Vibart, daughter of John Gowan Vibart, of the Bengal civil service, and left several children.
Lady Campbell died in London 21 October 1901, aged 68.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Obituary - Lady Campbell|day_of_week=Wednesday |date=23 October 1901 |page_number=7 |issue=36593| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their eldest son, Major George Campbell (ca. 1861-1902), died while serving with the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|8th King's Regiment]] in the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Deaths|day_of_week=Monday |date=10 March 1902 |page_number=1 |issue=36711| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harald Nordenson''' (1886–1980) was born in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]]. He earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1914 at [[Uppsala University]], where he served as Assistant Professor in physical chemistry 1914-1919. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1948{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} and chairman or member in different industrial, political and cultural boards, Nordenson held positions in industry as technical director and CEO. He wrote his first book about Einstein’s theories in Swedish in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which developed into his 1969 English book, ''Relativity, Time and Reality''

&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the philosophy of Hägerström and Phalèn, and describes also their opinions about Einstein’s theories in his book, together with reviews of many other contributors.

His book, ''Relativity, Time and Reality'', is a controversial critique of [[Albert Einstein]]'s concepts of time and simultaneity in [[Special Relativity]].  His arguments have been generally considered invalid.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The primary objection in the first part of his critique is that Einstein's concept of simultaneity, while seemingly not depending on Newtonian time, nevertheless presupposes it:

{{cquote|1=Both in the Special and the General Theory the characterization of the movement of our system of reference ''K&amp;prime;'' in relation to another presupposes a time concept valid for the whole of space.&lt;br /&gt;Since Einstein rejects classical ''a priori'' universal and uniform time, his first task is to create a new time concept, and this he undertakes to do with the aid of the light-ray regulation of clocks.  This however, presupposes time relation between distant points in order to identify them and through his reasonings Einstein unconsciously presupposes time in the classical sense.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;''The result is that Einstein''’''s Theory of Relativity is based on the indiscriminate use of the word ''‘''time''’'' in two different meanings which makes his Theory untenable from a logical point of view.''|4=page 120 of ''Relativity, Time and Reality''}}

Nordenson was a member of the upper house of the [[Parliament of Sweden]] from 1938 to 1953, representing the [[Moderate Party#The Rightist Party|National Organization of the Right]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Founded in 1928, the '''Irish Linen Guild''' is a promotional organization of the Irish Linen industry. The Guild's main role is to promote [[Irish linen]] in national and international markets, through its website.
 
The guild's brand's trademark is the focus of all promotional activities. 
This mark is often colloquially referred to as the, 'carpet beater symbol'. It can only be used to mark genuine Irish linen products such as linen yarn spun in [[Ireland]] and linen fabrics woven in Ireland by members of the Guild.
 
Products made from genuine Irish linen fabric, such as garments or table linens can be labelled Irish linen although the made up item may have been assembled elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">'''Jean-Pierre Déricoyard''' (21 July 1907–?) was a Congolese politician and businessman. 

== Biography ==
Jean-Pierre Déricoyard was born on 21 July 1907 to an [[Azande]] family in Bambili, [[Orientale Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. He attended the Ecole Officielle des candidats-commis in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] before studying at the Frères Maristes in 1915. He earned his diploma in 1924 with distinction.{{sfn|Bolamba|1956|p=270}} After six years of work in the colonial administration he served as a clerk for various companies.{{sfn|LaFontaine|1986|p=219}} He later moved to [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]] where in 1949 he established Déricoyard Fréres, a furniture and trade business. Déricoyard rose to prominence in the private sector and his venture became one of the most successful Congolese-owned firms in the capital.{{sfn|LaFontaine|1986|pp=219–20}} At the time he was the only Zande to achieve such status in the region.{{sfn|FASD|1962|p=336}} He eventually became an administrator of a Congolese businessmen [[cooperative]]  and the leader of an ethnic association for people from [[Ituri Province|Ituri]] and the Uélés.{{sfn|LaFontaine|1986|p=219}} Déricoyard also became the president of the Frères Maristes alumni association.{{sfn|Mantuba-Ngoma|Bontinck|2004|p=393}}

In 1956 he participated in a conference organised by the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology]] to discuss the Congolese economy. Two years later he attended the [[All-African Peoples' Conference]] in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] as an observer.{{sfn|LaFontaine|1986|p=219}}{{efn|[[Thomas Kanza]] speculated that he likely went to spy on the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] delegation for the Belgian government.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=49}}}} In April 1959 he founded the Parti Travailliste Congolais, a political party.{{sfn|LaFontaine|1986|p=219}} At his initiative, the organisation urged the colonial administration to hold a [[Round table (discussion)|round table conference]] to discuss the political future of the Congo.{{sfn|Merriam|1961|p=167}}

In the [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|general elections]] of May 1960 Déricoyard won a seat in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Chamber of Deputies]] with 5,509 preferential votes.{{sfn|Bonyeka|1992|p=386}} On 18 December a motion of censure was tabled against Déricoyard in the Chamber of Deputies, who was serving as Minister of Economic Affairs. Three days later the motion was debated by the Chamber. Déricoyard's critics accused him of engaging in corrupt activities in the northeast and failing to do enough to control commodity prices and curtail black market activities. The motion ultimately failed, 30 votes to 57 with 7 abstentions.{{sfn|Bonyeka|1992|p=327}}

'''Joseph Moses Juran''' (December 24, 1904 – February 28, 2008) was a [[Romania]]n-born [[Americans|American]] engineer and management consultant. He was an evangelist for [[Quality (business)|quality]] and [[quality management]], having written several books on those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the brother of [[Academy Award]] winner [[Nathan H. Juran]].

==Early life==
Juran was born in [[Brăila]], [[Romania]], one of the six children born to Jakob and Gitel Juran; they later lived in [[Gura Humorului]]. He had three sisters: Rebecca (nicknamed Betty), Minerva, who earned a doctoral degree and had a career in education, and Charlotte. He had two brothers: [[Nathan H. Juran]] and Rudolph, known as Rudy. Rudy founded a municipal bond company&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{Citation | last = Juran | first = Joseph M. | publication-date = 2004 | title = Architect of Quality: The Autobiography of Dr. Joseph M. Juran | edition = 1 | publication-place = [[New York City]] | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | isbn = 978-0-07-142610-7 | oclc = 52877405 | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}} In 1912, Juran emigrated to [[United States|America]] with his family, settling in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He excelled in school, especially in [[mathematics]]. He was a [[chess]] champion at an early age,&lt;ref name="Bunkley"/&gt; and dominated chess at [[Western Electric]]. Juran graduated from [[Minneapolis South High School]] in 1920.

In 1924, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Minnesota]], Juran joined Western Electric's [[Hawthorne Works]]. His first job was [[troubleshooting]] in the Complaint Department.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|79}}  In 1925, [[Bell Labs]] proposed that Hawthorne Works personnel be trained in its newly developed [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sampling]] and [[control chart]] techniques.  Juran was chosen to join the Inspection Statistical Department, a small group of engineers charged with applying and disseminating Bell Labs' statistical [[quality control]] innovations.  This highly visible position fueled Juran's rapid ascent in the organization and the course of his later career.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|110}}

==Personal life==
In 1926, he married Sadie Shapiro. Joseph and Sadie met in 1924 when his sister Betty moved to Chicago, and  Sadie and he met her train; in his autobiography, he wrote of meeting Sadie, "There and then I was smitten and have remained so ever since." They were engaged in 1925, on Joseph's 21st birthday. Fifteen months later, they were married. They had been married for nearly 82 years when he died in 2008.

Joseph and Sadie raised four children (three sons and a daughter): Robert, Sylvia, Charles, and Donald. Robert was an award-winning newspaper editor, and Sylvia earned a doctorate in Russian literature.

==Department chief==
Juran was promoted to department chief in 1928, and the following year became a division chief. He published his first quality-related article in ''Mechanical Engineering'' in 1935. In 1937, he moved to Western Electric/[[AT&amp;T]]'s headquarters in [[New York City]], where he held the position of Chief Industrial Engineer.

As a hedge against the uncertainties of the [[Great Depression]], he enrolled in [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]] in 1931. He graduated in 1935 and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the Illinois]] bar in 1936, though he never practiced law.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|142}}

During [[World War II|the Second World War]], through an arrangement with his employer, Juran served in the [[Lend-Lease]] Administration and [[Foreign Economic Administration]]. Just before the war's end, he resigned from Western Electric and his government post, intending to become a freelance consultant.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|204–205}}

He soon joined the faculty of [[New York University]] as an adjunct professor in the Department of [[Industrial Engineering]], where he taught courses in quality control and ran [[round table]] seminars for executives. He also worked via a small [[management consulting]] firm on projects for [[Global Gillette|Gilette]], [[Hamilton Watch Company]] and [[Borg-Warner]]. After the firm's owner's sudden death, Juran began his own independent practice, from which he made a comfortable living until his retirement in the late 1990s. His early clients included the now defunct [[Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Company]], the [[Koppers]] Company, the [[ILC Dover|International Latex Company]], [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] and [[General Foods]].

==Japan==
The end of World War II compelled [[Japan]] to change its focus from becoming a military power to becoming an economic one.  Despite Japan's ability to compete on price, its consumer goods manufacturers suffered from a long-established reputation of poor quality. The first edition of Juran's ''Quality Control Handbook'' in 1951 attracted the attention of the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]] (JUSE), which invited him to Japan in 1952. When he finally arrived in Japan in 1954, Juran met with executives from ten manufacturing companies, notably [[Showa Denko]], [[Nippon Kōgaku]], [[Noritake]], and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]].&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|250–257}} He also lectured at [[Hakone]], [[Waseda University]], [[Ōsaka]], and [[Kōyasan]].  During his life, he made ten visits to Japan, the last in 1990.

Working independently of [[W. Edwards Deming]] (who focused on the use of [[statistical process control]]), Juran—who focused on managing for quality—went to Japan and started courses (1954) in quality management. The training began with top and middle management. The idea that top and [[middle management]] needed training had found resistance in the United States. For Japan, it would take some 20 years for the training to pay off.{{synthesis inline|date=June 2012}} In the 1970s, Japanese products began to be seen as the leaders in quality. This sparked a crisis in the United States due to quality issues in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Contributions==

===Pareto principle===
In 1941, Juran stumbled across the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and began to apply the [[Pareto principle]] to quality issues (for example, 80% of a problem is caused by 20% of the causes). This is also known as "the vital few and the trivial many." In later years, Juran preferred "the vital few and the useful many" to signal that the remaining 80% of the causes should not be totally ignored.

===Management theory===
When he began his career in the 1920s, the principal focus in quality management was on the quality of the end, or finished, product. The tools used were from the Bell system of [[Sampling (statistics)|acceptance sampling]], inspection plans, and control charts. The ideas of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] dominated.

Juran is widely credited for adding the human dimension to quality management. He pushed for the education and training of managers. For Juran, human relations problems were the ones to isolate, and [[resistance to change]] was the root cause of quality issues.  Juran credits [[Margaret Mead]]'s book ''Cultural Patterns and Technical Change'' for illuminating the core problem in reforming business quality.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|267}} His book ''Managerial Breakthrough'', published in 1964, outlined the issue.

Juran's concept of quality management extended outside the walls of the factory to encompass nonmanufacturing processes, especially those that might be thought of as service related.  For example, in an interview published in 1997&lt;ref name="Selden 1997"&gt;{{Citation|title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =xxi–xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; he observed:
{{Quote |The key issues facing managers in sales are no different than those faced by managers in other disciplines.  Sales managers say they face problems such as "It takes us too long...we need to reduce the error rate."  They want to know, "How do customers perceive us?"  These issues are no different than those facing managers trying to improve in other fields.  The systematic approaches to improvement are identical. ... There should be no reason our familiar principles of quality and process engineering would not work in the sales process.}}

===The Juran trilogy===
Juran was one of the first to write about the [[cost of poor quality]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergman &amp; Klefsjö (2007), ''Kvalitet från behov till användning'', [[Studentlitteratur]], {{ISBN|978-91-44-04416-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was illustrated by his "Juran trilogy," an approach to [[cross-functional team|cross-functional management]], which is composed of three managerial processes: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. Without change, there will be a constant waste; during change there will be increased costs, but after the improvement, margins will be higher and the increased costs are recouped.

===Transferring quality knowledge between East and West===
During his 1966 visit to Japan, Juran learned about the Japanese concept of [[quality circles]], which he enthusiastically evangelized in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = January 1967 | title = The QC Circle Phenomenon | periodical = Industrial Quality Control | publication-place = [[Buffalo, New York]] | publisher = Society of Quality Control Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also acted as a matchmaker between U.S. and Japanese companies looking for introductions to each other.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|260}}

==Juran Institute==
&lt;!-- Juran Institute redirects here. Any changes to section title should also change the redirect --&gt;
Juran founded the Juran Institute  in 1979. The Institute is an international training, certification, and consulting company that provides training and consulting services in quality management, [[Lean manufacturing]] management and [[business process management]], as well as [[Six Sigma]] certification.  The institute is based in [[Southbury, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juran.com/|title=Management Consulting - Juran Global|work=juran.com|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Juran was active well into his 80s, and gave up international travel only at age 86. He retired at age 90 but still gave interviews. His activities during the second half of his life include:
*Consulting for U.S. companies such as [[Armour and Company]], [[Avery Dennison|Dennison Manufacturing Company]], [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme]], [[Otis Elevator Company]], [[Xerox]], and the [[United States Navy]] Fleet Ballistic Missile System.,&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|276–286}} Steve Jobs. 
*Consulting for Western European and Japanese companies such as [[Rolls-Royce Motors]], [[Philips]], [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Toyota Motor Company]].&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|307–324}}
*''Pro bono'' consulting for Soviet-bloc countries (Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Russia, Poland, and Yugoslavia).&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|313–316}}
*Founding the Juran Institute&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|325–336}} and the Juran Foundation.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;{{rp|337–342}}

==Later life and death==
Juran began writing his memoirs at 92. They were published two months before he celebrated his 99th birthday. He gave two interviews at 94 and 97.

In 2004, at age 100, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Luleå University of Technology]] in [[Sweden]]. A special event was held in May to mark his 100th birthday.

Sadie and he celebrated their 81st wedding anniversary in June 2007. They were both 102 at the time. Juran died of a [[stroke]] on 28 February 2008, at age 103, in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye, New York]]. He was active on his 103rd birthday and was caring for himself and Sadie, who was in poor health, when he died. Sadie died on 2 December 2008, at age 103. They were survived by their four children, nine grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Joseph Juran, pioneer of quality control, dies at age 103 |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=March 1, 2008 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/01/business/NA-FIN-US-Obit-Juran.php |accessdate=April 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314211645/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/01/business/NA-FIN-US-Obit-Juran.php |archivedate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunkley"&gt;{{Citation

{{Companies law}}
A '''limited partnership''' ('''LP''') is a form of [[partnership]] similar to a [[general partnership]] except that while a general partnership must have at least two general partners (GPs), a limited partnership must have at least one GP and at least one limited partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2 = Steven M. |last2 = Sheffrin | title = Economics: Principles in Action| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| year = 2003| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458| pages = 190| isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPs are, in all major respects, in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm: they have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have [[joint and several liability]] for the [[debt]]s of the partnership.

As in a general partnership, the GPs have actual authority, as [[agency law|agents]] of the firm, to bind the partnership in [[contract]]s with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. As with a general partnership, "an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners."&lt;ref&gt;United States [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]] § 402(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of limited liability==
Like [[shareholder]]s in a [[corporation]], limited partners have [[limited liability]]. This means that the limited partners have no management authority, and (unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guarantee) are not liable for the debts of the partnership. The limited partnership provides the limited partners a return on their investment (similar to a [[dividend]]), the nature and extent of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement. General Partners thus bear more economic risk than do limited partners, and in cases of financial loss, the GPs will be the ones which are personally liable.

Limited partners are subject to the same alter-ego [[Piercing the corporate veil|piercing theories]] as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the limited partnership veil because limited partnerships do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the partnership and the members do not co-mingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce the veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.l4sb.com/blog/piercing-the-corporate-veil/ |title=What is "Piercing the Corporate Veil" |last= |first= |publisher= |date=21 May 2015 |website=Law 4 Small Business |access-date=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnership interests (including the interests of limited partners) are afforded a significant level of protection through the [[charging order]] mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor’s share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

When the partnership is being constituted, or the composition of the firm is changing, limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] registration office. Limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties, so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability. It is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited. Hence, unlike the GPs, the limited partners do not have inherent [[Agency (law)|agency]] authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently ''held out'' as agents (and so create an agency by [[estoppel]]); or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority.

Limited partnerships are distinct from [[limited liability partnership]]s, in which all partners have limited liability. In some jurisdictions, the limited liability of the limited partners is contingent on their not participating in management.

==History==
The ''societates publicanorum'', which arose in [[Rome]] in the third century BC, may have arguably been the earliest form of limited partnership. During the heyday of the [[Roman Empire]], they were roughly equivalent to today's [[corporation]]s. Some had many investors, and interests were publicly tradable. However, they required at least one (and often several) partners with unlimited liability.&lt;ref name=Malmendier&gt;Malmendier, Ulrike; ''Societas publicanorum: staatliche Wirtschaftsaktivitäten in den Händen privater Unternehmer ''; Böhlau Verlag; Cologne, FRG;  2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept's roots===
According to Jairus Banaji, the ''[[Qirad]]'' and ''[[Mudaraba]]'' institutions in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic economic jurisprudence|economic jurisprudence]] were similar to the modern limited partnership. In medieval [[Italy]], a business organization known as the ''commenda'' appeared in the 10th century that was generally used for financing maritime trade. In a commenda, the traveling trader of the ship had limited liability, and was not held responsible if money was lost as long as the trader had not violated the rules of the contract. In contrast, his investment partners on land had unlimited liability and were exposed to risk. A ''commenda'' was not a common form for a long-term business venture as most long-term businesses were still expected to be secured against the assets of their individual proprietors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/march06/hansmann_kraakman_squire.shtml ''Law and the Rise of the Firm''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224214019/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/march06/hansmann_kraakman_squire.shtml |date=2007-02-24 }}; 119; Harvard Library; Rev.; Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, and Richard Squire; p. 1333; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As an institution, the commenda is very similar to the qirad but whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Robert H.; ''Limited Liability in Historical Perspective'', "Washington and Lee Law Review," Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colbert's Ordinance]] (1673) and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1807) reinforced the limited partnership concept in European law. In the [[United States]], limited partnerships became widely available in the early 19th century, although a number of legal restrictions at the time made them unpopular for business ventures. Britain enacted its first limited partnership statute in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/forum/issues/119/march06/lamoreaux_rosenthal.shtml ''Entity Shielding and the Development of Business Forms: A Comparative Perspective''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224190251/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/forum/issues/119/march06/lamoreaux_rosenthal.shtml |date=2007-02-24 }}; p. 119; Harvard Library; Rev.

==Regional variations==
:''For a list of types of corporation and other business types by country, see [[Types of business entity]].''

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the limited partnership organization is most common among [[film industry|film production companies]] and real estate investment projects, or in types of businesses that focus on a single or limited-term project. They are also useful in "[[manual labour|labor]]-[[Capital (economics)|capital]]" partnerships, where one or more financial backers prefer to contribute money or resources while the other partner performs the actual work. In such situations, liability is the driving concern behind the choice of limited partnership status. The limited partnership is also attractive to firms wishing to provide shares to many individuals without the additional tax liability of a corporation. [[Private equity]] companies almost exclusively use a combination of general and limited partners for their investment funds. Well-known limited partnerships include [[Enterprise Products]] and [[Blackstone Group]] (both of which are [[Public company|public companies]]), and [[Bloomberg L.P.]] (a [[private company]]).

Before 2001, the limited liability enjoyed by limited partners was contingent upon their refraining from taking any active role in the management of the firm. However, Section 303 of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (if adopted by a state legislature) eliminates the so-called "control rule" with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings limited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.

The 2001 amendments to the [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]] (to the extent the amendments are adopted by state legislature) also permitted limited partnerships to become [[Limited Liability Limited Partnership]]s in states that adopt the change. Under this form, debts of a limited liability limited partnership are solely the responsibility of the partnership, thereby removing general-partner liability for partnership obligations. This change was made in response to the common practice of naming a limited-liability entity as a 1% general partner that controlled the limited partnership and organizing the managers as limited partners. This practice granted a general partner de facto limited liability under the partnership structure.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on this practice and background on the modification of GP liability, see Thomas E. Geau &amp; Barry B. Nekritz, ''Expectations for the Twenty-First Century:  An Overview of the New Limited Partnership Act'', 16 Probate &amp; Property 47, 48-49 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], limited partnerships are governed by the Limited Partnerships Act 1907. The UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (now the [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]]) consulted in 2008 on proposals to modify and merge the Act with the Partnership Act 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51586.pdf |title=The Legislative Reform (Limited Partnerships) Order 2009: Explanatory Document |publisher=UK Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform |date=June 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135622/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51586.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the proposals did not go ahead, and the 1907 Act remains the governing Act.

[[English law]] and [[Scottish law]] are distinct on partnerships. In English law, limited partnerships are not legally separate entities: the partners are jointly and severally liable and any lawsuits filed are filed against the partners by name. There has been discussion over whether limited partnerships operating under English law should be made separate legal entities in the same way as limited liability partnerships are. The [[Law Commission]] report on partnership law [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613041633/http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc283.pdf LC283] suggested that creation of separate legal personality should be left as an option for the partners to decide upon when a partnership is formed. There were concerns that automatically making partnerships separate legal entities would restrict their ability to trade in some European countries and also expose them to different tax regimes than expected.

===Japan===
[[Japanese law]] has historically provided for two business forms similar to limited partnerships:
* ''[[Goshi gaisha]]'', a form of close [[corporation]] (''[[mochibun kaisha]]'') with unlimited liability for certain shareholders
* ''[[Tokumei kumiai]]'' (lit. "anonymous partnerships"), a form of partnership in which non-operating partners have limited liability so long as they remain anonymous

In 1999, the [[Diet of Japan]] passed legislation enabling the formation of {{Nihongo|"limited partnerships for investment"|投資事業有限責任組合|''tōshi jigyō yūgen sekinin kumiai''}}. These are very similar to Anglo-American limited partnerships, in that they adopt most provisions of [[general partnership]] law but provide for limited liability for certain partners. Profits of an investment limited partnership pass through to all partners proportional to their investment share. For tax purposes, profits and losses will only pass through to the general partner(s) while the partnership has [[negative equity]] (i.e. liabilities exceeding assets); however, profits and losses while the partnership has positive equity are shared equally.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], Limited Partnerships are a form of partnership involving General Partners, (who are liable for all the debts and liabilities of the partnership) and Limited Partners (who are liable to the extent of their capital contribution to the partnership). The Limited Partnerships Act 2008 replaces Special Partnerships that exist under Part 2 of the Partnership Act 1908. Special partnerships are considered obsolete as they do not provide the appropriate structure preferred by foreign venture capital investors.

Features of Limited Partnerships include:
* a list of activities that the limited partners can be involved in while not participating in the management of the Limited Partnership (safe harbour activities)
* an indefinite lifespan if desired
* separate legal personality
* tax treatment for Limited Partnerships.

The registers of Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are administered by the New Zealand [[Companies Office]]. Registration, maintenance and annual return filing for Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are conducted through manual forms.

===Germany===
'''Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien''' – abbreviated '''KGaA''' – is a [[Germany|German]] [[corporation|corporate]] designation standing for 'partnership limited by shares', a form of corporate organization roughly equivalent to a [[master limited partnership]]. A [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] auf Aktien has two types of participators. It has at least one partner with unlimited liability (Komplementär). It is in that sense a private company. Komplementärs are [[natural person]]s or [[legal person]]s. If the Komplementär is a corporation with limited liability then the type of the company has to be named as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung#Requirements of formation|UG (haftungsbeschränkt)]] &amp; Co. KGaA'', ''[[GmbH]] &amp; Co. KGaA'', ''[[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] &amp; Co. KGaA'' or ''[[Societas_Europaea|SE]] &amp; Co. KGaA''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sas.ac.uk/amicus/article/view/1229 The German Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien]. Amicus Curae. Accessed April 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Under consideration of the aspects of European freedom of establishment it is also possible that corporations established under foreign law can become Komplementärs of a KGaA forming companies like ''Limited &amp; Co. KGaA''.

The investment of the [[Partnership|partners]] with [[limited liability]] (Kommanditisten) is the stock of the company (Grundkapital) and divided into shares. A KGaA is in that aspect comparable with a German [[Aktiengesellschaft]].

The investment of all partners is the corporate's total capital (Gesamtkapital). The KGaA is a traditional type of very large [[family business]]es (that are partly publicly traded) in Germany; the consumer products giant [[Henkel]] and pharmaceutical company [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] are prominent examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5885211 |title=Company Overview of DORMA Holding GmbH + Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Merck, besides the owning family Merck also the members of the executive board are fully and privately liable for the company (including a period after withdrawal). Also the German football club [[Borussia Dortmund]] uses this corporate organization for its professional football team.

===Denmark===
A [[kommanditselskab]] (abbreviated K/S) is the Danish equivalent of the limited partnership. The owners are divided into general partners (komplementarer in Danish) and limited partners (kommanditister in Danish). Often the only general partner of a K/S is an Anpartsselskab with the least possible capital, thus reducing the liability of the K/S to the capital of the Anpartsselskab.

There is a discrepancy between the 2009 numbers due to the various sources cited; i.e. the units sold by all ODMs add up to 144.3 million laptops, which is much more than the given total of 125 million laptops. The market share percentages currently refer to those 144.3 million total. Sources may indicate hard drive deliveries to the ODM instead of actual laptop sales, though the two numbers may be closely correlated.

[[File:Palencsár Miklós.jpg|thumb|left]]
'''Miklós Palencsár''' (born 1977) is a Hungarian economist, international business strategist, and business mentor. He is the creator and developer of the RISE System, a decision-making process analysis system that analyses and interprets personality and behaviour. The RISE system is capable of scanning and typing the 1 million unique personality compositions, which govern a person’s decision-making processes. His first book, which outlined the basis of the system, was published in 2012.


==Life and career==

Palencsár was born in [[Hungary]]. He graduated from [[Szent István University]] in [[Gödöllő]], Hungary. He started his career at [[Citibank]] where he developed a sales expertise. He completed his multinational career as a strategic leader at [[Trader Classified Media]], and at the age of 28 he started his own strategic consulting firm, 3B (Personality and Behaviour Based Business). In the years since, 3B has become a key player in the business development market. Though he lives and works in various European cities for business development projects, Miklós is currently based in [[Budapest]].


==Business Mentoring==

Palencsár is credited with bringing business mentoring to Hungary. A Business mentor is a business development professional who combines a precise, consultancy project approach with a people-centred approach. As such, by developing the customers, a mentor is able to help them achieve their business objectives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://3bdevelopment.hu/en/business-mentoring/]." Business mentoring.&lt;/ref&gt;


Mentors must not only have a background in business development consultancy but also have the skills required for coaching. In Hungary, the term is not used much in the business world, but it is more and more widespread in Western Europe. Nevertheless, there are more and more forums focusing on this topic, such as interactive discussions and conferences, and nowadays it is not unusual to come across mentors like this at successful companies. Palencsár’s mentoring practice utilises the RISE System.

==3B and the RISE System==

Palencsár used behavioural business theory to create a unique psychological system, the RISE System.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://3bdevelopment.hu/en/rise-system/]." RISE System.&lt;/ref&gt;RISE is the first Europe-based system primed to identify unique personal identities in the business world. RISE’s foundation has been constructed since 2000 with the support of 3B’s international consulting team. Currently, the system is capable of identifying 1 million unique personality compositions and draws from a database of over 1 million client reactions. Its methodology is unique, as the system does not try to verify an abstract psychological theory, but instead advances a theory based on business results. 

Due to the popularity of his business theories, Palencsár is a frequent keynote speaker at prominent business conferences and manager clubs. The Human Hungary conference series was based on 3B’s business theory. Most recently, Palencsár’s theories gave rise to the first Hungarian business developmental magazine, DECISION.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://3bdevelopment.hu/en/decision-magazine/]." ''DECISION'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Palencsár’s first book, ''3B. Behaviour Based Business'', was published in 2012 and has since garnered over 114,000 readers, making it one of the most successful business books in Hungary. Due to the positive response the book received, Palencsár released an electronic version, allowing for easy dissemination abroad. Currently, there are businessmen and businesswomen from 11 countries on 4 continents who have read the book and use the RISE System in their businesses.

Palencsár’s second book, ''Personality and Behaviour Based Sales: Strategy, Management, Methodology'', was published in 2016 and focuses on personality-based sales. The book has become popular among commercial decision-makers because of its insight into the personality’s effect on the sales process.

The material of the books, which are listed under "Modern Business Communication" and "Modern Business Strategy", has become part of the curricula at renowned Hungarian educational institutions.

Palencsár is associated with Hungary’s first business development magazine, a quarterly publication called DECISION. The magazine provides up-to-date information on 3B’s research, the use of the RISE System, and international strategic and trend analysis including strategy, recruitment, and generational research.

==3B Business Development Software==

In 2014, Palencsár and 3B debuted the 3B Business Development software, which draws from the firm’s wealth of business development experience. Its main goal is to simplify the complex process of business development to make it more presentable to businessmen and businesswomen. The software identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the people working at a given company by identifying personality types, emphasising product development, and laying the foundations for business strategy. The software’s international distribution began at the end of 2014. 3B’s is the first software in the world which is suitable for sustained business development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">The '''Minor Metals Trade Association''' ('''MMTA''') is a world-wide industry association whose members are involved in over 49 metals that are not traded on exchanges. The MMTA membership includes around 150 companies from 30 different countries that trade in excess of US$10 billion of [[minor metals]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, G. History &amp; Change: Minor Metals Behind a Modern World. Retrieved March 31, 2010 from {{cite web |url=http://www.mmta.co.uk/about/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412185425/http://www.mmta.co.uk/about/history/ |archivedate=2010-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The MMTA serves to benefit and promote the interests of the international minor metals industry and the MMTA membership, comprising companies actively involved in all aspects of the international trade of these metals in all their various forms. The MMTA does not host a marketplace for minor metals or publish price information.

==History==
The Association was established by London-based metals traders including [[Peter Robbins (British author)|Peter Robbins]] in 1973. It is based in Central London on [[Whitehall Court]]. The MMTA was established to provide clear trading rules for minor metals and to guide and inform the nascent industry.

'''Nelson Lévy''' (born ? - died June 3, 2007 [[Tahiti]]) was a leading figure in French Polynesia [[tourism]] and the founding head of [[Air Tahiti Nui]], the [[national airline]] of [[French Polynesia]].

==Career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tahiti Tourisme Logo.jpg|right|thumb| Levy headed Tahiti Tourisme in the 1990s.]] --&gt;
Levy originally began reporting as a [[journalist]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Pacific&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Nelson Levy, Tahiti Tourism Pioneer, Has Died |url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/06/05/nelson-levy-tahiti-tourism-pioneer-has-died |publisher=[[Pacific News Service]] |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2007-07-23 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Levy soon changed careers and began working in French Polynesia's booming [[tourism industry]].

In January 1992 Levy took over the [[management]] as head of [[Tahiti]] Tourism Promotion Office, which was the French Polynesia's main tourism [[marketing]] and information agency.&lt;ref name=Nui&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title= Air Tahiti Nui Press Release: Nelson Lévy, Founder of Air Tahiti Nui and one of Tahiti's modern tourism pioneers, dies at age 58
|url= http://www.airtahitinui-usa.com/company/presscontent.asp?id=77|work= [[Air Tahiti Nui]] press release |publisher= |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2007-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy helped transform the office into the present day [[GIE Tahiti Tourisme]].&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; [[Tahiti Tourism]] is based in [[Papeete]] and currently operates a worldwide promotional and [[advertising campaign]] called, [[Tahiti and Her Islands]].&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; Levy left Tahiti Tourisme  in August 1998 to become the first [[CEO]] of Air Tahiti Nui.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;

Levy helped found [[Air Tahiti Nui]] in 1996 as French Polynesia's international airline.  The airline  launched its first international  flights in 1998, the same year that Levy became Air Tahiti Nui's first [[CEO]].&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;   Levy helped to guide the international expansion of the airline while CEO and earned a reputation for his managerial efficiency.  As CEO of Air Tahiti Nui, Levy was nominated in 2002 by [[Travel Agent Magazine]] for "Manager of the Year" in the [[Asia Pacific]] region.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt;

Levy was very well connected in the tourism industry, as well as in [[Politics of French Polynesia|French Polynesian politics]].  Levy was a prominent supporter of the [[Tahoeraa Huiraatira|Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party]], a pro-French political party which opposes independence for French Polynesia from [[France]].&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; He was replaced as CEO of the airline when the coalition of pro-independence parties led by [[Oscar Temaru]] took power in a surprise election victory.  However, Levy returned to the board of directors of Air Tahiti Nui following the 2005 presidential election win of French Polynesian President [[Gaston Tong Sang]], a pro-French candidate from the Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; Sang asked Levy back to help revive the ailing airline, which was suffering from "recurrent" financial shortfalls and problems.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; (The [[Government of French Polynesia]] is a 61.7% [[shareholder]] in the airline.)

Additionally, Levy also served as head of the local French Polynesian post and [[telecommunications]] company, OPT.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt;

Levy's last tourism venture was the June 1, 2007, launch of '''easyTahiti.com''' [http://easyTahiti.com], a specialist travel [[web site]] for [[Tahiti]] and other French Polynesian islands.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; EasyTahiti.com has been described as "Tahiti's biggest virtual travel agency" in a [[press release]] from Air Tahiti Nui.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;

==Death==
Nelson Levy died unexpectedly of a [[heart attack]] on June 3, 2007, at his home in Tahiti,&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; just two days after the official [[soft launch|launch]] of easyTahiti.com.  Levy had hosted [[barbecue]] for employees of easyTahiti.com at his home just hours before his death.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; His funeral took place in [[Papeete, Tahiti]] on June 6, 2007.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; Levy was survived by his wife, Vaea, and two daughters, Vaiarava and Poerava.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31868">An '''orphan drug''' is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an [[orphan disease]].

The assignment of '''orphan status''' to a disease and to any drugs developed to treat it is a matter of [[public policy (law)|public policy]] in many countries and has resulted in medical breakthroughs that may not have otherwise been achieved due to the economics of drug [[medical research|research and development]].&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

In the US and the EU, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives, such as an extended period of exclusivity, a time during which that company is the only one allowed to market the orphan drug—all intended to encourage the development of those drugs which might otherwise lack a sufficient [[profit motive]] and market to attract companies' research budgets and personnel.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |format=PDF |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly_2002" /&gt;

==Definition==
An orphan drug is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] which has been developed to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as a [[rare disease]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A rare disease, also referred to as an "orphan disease", is any disease which affects a small percentage of the population. Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203212325/http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No single cutoff number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A disease may be considered rare in one part of the world, or in a particular group of people, but still be common in another.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} As many as one-in-ten Americans suffers from rare disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rare diseases' troubling questions |author=Andrew Duffy|newspaper=Cobourg Daily Star (Ontario) |date=25 January 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global statistics==
{{as of|2014}}, there were 281 marketed orphan drugs and more than 400 orphan designated drugs in clinical trials. More than 60% of orphan drugs were biologics. The US dominated the development of orphan drugs with more than 300 orphan drugs in clinical trial process, followed by Europe. [[Cancer treatment]] was the indication in more than 30% for orphan drug clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Kuick_2014"&gt;{{citation| title=Global orphan drug market to reach US$ 120 billion by 2018|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-orphan-drug-market-to-reach-us-120-billion-by-2018-244195511.html|accessdate=20 March 2014|publisher=Kuick Research|date=7 Feb 2014 |location=New Delhi|format=press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on investment, sales and profit==
According to [[Thomson Reuters]] in their 2012 publication "The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs," there has been increased investing in orphan drug research and development partly due to the U. S. [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]] (ODA) and similar acts in other regions of the world and also driven by "high-profile philanthropic funding."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs |work=Thomson Reuters |year=2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Laura Gaze, Jennifer Breen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513083426/http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.drugdiscoverytoday.com/download/900 |title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Kiran N. Meeking, Cory S.M. Williams, John E. Arrowsmith |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005 |volume=17 |journal=Drug Discovery Today |pages=660–664 |pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the trade journal [[Drug Discovery Today]] between 2001 and 2011 was the "most productive period in the history of orphan drug development, in terms of average annual orphan drug designations and orphan drug approvals."&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012" /&gt;{{rp|660}} For the same decade the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of the orphan drugs was an "impressive 25.8 percent, compared to only 20.1 percent for a matched control group of non-orphan drugs."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}} 
By 2012, the market for orphan drugs was worth USD$637 million compared to the USD$638 million matched control group of non-orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;

By 2012,

{{quote|"the revenue-generating potential of orphan drugs [was] as great as for non-orphan drugs, even though patient populations for rare diseases are significantly smaller. Moreover, we suggest that orphan drugs have greater profitability when considered in the full context of developmental drivers including government financial incentives, smaller clinical trial sizes, shorter clinical trial times and higher rates of regulatory success."|Gaze and Breen 2012}}

According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons: The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases —trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more common diseases with larger numbers of patients. Small clinical trials and little competition place orphan agents at an advantage in regulatory review.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"/&gt;

Tax incentives reduce the cost of development. On average the cost per patient for orphan drugs is "six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power". The cost of per-person outlays are huge and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The 2014 Orphan Drug report stated that the percentage of orphan drug sales as part of all prescription drug sales had been increasing at rapid rate. By 2020 the total was predicted to be $176 billion.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt; Although orphan disease populations are the smallest, the cost of per-patient outlays have been the largest. There pressure on pharmaceuticals which "represent the biggest budgetary drain" has been predicted to increase particularly as more people with rare diseases will be eligible for subsidies —in the United States for example through the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

==Legislation==
Orphan drugs generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], [[dosing]], stability, safety and efficacy. However, some statistical burdens are lessened to maintain development momentum. For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a [[clinical trial|phase III clinical trial]], as fewer than that number may be afflicted with the disease in question.

Since the market for any drug with such a limited application scope would, by definition, be small and thus largely unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies, some governments have chosen to intervene to motivate a manufacturer to develop an orphan drug.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The intervention by government on behalf of orphan drug development can take a variety of forms:
* [[Tax incentive]]s
* Exclusivity (enhanced patent protection and marketing rights)
* Financial research subsidies
* Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development as in a [[Crown corporation]]

A 2015 study of "34 key Canadian stakeholders including drug regulators, funders, scientists, policy experts, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and patient advocates"  investigated contributing factors to the growing interest of the pharmaceutical industry in "niche markets" such as orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="World_Medicine_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World Medicine Health Policy |date= 19 March 2015 |volume=7 |number=1 |pages= 3–27 |doi=10.1002/wmh3.131 |title=Why the Shift?

The [[Orphan Drug Act]] (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the [[United States]], with lobbying from the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] and many other organizations,&lt;ref name=henkel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1999/399_orph.html | last=Henkel | first=John | title=Orphan Drug Law Matures into Medical Mainstay | year=1999 | work=[[FDA Consumer]] | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to encourage [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE4DF1F3EF933A05757C0A966958260 | title=Orphan Drug Law Spurs Debate | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=15 February 2009 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting less than 200,000 American citizens. Under the ODA orphan drug sponsors qualify for seven-year FDA-administered market Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), "tax credits of up to 50% of R&amp;D costs, R&amp;D grants, waived FDA fees, protocol assistance&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"/&gt;{{rp|660}} and may get clinical trial [[tax incentive]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits but it does not mean the drug is safe and effective and legal to manufacture and market in the United States.

In 2002, the [[Rare Diseases Act of 2002|Rare Diseases Act]] was signed into law. It amended the [[Public Health Service Act]] to establish the [[Office of Rare Diseases]]. It also increased funding for the development of treatments for people with [[rare diseases]].&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

===European Union===
In 2000, the [[European Union]] (EU) has enacted similar legislation, Regulation(EC) No 141/2000, which refers to drugs developed to treat rare diseases to as "orphan medicinal products". The EU's definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the USA, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418 |title=Orphan disease definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2002-08-25 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug status granted by the European Commission gives marketing exclusivity in the EU for 10 years after approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerke|first=Sara|last2=Pattinson|first2=Shaun D.|date=2017-02-09|title=EU Marketing Authorisation of Orphan Medicinal Products and Its Impact on Related Research|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718093-12341439|journal=Brill|doi=10.1163/15718093-12341439|volume=24|pages=541–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's legislation is administered by the [[Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products]] of the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).

In late 2007 the FDA and EMA agreed to use a common application process for both agencies to make it easier for manufacturers to apply for orphan drug status but, while continuing two separate approval processes.&lt;ref name="BWN112007"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Legislation has been implemented by Japan, Singapore, and Australia that offers subsidies and other incentives to encourage the development of drugs that treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Windsor"&gt;{{cite news |title=ORPHAN DISEASES A RARE OCCURRENCE: A desperate search for help; County family joins long list with rare diseases in seeking a miracle |author=Andrew Duffy |newspaper=Windsor Star (Ontario) |date=23 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers of new drugs===
Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat [[glioma]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[phenylketonuria]], [[snake venom]] poisoning, and [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Pharmaceitical Executive opines, that the "ODA is nearly universally acknowledged to be a success".&lt;ref name="Executive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pharma's Orphans |author=Armstrong, Walter |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Executive |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Before the [[United States Congress]] enacted the ODA in 1983, only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Daly_2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=House Offers Incentives For Development of 'Orphan' Drugs |author=Rich Daly |newspaper=Congressional Quarterly Daily Monitor |date=5 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, the Office of Orphan Products Development 249 orphan drugs received marketing authorization and granted 1,129 different orphan drug designations, compared to fewer than ten such products in the decade prior to 1983. 
From 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. 
As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

Critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase, claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders which were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation, and whether the ODA has truly  stimulated the production of non-profitable drugs; the act also has been criticised for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit of drugs which have a small market but sell for a high price.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

While the European Medicines Agency grants orphan drugs market access to all member states, in practice, they only reach the market when a member state decides that its national health system will reimburse for the drug. For example, in 2008, 44 orphan drugs reached the market in the Netherlands, 35 in Belgium, and 28 in Sweden, while in 2007, 35 such drugs reached the market in France and 23 in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denis |first1=Alain |last2=Mergaert |first2=Lut |last3=Fostier |first3=Christel |last4=et al|title=Issues Surrounding Orphan Disease and Orphan Drug Policies in Europe |journal=Applied Health Economics and Health Policy |volume= 8 |issue=5 |pages=341 |doi=10.2165/11536990-000000000-00000|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not technically an orphan disease, the research and development into the treatment for [[AIDS]] has been heavily linked to the [[Orphan Drug Act]]. In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the lack of treatment for the disease was often accredited to a believed lack of commercial base for a medication linked to [[HIV]] infection. This encouraged the FDA to use the Orphan Drug Act to help bolster research in this field, and by 1995 13 of the 19 drugs approved by the FDA to treat AIDS had received orphan drug designation, with 10 receiving marketing rights. These are in addition to the 70 designated orphan drugs designed to treat other HIV related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arno|first=Peter S.|last2=Bonuck|first2=Karen|last3=Davis|first3=Michael|date=1995-01-01|title=Rare Diseases, Drug Development, and AIDS: The Impact of the Orphan Drug Act|jstor=3350258|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=73|issue=2|pages=231–252|doi=10.2307/3350258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples for selected diseases==

In the 1980s, people with [[cystic fibrosis]] rarely lived beyond their early teens. Drugs like [[Pulmozyme]] and [[tobramycin]], both developed with aid from the ODA, revolutionized treatment for cystic fibrosis patients by significantly improving their quality of life and extending their life expectancies. Now, cystic fibrosis patients often survive into their thirties and some into their fifties.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Illingworth |first1=Patricia |last2=Cohen |first2=Jillian |last3=Illingworth |first3=P |year=2004 |title=Orphan Drug Policies: Implications for the United States, Canada, and Developing Countries |journal=Health Law Journal |volume=12 |pages=183–200|pmid=16539081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine went to two researchers for their work related to  [[familial hypercholesterolemia]], which causes large and rapid increases in cholesterol levels. Their research led to the development of [[Statins|statin drugs]] which are now commonly used to treat high cholesterol.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

[[Penicillamine]] was developed to treat [[Wilson's disease]], a rare hereditary disease that can lead to a fatal accumulation of copper in the body. This drug was later found to be effective in treating [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt; [[Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate]] is currently under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease.

==Activism, research centers==
The [[Center for Orphan Drug Research]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] College of Pharmacy helps small companies with insufficient in-house expertise and resources in drug synthesis, formulation, pharmacometrics, and bio-analysis.&lt;ref name="Technology"&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrating 25 Years of Orphan Drugs|author=Wechsler, Jill |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Technology |date=July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Keck Graduate Institute]] Center for Rare Disease Therapies (CRDT) in Claremont, California, supports projects to revive potential orphan drugs whose development has stalled by identifying barriers to commercialization, such as problems with formulation and bio-processing.&lt;ref name="Technology"/&gt;

Numerous advocacy groups such as the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], [[Global Genes Project]], Children's Rare Disease Network, Abetalipoproteinemia Collaboration Foundation, Zellweger Baby Support Network, and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance have been founded in order to advocate on behalf of  patients suffering from rare diseases with a particular emphasis on diseases that afflict children.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

==Cost==
According to a 2015 report published by EvaluatePharma, the economics of orphan drugs mirrors the economics of the pharmaceutical market as a whole but has a few very large differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=EvaluatePharma Orphan Drug Report 2015| last=Hadjivasiliou| first=Andreas| publisher=EvaulatePharma| year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for orphan drugs is by definition very small, but while the customer base is drastically smaller the cost of research and development is very much the same as for non orphan drugs. This, the producers have claimed, causes them to charge extremely high amounts for treatment sometimes as high as $700,000 a year, as in the case of [[Spinraza]] (Biogen), FDA approved in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Costly Drug for Fatal Muscular Disease Wins F.D.A. Approval|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/business/spinraza-price.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|agency=New York Times|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing a large amount of stress on insurance companies and patients. An analysis of 12 orphan drugs that were approved in the US between 1990 and 2000 estimated a price reduction of on average 50% upon loss of marketing exclusivity, with a range of price reductions from 14% to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1750-1172-6-62?site=ojrd.biomedcentral.com|title=Estimating the budget impact of orphan medicines in Europe: 2010 - 2020|author=Carina Schey , Tsveta Milanova and Adam Hutchings|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|year=2011|volume=6|issue=62|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have implemented steps to reduce high research and development cost with subsidies and other forms of financial assistance. The largest assistance are tax breaks which can be as high as 50% of research and development costs.&lt;ref name=meek&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Meekings| first=Kiran N.|last2=Williams |first2=Cory S. M. |last3=Arrowsmith |first3=John E.| date=2012-07-01|title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644612000529|journal=Drug Discovery Today| volume=17| issue=13–14| pages=660–664|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005|pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug manufacturers are also able to take advantage of the small customer base to cut cost on clinical trials due to the small number of cases to have smaller trials which reduces cost. These smaller clinical trials also allow orphan drugs to move to market faster as the average time to receive FDA approval for an orphan drug is 10 months compared to 13 months for non-orphan drugs. This is especially true in the market for cancer drugs, as a 2011 study found that between 2004 and 2010 orphan drug trials were more likely to be smaller and less randomized than their non-orphan counterparts, but still had a higher FDA approval rate, with 15 orphan cancer drugs being approved, while only 12 non-orphan drugs were approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kesselheim AS|last2=Myers JA|last3=Avorn J|date=2011-06-08|title=CHaracteristics of clinical trials to support approval of orphan vs nonorphan drugs for cancer|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2011.769|journal=JAMA|volume=305|issue=22|pages=2320–2326|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.769|issn=0098-7484|pmid=21642684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows manufactures to get cost to the point that it is economically feasible to produce these treatments.&lt;ref name=meek/&gt; The subsidies can total up to 30 million dollars per fiscal year in the United States alone {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}.

By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as [[eculizumab]], was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs. Their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines.&lt;ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=How pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drug: Cost of one of world's most expensive drugs shrouded in corporate secrecy |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-pharmaceutical-company-alexion-set-the-price-of-the-world-s-most-expensive-drug-1.3125251 |first=Kelly |last=Crowe |work=CBC News |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Public resources went into understanding the molecular basis of the disease, public resources went into the technology to make antibodies and finally, Alexion, to their credit, kind of picked up the pieces."|Sachdev Sidhu 2015}}

==Public-funding==
===Evaluation criteria===
By 2007 the use of economic evaluation methods regarding public-funding of orphan drugs, using estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness, for example, became more established internationally.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007"&gt;{{citation |authors=Drummond MF, Grubert N. |title=International Trends in the Use of Health Economic Data |location=Waltham MA |series=Spectrum Report, Decision Resources |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The QALY has often been used in [[cost-utility analysis]] to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention.&lt;ref name="NICE_2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp | title=Measuring effectiveness and cost effectiveness: the QALY | publisher=NICE | date=20 April 2010 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nice.org.uk/article/pmg9/chapter/6-the-appraisal-of-the-evidence-and-structured-decision-making | title=Guide to the methods of technology appraisal 2013 | publisher=NICE | date=2013 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, for example, operated with a threshold range of £20,000–£30,000 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008"&gt;{{citation |title=Challenges in the economic evaluation of orphan drugs |first=Michael F |last=Drummond |publisher=World Health Organization |journal=Eurohealth |volume=14 |number= 2 |pages= 16–257 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2005 doubts were raised about the use of economic evaluations in orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007" /&gt; By 2008 most of the orphan drugs appraised had cost-effectiveness thresholds "well in excess of the ‘accepted’ level and would not be reimbursed according to conventional criteria."&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt; As early as 2005 McCabe et al argued&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=McCabe C, Claxton K, Tsuchiya A. |title=Orphan drugs and the NHS |journal=British Medical Journal |year=2005 |volume=331 |pages=1016–19 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007"&gt;{{cite journal  |authors=McCabe C, Tsuchiya A, Claxton K, Raftery J.|title= Assessing the economic challenges posed by orphan drugs: a comment on Drummond et al. |journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care |year=2007 |volume=23 |number=3 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1017/s0266462307071012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond et al&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along than the estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

===Abuse potential===
[[File:Rosuvastatin-Formulae V 1.png|thumb|Rosuvastatin (brand name Crestor) is an example of a drug that received Orphan Drug funding but was later marketed to a large consumer base.]]
The very large incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs have led to the impression that the financial support afforded to make these drugs possible is akin to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simoens|first=Steven|date=2011-06-17|title=Pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs: the need for more transparency|url=http://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|journal= Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|pmc=3132155|pmid=21682893|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their [[profit margin]]. For example [[AstraZeneca]]'s cholesterol drug [[Rosuvastatin|Crestor]] was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric [[familial hypercholesterolemia]]. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

===NICE===

By 2008 if an orphan drug cost more than £30,000{{clarify|reason=30k per patient? For total cost of treatment? Per some time period?|date=July 2015}} the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]] required other arguments for funding.&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt;

In 2015, NICE held consultations with "patient groups, the Department of Health, companies, learned societies, charities and researchers" regarding the appraisal of medicines and other technologies. There was a call for more research into new processes including the &lt;ref name="NICE_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=NICE calls for a new approach to managing the entry of drugs into the NHS |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/nice-calls-for-a-new-approach-to-managing-the-entry-of-drugs-into-the-nhs |date= 18 September 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2015 |work=NICE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ortigas Center''' is a [[central business district]] located within the joint boundaries of [[Pasig]], [[Mandaluyong]] and [[Quezon City]], within the [[Metro Manila]] [[Philippine regions|region]] in the [[Philippines]]. With an area of more than {{convert|100|ha}}, it is [[Metro Manila]]'s second most important business district after the [[Makati CBD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.ph/dti/index.php/about/dti-nationwide |title=DTI Nationwide |publisher=[[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]] |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717051030/http://www.dti.gov.ph/dti/index.php/about/dti-nationwide |archivedate=17 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is governed by Ortigas Center Association, Inc.

Ortigas Center is home to many [[shopping mall]]s, office and condominium [[skyscraper]]s, nightlife bars, [[restaurant]]s and other building complexes. These include the [[St. Francis Square]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] compound, the Oakwood Premier serviced apartments and a [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La]] hotel. It is also the headquarters of [[San Miguel Corporation]], [[Jollibee|Jollibee Foods Corporation]], the Philippine branch of [[HSBC]] and [[Robinsons Galleria]]. Also present in the area are Philippine offices of prominent engineering firms such as [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]], [[Sinclair Knight Merz]], and [[WSP Group]].

It also home to the [[Banco de Oro]] main office owned by mall tycoon [[Henry Sy, Sr.]], as is the [[SM Megamall]] he owns—one of the largest malls in the nation—along EDSA. Also located near the Ortigas Center is [[The Medical City]], one of the three hospitals in the nation accredited by the Joint Commission on International Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/#Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; Ortigas Center is surrounded by the [[street]]s of [[Ortigas Avenue]] to the north, [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue|EDSA]] to the west, [[Meralco Avenue]] to the east, and [[Shaw Boulevard]] to the south.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Ortigas Center began as the 4,033-hectare "Hacienda de Mandaloyon", an estate from the [[Augustinians|Augustinian Order]]. In the following years, there were several changes of partners. Then, on July 10, 1931, the company was incorporated “Ortigas, Madrigal y cia., S. en C.” as a limited partnership by shares ({{lang-es|sociedad comanditaria por acciones}}). The parties to the partnership were Francisco Ortigas (Don Paco), Vicente Madrigal, B.C.M. Johnston, Fulgencio Borromeo, Clyde A. Dewitt and Manuel L. Quezon.

When Ortigas &amp; Company acquired the estate, it was a virtual wasteland. The vision of the management, headed by Atty. Francisco Ortigas Jr., who was President and Chairman at that time, turned it into a progressive industrial, commercial and residential urban complex.

===North Side===
The northern portion of the area is part of [[Quezon City]]. It is situated south of Ugong Norte. The [[EDSA Shrine]] and [[Robinsons Galleria]] is situated here. [[Robinsons Galleria]] is a mixed-use complex composed of two high-rise office towers namely the [[Galleria Corporate Center]] and the [[Robinsons Equitable Tower]], the [[Holiday Inn]] Manila Ortigas and [[Crowne Plaza Manila Galleria Philippines|Crowne Plaza Manila Galleria]], the [[Crowne Plaza Manila Galleria Philippines|Galleria Regency]] and a [[Robinsons Galleria|5-level shopping mall]]. Before [[Robinsons Galleria]],This mall used to be an open land owned by [[Social Security System (Philippines)|SSS]] within Ortigas Center. In 1986, they used the land for the People Power Revolution. In 1987, [[John Gokongwei]] bought the large portion of the land from SSS. It started construction on mid-1988 and finished on late-1989. The mall opened in 1990 being the first mall of [[Robinsons Malls]]. Buildings like the [[UnionBank Plaza]], [[Marco Polo Ortigas Manila]], The [[Robinsons Cyberscape]] are located here, as well as the Famous [[EDSA Shrine]].

===West Side===
The western portion of Ortigas Center is part of [[Mandaluyong City]]. It is in the eastern side of Barangay Wack-Wack Greenhills. Mandaluyong is known for being the "Shopping Capital of the Philippines" because it is home to a cluster of shopping centers which stand side by side. This is where most of the [[shopping malls]] in the area located like [[SM Megamall]], [[The Podium]], [[Shangri-la Plaza Mall]] and [[St. Francis Square Mall]]. It is also proximity to nearby [[Robinsons Cybergate|Robinsons Cybergate Center]]. The [[Asian Development Bank]] Headquarters, The [[Edsa Shangri-La, Manila]], The [[One Shangri-La Place Towers]], [[The St. Francis Shangri-La Place]] and The [[BDO Corporate Center]] are also located here.
 
===East Side===
The eastern portion is part of [[Pasig]] and is where most of the Ortigas Center's [[skyscrapers]] are located. The whole place is politically known as Barangay San Antonio. It is where most of Pasig's financial resources are primarily concentrated. The barangay of San Antonio has the largest income in Pasig, second only to San Lorenzo Village of [[Makati]] as the largest single income-generated government unit in the Philippines. Buildings like The [[Benpres Building]], [[One Corporate Centre]], [[One San Miguel Avenue]], [[Orient Square]], [[Wynsum Corporate Plaza]], as well as the [[Department of Education (Philippines)]] Headquarters, The Tektite Towers, houses the former [[trading floor]] of the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]], and The [[Capitol Commons]] are located here.

==Education==
Among the universities and colleges situated within Ortigas are [[St. Paul College Pasig]], [[University of Asia and the Pacific]], and the [[Saint Pedro Poveda College]]. The [[Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health]] of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] is also located within the financial center. [[Lourdes School of Mandaluyong]] is among the secondary schools within Ortigas. The [[MFI Foundation]] also hosts a vocational school in the financial center.

'''Oscar Benjamin Cintas y Rodriguez''', (31 Mar 1887 in [[Sagua la Grande, Cuba]] &amp;ndash; 11 May 1957 in New York City, N.Y.) was a prominent [[sugar]] and [[railroad]] [[magnate]] who served as [[Cuba]]’s [[ambassador]] to the [[United States]] from 1932 until 1934.

==Career==
He was educated in London and became director of the [[Ferrocarriles de Cuba|Cuban Railroad Company]]’s [[sugar mill]]s in [[Punta Alegre]], [[Jatibonico]] and [[Jobabo]]. He was president of Railroad Equipment of Brazil and Argentina, director of the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] and the [[American Locomotive Company]] and had business interests in Europe.

===Collector===
As a patron of the arts and with the advice of the legendary [[Alfred H. Barr Jr.]], Cintas assembled a collection of [[Old Masters]] and modern paintings that was once considered among the best in [[Latin America]]. In 1940, he lent one of the pieces from the collection, [[Rembrandt]]’s ''[[Portrait of a Rabbi on a Wide Cap]]'', to the "Masterpieces of Art" exhibition at the New York [[World’s Fair]].

'''Bliss Copy'''&lt;br&gt;
Cintas also collected manuscripts and his acquisitions included the only first edition of [[Cervantes]]’ ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and the fifth and final manuscript of [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s "[[Gettysburg Address]]", once owned by the family of [[Alexander Bliss|Col. Alexander Bliss]], and known as the "[[Gettysburg Address#Bliss copy|Bliss copy]]". Cintas’ purchase of the manuscript, for $54,000, in 1949, set a record at the time for the sale of a document at a public auction. Cintas' properties were claimed by the [[Fidel Castro|Castro government]] after the Cuban Revolution in 1959, but Cintas, who died in 1957, willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, provided it was kept at the [[White House]], to where it was transferred in 1959. The manuscript, the only one to which Lincoln added his signature, is exhibited in the [[Lincoln Bedroom]] of the White House.

===Death and estate===
Before his death, Cintas entrusted the administration of his estate, including his art collection, to The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], N.A., with Ethan Alyea serving as legal counsel. With the help and encouragement of [[David Rockefeller]], Alyea named a blue ribbon board of trustees to carry out Cintas’ wishes for a foundation. Early members of the board included Theodore Rousseau (curator of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), Porter A. McCray (director of the International Program at New York’s [[Museum of Modern Art]]) and [[A. Hyatt Mayor]] (curator of prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art).

==CINTAS Foundation==
The foundation’s original name, the Cuban Art Foundation, was changed in 1962 to honor its founder. The Cintas' legacy has fostered the development of Cuban artists, promoting the professional development of these artists and the continuity of Cuban traditions in art. Cintas' foresight has resulted in more than 300 fellowships and grants to creative writers, architects, composers, visual artists and filmmakers, many of whom have later achieved national and international renown. The roster of Cintas fellows is a testament to the talent and creativity of the Cubans and their direct descendants who have live throughout the world. The Cintas Foundation is the oldest entity in the United States dedicated to the support of Cuban artists.

In addition to the fellowships, the CINTAS Foundation oversees two major art collections in the United States and sponsors exhibitions curated from these collections. The CINTAS Fellows collection is composed of works donated by the fellows in appreciation of the CINTAS fellowship. It has grown to be the largest body of Cuban art outside Cuba and continues to grow regularly.

The CINTAS Foundation awards fellowships annually to creative artists of Cuban lineage.

The CINTAS Foundation was established with funds from the estate of Cintas. CINTAS Fellowships acknowledge demonstrated creative accomplishments and encourage the development of creative artists in architecture, literature, music composition and the visual arts. Past recipients include the Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist [[Oscar Hijuelos]], the playwright [[Maria Irene Fornes]], painters Carlos Alfonzo and [[Emilio Falero]], the photographer [[Andres Serrano]], the architect [[Andrés Duany]], the poet [[Silvia Curbelo]], sculptors [[María Elena González]] and [[Rafael Consuegra]], as well as the composer [[Orlando Jacinto Garcia|Orlando Garcia]].

[[File:Pissarro - La cueillette des pois.jpg|thumb|''Picking Peas'', Camille Pissarro, gouache, 1887. Part of the Bauer collection recovered in France in 2017.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;]]

'''Simon Bauer''' (1862–1947) was a Jewish businessman in France and a collector of Impressionist art. His collection was stolen by the Vichy government in October 1943. While some works have been recovered, most are still missing. The Simon Bauer collection included 93 works from the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. Since the [[liberation of France]], some of the canvases have reappeared at auctions or exhibitions in museums.

==Early life==
Simon Bauer was born in 1862 to a humble background. He made a fortune in the footwear business, selling his holdings at the age of 40, at which point he began to travel the world to make up for his lack of education.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt;

==Art collection==
According to the inventory taken at the time of its appropriation on 10 October 1943, Bauer's art collection comprised more than 90 works that included eleven by [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], four by [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], four by [[Eugène Boudin|Boudin]], and one each by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Berthe Morisot]]. The sale was entrusted to a merchant designated by the General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs ({{Lang-fr|Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives}}).

The following year, in the summer of 1944, Bauer was interned at the [[Drancy internment camp]] but saved from deportation and likely death by a railway strike.&lt;ref name=20mins/&gt; He was released in September 1944 and tried to recover the paintings that had been stolen from him, but with little success. Some of them{{Which one|date=January 2018}} are kept in the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, but most have disappeared.

==Death and legacy==
Bauer died in 1947. His grandson, Jean-Jacques Bauer, has attempted to recover his grandfather's paintings. In 1965, he managed to locate two Pissarros but could not get restitution. In 2013, the "treasure of Munich" was found in the hoard held by [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]]. In May 2017, Pissarro's ''Picking Peas'' (1887) was discovered at the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] to whom it had been lent by [[Bruce Toll|Bruce and Robbi Toll]], Jewish-American art collectors, for an exhibition. They had bought the painting in good faith for $800,000 at [[Christie's]] New York in 1995. A French court ordered the painting's restitution to the Bauer family without compensation to the Tolls.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Art collectors ordered to give back looted painting", Adam Sage, ''The Times'', 8 November 2017, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20mins&gt;[http://www.20minutes.fr/paris/2063047-20170506-toile-pissarro-spoliee-pendant-seconde-guerre-mondiale-reapparait-musee-paris Une toile de Pissarro spoliée pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale réapparaît dans un musée à Paris.] 20minutes.fr AFP, 2017.

[[Image:Ideal firm size.PNG|thumb|350px|right|This [[long-run average cost]] diagram shows that as more is produced, so long as output does not exceed OQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, economies of scale are obtained. Beyond OQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, additional production will increase [[average cost|per-unit cost]]s, reflecting diseconomies of scale. Consequently, the societally optimal firm size is OQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where long-run average cost is at its lowest level.]] The '''socially optimal firm size''' is the size for a [[Business|company]] in a given industry at a given time which results in the lowest production costs per unit of output.

== Discussion ==

If only [[diseconomies of scale]] existed, then the long-run average cost-minimizing firm size would be one worker, producing the minimal possible level of output.  However, [[economies of scale]] also apply, which state that large firms can have lower per-unit costs due to buying at [[Bulk sale|bulk]] discounts (components, insurance, real estate, advertising, etc.) and can also limit competition by buying out competitors, setting [[Property|proprietary]] industry standards (like Microsoft Windows), etc.  If only these "economies of scale" applied, then the ideal firm size would be infinitely large.  However, since both apply, the firm must not be too small or too large, to minimize unit costs.

==Variation in optimal firm size by industry==

The "diseconomies of scale" do not tend to vary widely by industry, but "economies of scale" do.  An auto maker has very high fixed costs, which are lower per unit of output the more output is produced. On the other hand, a florist has very low fixed costs and hence very limited sources of economies of scale. Thus there are disparate degrees of economies of scales for different types of organizations.

==Effects of agricultural, industrial, and service-based economies on optimal firm size==

An industrial society will tend to have large firms, as industry has substantial economies of scale.  A service-based economy will favor smaller firms, as services have limited economies of scale.  There will, of course, be exceptions, such as [[Microsoft]], which is a huge services company.  

==Effect of free entry on firm size==
[[File:Perfect competition in the short run.svg|thumb|right|300px| In the short run, it is possible for an individual firm to make an [[economic profit]]. This situation is shown in this diagram, as the price or average revenue, denoted by '''P''', is above the minimum average cost. The firm produces  the quantity '''Q''', at the intersection of marginal cost and marginal revenue]]

[[Image:Economics Perfect competition.svg|thumb|right|300px|After entry of enough other firms has occurred, their increase in market supply has driven down the price of the good, so that [[economic profit]]s of each firm are zero.]]

If the market for a product exhibits [[free entry]], meaning that firms can enter (and exit) the market at will with no logistical, legal, or other inhibiting factors, and if firms have U-shaped long-run average cost curves as in the graphs at the right, then in the long run all firms will end up producing at their point of minimum average cost. For suppose a particular firm with the illustrated long-run average cost curve is faced with the market price ''P'' indicated in the upper graph. The firm produces at the quantity of output where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (labeled ''Q'' in the upper graph), and its per-unit economic profit is the difference between average revenue AR and average total cost ATC at that point, the difference being ''P'' minus ''C'' in the graph's notation. With firms making economic profit and with free entry,  other firms will enter the market for this product, and their additional supply will bring down the market price of the product; this process will continue until there is no longer any economic profit to entice further entrants. The long-run outcome is shown in the second graph, with production by each firm occurring at the newly labelled ''Q'', with marginal cost equalling price at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve, and with the gap between average revenue (the height of the average revenue curve at this ''Q'') and average cost (the height of the average cost curve at this ''Q'') being zero.

Thus with firms possessing U-shaped long-run average cost curves, perfect competition, with (1) firms small enough relative to the overall market that they cannot individually influence the product's market price, and with (2) free entry, leads in the long run to a situation in which no firm is making economic profit, and in which firms are of their socially optimal size (producing at the minimum of their long-run average cost curve).

'''Standard Trading Conditions''' (STC) are standardized terms imposed by some countries for accepting [[cargo]] by shipping lines, airlines and [[logistics]] services providers like [[freight forwarder]]s and customs agents. They are usually printed as the [[Small print|fine print]] behind the shipping documents like [[bill of lading]], air way bill, or [[consignment note]].  These standard trading conditions state the general [[contract]] terms and conditions between the two contracting parties who do a contract of transportation or storage or otherwise handling of goods.

They are often based on the standardized trading rules suggested by [[FIATA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Training Manual on the Operational Aspects of Multimodal Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69bQVEfLetgC&amp;pg=PP16|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-120372-1|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4484">'''Susannah Ostrehan''' (died 1809) was a [[Barbados|Barbadian]] businesswoman who owned a number of properties in [[Bridgetown]]. She was a [[freedman|freed slave]], and acquired a number of slaves herself, many of which were friends or family she purchased in order to expedite their [[manumission]].

==Early life==
Ostrehan was born into slavery. Her mother Priscilla had several other children and was owned by the Ostrehan family, who had been on the island since the 1600s and were prominent members of the [[plantocracy]]. Ostrehan was a [[mulatto]], likely fathered by her mother's owner or one of his relatives. It is unclear at what point she was freed, but it occurred relatively early in her life; her mother and siblings remained enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Kit|last1=Candlin|first2=Cassandra|last2=Pybus|chapter=A Lasting Testament of Gratitude: Susannah Ostrehan and her nieces|title= Enterprising Women:  Gender, Race, and Power in the Revolutionary Atlantic|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2015|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holdings==
===Property===
By 1779, Ostrehan owned two houses in central Bridgetown, one on Reed Street and one on Back Church Street (now Suttle Street). Their tax assessment had increased significantly by the following year, suggesting substantial improvements had been made to the properties. Ostrehan continued to expand her property holdings over the following decades, and even expanded into other colonies – in 1799, she bought two seafront lots in [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital of [[Grenada]], which she had previously been renting.&lt;ref&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no definite evidence of what the properties were used for, but at least some of them were likely to have been hotels or boardinghouses.&lt;ref name=p89&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaves===
As was common for free blacks, Ostrehan dealt in slaves herself once she had the means to do so. Some of the people she owned were family members, including her mother and probably her siblings – she "clearly felt that personal ownership of her family members was the safest option in a society ruled by private property".&lt;ref&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Others she purchased solely in order to free. Barbados had extremely strict [[manumission]] laws at the time, which had been imposed in order to limit the number of free blacks on the island. Owners had to pay £200 for male slaves and £300 for female slaves, and also had to [[Order to show cause|show cause]] to the local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It was often cheaper to manumit in other colonies, and Ostrehan assisted manumissions in [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], and [[Berbice]] at various times.&lt;ref&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of her slaves were kept simply to work on her properties, and no attempts to free them were made before her death.&lt;ref name=p89/&gt;

==Death and estate==
By the time of her death in late 1809, Ostrehan's wealth was concentrated in "two very large houses" in Bridgetown, which were valued at a combined total of £2,850. The total value of her estate was around £4,000, which included several smaller properties, household effects (mahogany furniture, silverware, porcelain), and thirteen slaves.&lt;ref name=p89/&gt; Ostrehan had no children of her own, and willed most of her fortune to her two nieces, Mary and Susannah II.&lt;ref name=p90&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was still enslaved at the time of her death, and thus unable to inherit property; she was willed to a friend, Christian Blackman, with instructions to free her and provide her a house.&lt;ref&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Four white acquaintances received £100 each, demonstrating the extent of her connections in Barbadian society.&lt;ref name=p90/&gt; Ostrehan's nieces carried on the same line of business, operating hotels in the new colonies of [[Demerara]] and [[Berbice]]; Susannah II continued to own slaves up until the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolition of slavery]] in 1833, and received compensation for her loss.&lt;ref&gt;Candlin &amp; Pybus (2015), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Firm's Secret''''' ({{lang-ru|Секрет фирмы}}) is the Russian online magazine about 'entrepreneurs, companies, management insights and applied business problems'. It has been coming out since October 2001.

== History ==
''The Firm's Secret'' was created by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yuri Katsman|ru|3=Кацман, Юрий Маркович|vertical-align=sup}} in October 2001&lt;ref name=forbes2014/&gt; as a monthly supplement to the weekly magazine ''Money'' of the publishing house ''[[Kommersant]]''. The supplement was supposed to cover business seminars held by the publishing house in cooperation with the [[National Research University – Higher School of Economics|Higher School of Economics]] and [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref name=kom-story-2012/&gt; Later, when the publishing house no longer needed the supplement, Katsman and his partners bought out ''The Firm's Secret'' and since September 2002 the magazine came out at first – twice a week, then – weekly. In 2004, a publishing house was established on the basis of the magazine, and also published a newspaper ''Business'' ({{lang-ru|«Бизнес»}}) and magazines ''You have the right'' ({{lang-ru|«Имеешь право»}})  and ''Everything is clear'' ({{lang-ru|«Все ясно»}}). In November 2005, the publishing house ''The Firm's Secret'' purchased an online newspaper ''[[Gazeta.ru]]'' for about $ 7-10 million.&lt;ref name=rbc-2014-11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/17/11/2014/546a0e18cbb20f9d28e34e34|title=ИД «Коммерсантъ» продает журнал «Секрет фирмы»|author=Нина Куриленко|date=17 November 2014|work=РБК|language = Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kom-story-2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/doc/2079241|title= Секретные материалы|author= Юрий Кацман, Максим Котин, Иван Марчук, Елена Локтионова|date=3 December 2012|work=Kommersant|language = Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kommersant ==
Since the spring of 2006, the publishing house was looking for buyers for its unprofitable publications (the revenues of CJSC "The Firm's Secret" (ЗАО «Секрет фирмы») according to Russian Standards of Accountants in 2005 — 216.75 million rubles, net loss — 323.56 million rubles). On December 22, 2006 it was announced that the newspaper ''Business'' was bought by the group ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]''. According to experts, the deal value was about $5-6 million, while in the autumn of the same year ''[[Rodionov Publishing House]]'' planned to buy it for $10-13 million.&lt;ref name=kom-2212&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/732497|title=«Бизнес» достался Гайдамаку|author=Сергей Соболев, Елена Киселева, Тимур Бордюг|date=22 December 2006|work=Kommersant|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, ''[[Kommersant]]'' bought out the remaining newspapers. Former owners – investment fund Cube Capital UK Limited (70%), Alexander Loktev and managing director Yuri Katsman – received approximately $40 million.&lt;ref name=kom-2512&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/733014|title=«Коммерсантъ» снова раскрыл «Секрет фирмы»|author= Юлия Куликова, Сергей Соболев|date=25 December 2006|work=Kommersant|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the new owner closed the magazines ''You have the right'' and ''Everything is clear'', and ''The Firm's Secret'' was transformed into a monthly magazine.&lt;ref name=rbc-2014-11/&gt;

For a long time ''Kommersant'' was publishing two competing publications: ''Money'' and the less popular ''The Firm's Secret'' (the Russian audience of the publications, according to ''[[TNS Russia]]'' for March-July 2014, was 238 thousand and 193,300 people over 12 years old for one issue, respectively).&lt;ref name=rbc-2014-11/&gt; At the same time, the latter had a lower profitability in 2013-2014. It generated a loss while its annual revenue was about 60 million rubles, according to ''[[Vedomosti]]''.&lt;ref name="ved-nov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2014/11/17/ramblerco-nachal-peregovory-o-pokupke-zhurnala-sekret-firmy|title=Rambler&amp;Co хочет приобрести журнал «Секрет фирмы» у «Коммерсанта»|author=Ксения Болецкая,  Екатерина Брызгалова|date=17 November 2014|work=Vedomosti|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rambler&amp;Co ==
In 2014, ''Kommersant'' received an offer from an unnamed company to buy the publication, after a while ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Rambler&amp;Co|ru|3=Rambler&amp;Co|vertical-align=sup}}'' showed interest in the deal. On 14 November 2014 the negotiations between the two holdings began.&lt;ref name=ved-nov/&gt; On December 25, it was announced that the deal has been accomplished.&lt;ref name=forbes2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.ru/news/276619-ramblerco-kupila-zhurnal-sekret-firmy|title=Rambler&amp;Co купила журнал «Секрет фирмы»|date=25 December 2014|work=Forbes|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Vedomosti sources'', ''Rambler&amp;Co'' paid 10 million rubles for the brand ''The Firm's Secret'' and the right to use the electronic archive of the magazine. Then it became known that the December printed issue of the magazine would be the last one&lt;ref name=ved-jan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2015/01/15/rambler-sekretnichaet-onlajn|title=«Секрет фирмы» пополнит список изданий, отказавшихся от бумажной версии|author=Екатерина Брызгалова,  Елена Морозова|date=15 January 2015|work=Vedomosti|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (circulation for November 2014 – 65 000 copies&lt;ref name=ved-nov/&gt;). It was assumed that the publication will keep part of the ''Kommersant'' team. However, Marina Ivanyuschenkova, who had been the editor-in-chief for 13 years, decided not to move to ''Rambler&amp;Co''. At the end of the month it was reported that the publication could be headed by the editorial director of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Look At Media|ru|3=Look At Media|vertical-align=sup}}'', [[Nikolay Kononov]], and that a few people from ''Hopes&amp;Fears'' (an online business newspaper which was closed in July 2014) would move to the new publication along with him.&lt;ref name=rbc-2014-12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/30/12/2014/54a29c119a79473a5f443f70|title=Редакцию бывшего журнала «Секрет фирмы» может возглавить Николай Кононов|author=Дарья Луганская|date=30 December 2014|work=РБК|language = Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2015, Kononov and four key employees of the editorial board moved to ''The Firm's Secret''.&lt;ref name=ved-jan/&gt; Thereafter, the whole team of ''Hopes&amp;Fears'' moved to the new project, except for the chief editor Anna Sokolova and editor Yuri Bolotov.&lt;ref name=runetologia251&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runetologia.podfm.ru/590/|title=Аналитическая программа «Рунетология»: Николай Кононов, главный редактор делового издания «Секрет фирмы»|date=13 May 2015|publisher= Runetologia|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kononov, a series of decisions by the holding management prompted him to quit: first – the merge of ''H&amp;F'' with ''The Village'', which meant closing the business online newspaper that raised a monthly audience of about 800 thousand people in a year and a half, and then – using a successful name for a new English-language lifestyle newspaper.&lt;ref name=kononov-tj&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tjournal.ru/paper/kononov|title=Гость TJ: Николай Кононов|author=Никита Лихачёв|date=20 March 2015|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ved-jan/&gt; The updated editorial staff of ''The Firm's Secret'' did not include journalists from ''Kommersant'', with the only exception of the long-time journalist Nikolay Grishin.&lt;ref name=roem-start&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roem.ru/19-03-2015/188992/secretmag-ru/|title=«Секрет фирмы» перезапустился.

On March 19, 2015, the website was relaunched on the new domain '''secretmag.ru'''. At that time, 14 people worked in ''The Firm's Secret''.&lt;ref name=lentastart/&gt; When launching the newspaper, the editorial board announced plans to release about 20 materials daily. Monetization was planned at the expense of media and contextual advertising, as well as special projects.&lt;ref name=runetologia251/&gt; In February 2016, the publication became one of the websites on which ''Rambler&amp;Co'', together with ''[[MTS (network provider)|MTS]]'', tested paid switching-off of the advertisement.&lt;ref name=adblock-2016-ved&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/02/17/629966-mts-rambler-zapustili-servis-blokirovki-reklami|title= МТС и Rambler запустили сервис блокировки рекламы|author= Елизавета Серьгина|date= 17 March 2016|work=Vedomosti|language=Russian|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VATBox''' is a global cloud-based provider of automated VAT recovery and governance solutions, founded in 2012 by Isaac Saft and Noam Guzman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vatbox#/entity|title=VATBox {{!}} crunchbase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background - VAT Recovery==
In 2014 the [[2013 enlargement of the European Union|EU28]] member states collected €975,901.6&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat|title=Home - Eurostat|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; million of [[Value-added tax|value-added tax (VAT)]], of which billions of corporate VAT are left un-recovered. [[European Union value added tax|VAT recovery in the EU is a complex]], unstructured process that presents multiple challenges for governance and corporate tax officers. Claims are addressed using semi-automated/manual and error-prone processes that are both time-consuming and costly. Failed and incorrect claims result in loss of revenue, lack of financial governance and improper compliance.

== Product - Automated VAT Recovery &amp; Governance==
VATBox automatically detects and recovers VAT – both foreign and domestic - wherever the tax is charged. VATBox's technology - which is part of growing trend in [[Financial technology|FinTech]] and [[Regulatory technology|RegTech]] automation - captures the data and evidence from multiple sources, matches and validates the data, pinpoints any leaks or missing evidence, determines whether it qualifies for VAT recovery, and if it does, then submits the claim. The solution also performs analytics, providing real-time visibility to all ongoing claims both at aggregate and detailed levels.

'''Vasyl Khmelnytsky''' (born 10 September 1966, village of Bayanaul Pavlodar Region Kazakhstan, USSR) — Ukrainian entrepreneur, founder of UFuture Investment Group.

== Biography ==
Khmelnytsky was born in Kazakhstan, in the village of [[Bayanaul, Pavlodar Region|Bayanaul]], Pavlodar Region. His father was a tractor driver, and his mother was a house-painter.

In 1984 he graduated from the technical vocational school majoring in "fitter welder" in the city of [[Vatutine]], [[Cherkasy region]].

In 2002 he graduated from the Faculty of Law of [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]].

In 1987-1991, after a military service in the Soviet Army, he worked as a gas electric welder and a foreman at the construction and assembly department in Leningrad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://file.liga.net/person/300-vasilii-hmelnickii.html Career]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991-1998 he worked as: Head of the Information-Analytical Department at the Orimi Wood Soviet-American Joint Venture (Leningrad), CEO at JSC Danapris, Head of the Information-Analytical Department at JSC Real-Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forbes.ua/magazine/forbes/1360325-kollektivnoe-tvorchestvo Collaborative work]. {{ref-ru}} Forbes Ukraine, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business and investment ==
Vasyl Khmelnytsky began creating his business empire from traditional sectors, such as real estate and infrastructure, later he started investing in pharmaceutical production, renewable energy and high technologies and innovations.

From 2004 to 2008 he extensively invested, buying and selling his own assets. In 2006, an effective sale of a majority stake in the Zaporizhstal metallurgical plant took place. This transaction brought Khmelnytsky $400 million.

Explaining the reasons for the sale of Zaporizhstal, Vasyl Khmelnytsky said: “When I realized that China chose the option of steel production development, it became apparent that before long there would be no place left for anyone else in this business.

In 2013, the Focus magazine estimated Vasily Khmelnytsky’s wealth at $888.6 million (ranked 21st in the 200 Richest People of Ukraine Rating”). In 2015 Forbes ranked Khmelnytsky 35th on Forbes Top 100 Richest with a fortune of $148 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forbes.ua/ratings/1 100 wealthiest - 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315032626/http://forbes.ua/ratings/1 |date=March 15, 2015 }} {{ref-ru}} Forbes Ukraine, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rating of the Korrespondent magazine he takes 73rd place on the list of the most influential people of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.ua/ratings/321999/ 100 most influential Ukarinians-2014] {{ref-ru}} Focus Magazine, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 he became Vice-President in the Ukrainian League of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (ULIE). Since 2015 he began to work as the First Vice President of ULIE.

At the European Business Summit on June 2, 2016, Vasyl Khmelnytsky presented a strategy for the development of Ukrainian regions exemplified by [[Bila_Tserkva|Bila Tserkva]], until 2025. The project involves attracting $ 250 million investment, creating seven thousand jobs, an industrial park, a technological cluster and a business incubator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kfund.ua/model-sotsialno-ekonomicheskogo-razvitiya-ukrainskih-regionov-byla-predstavlena-na-evropejskom-biznes-sammite The model of social and economic development of the Ukrainian regions has been presented at the European business summit]{{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2016 in Beijing, he took part in establishing the Belt &amp; Road Industrial and Commercial Alliance (BRICA).

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«We always preferred working in partnership. We believe that this reduces risks and increases revenue. Almost in all projects from 25% to 60% belongs to our partners»'' – V. Khmelnytsky, Kommersant Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2241281 Vasyl Khmelnytsky: we are ready to invest hundreds of millions in building projects] {{ref-ru}} Kommersant Ukraine, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

“It is our intention that our partners view our country not only as a transit zone for the supply of goods to Europe, but also as a platform for the creation of new industries”, said Vasyl Khmelnytsky, the First Vice President of ULIE, in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zn.ua/ECONOMICS/ukrainskiy-biznes-prisoedinilsya-k-alyansu-s-kitaem-216638_.html The Ukrainian business has joined alliance with China]{{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ULIE Vasyl Khmelnytsky supervises the promotion of the investment potential of Ukraine, in particular, the attraction of foreign capital and solutions and the development of regional projects. He is a proponent of construction of new modern industrial production entities and creation of industrial parks in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gazeta.ua/ru/articles/economics/_vasilij-hmelnickij-postroit-industrialnyj-park-v-beloj-cerkvi/699933 Vasyl Khmelnytsky will build the industrial park in Bila Tserkva]{{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“When the country’s economy starts to grow, all assets, including mine and other businessmen’s, will become more costly. We will become richer. This is the business model; people are not aware that the projects are not created for profit here and now. Our projects have longer than a ten-year horizon”, stated Vasyl Khmelnytsky.

He is the majority shareholder at the UDP company. As of 2018, the UDP company has launched construction projects with an area of more than 3 million square meters and has become one of the largest real estate developers and infrastructure enterprises in the country. Among its most famous projects are the construction of Ocean Plaza Mall, Novopecherski Lypky, Boulevard of Fountains, RiverStone and Parkove Misto residential complexes.

In addition to UDP, the group owns or operates Igor Sikorsky [[Kyiv International Airport]] (Zhuliany), the RTM-Ukraine Group, Ukrainian national operator of outdoor advertising, and Bila Tserkva industrial park.
Apart from commercial projects, Vasyl Khmelnytsky supports numerous social initiatives in the fields of education and economy whose objective is to promote Ukraine’s competitiveness in world markets, for example, UNIT.City and LvivTech.City innovation parks, the unique educational UNIT Factory (Ukrainian National IT Factory); Osvitoriya public organization projects: Novopechersky school (comprehensive school) in Kyiv and iLearn online platform for orphans and children from low-income families; K.Fund Books publishing project; Small and Medium Entrepreneurship School (SME School), Lean Institute Ukraine (LIU) and K.Fund Media as information resource about new opportunities.

Vasyl Khmelnytsky is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at National Technical University “[[Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute]]”. "Every year, our top managers and I visit the world top universities and the most innovative companies to adopt the unrivalled expertise and breakthrough approaches and apply them in Ukraine”, he notes. The entrepreneur is sure that only education and a different way of thinking of Ukrainian citizens can speed up the country’s development, helps achieve prosperity and take a proper place in the modern world.

In 2017, the Ukrainian journal Novoye Vremya placed him on Top 100 Richest Ukrainians at 36th place with $114 million.

As of July 2018, the value of assets belonging to the Ufuture Investment Group was $750 million.

== Political Activity ==
Khmelnytsky was a people’s deputy of five convocations. He was elected to the parliament for the first time in 1998, representing the Party of Greens of Ukraine. During his tenure, he was a member of the [[Yuliya Tymoshenko Bloc]] (YTB) parliamentary faction and the Party of Regions. He completed his political activities as a member of the Sovereign European Ukraine deputy group.

1997
* "Most Group" consolidated all its media assets in a new entity - [[:ru:Медиа-Мост|"Media Most"]]. Gusinsky resigned from his positions in "Most Group" and "Most Bank", became president of "Media Most", and focused all his efforts on the development of the media business.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* The new media holding company included [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], [[TNT (Russian TV channel)|TNT]], [[NTV Plus]], [[Echo of Moscow|Echo Moscow]], [[:ru:Семь дней (издательский дом)|Publishing house Seven Days]], other radio stations, internet development companies, movie studios and media design companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Implications of Vladimir Gusinsky’s Arrest|url = http://carnegieendowment.org/2003/09/04/implications-of-vladimir-gusinsky-s-arrest/2ur3|website = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[:ru:Медиа-Мост|"Media Most"]] was the largest media holding in Russia and, based on the number of viewers and readers, possibly one of the largest in Europe. Gusinsky was hailed as the "[[Rupert Murdoch]]" of Russia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* While Gusinsky never participated in [[Privatization in Russia|privatization]] – all his assets were created from scratch, in ’97 Gusinsky made his first, and last, attempt at [[Privatization in Russia|privatization]] – he bid for the privatizing of the state owned telecommunication giant [[Svyazinvest]]. The bid ended unsuccessfully for Gusinsky, and many commentators have accused Gusinsky of using his media assets to influence his bid and it resulted in a large public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TV Mogul Gusinsky Did Bid for Svyazinvest {{!}} News|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1997/7/article/tv-mogul-gusinsky-did-bid-for-svyazinvest/303307.html|website = The Moscow Times|accessdate = 2015-10-15|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160601040941/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1997/7/article/tv-mogul-gusinsky-did-bid-for-svyazinvest/303307.html|archive-date = 1 June 2016|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ’[[1997 Asian financial crisis|97 Asian Economic Crisis]] severely impacted the Russian economy in ’98.

* Subsequently, in order to continue "Media Most" development and in anticipation of an economic rebound following [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russia's default]], "Media Most" received a credit from [[Credit Suisse First Boston]], guaranteed by [[Gazprom]].

== Confrontation with Kremlin ==
1999
* An alliance that included President [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]], Yeltsin's relatives, and a group of powerful businessman, publicly known as the "Family",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Spark : Russia: Yeltsin, "The Family" and the Bureaucratic Mafia|url = https://the-spark.net/csart264.html|website = the-spark.net|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought in Vladimir Putin as the successor to President Yeltsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yeltsin keeps it all in 'The Family' [On the rise of Vladimir Putin]|url = http://www.iwp.edu/news_publications/detail/yeltsin-keeps-it-all-in-the-family-on-the-rise-of-vladimir-putin|website = www.iwp.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Gusinsky positioned himself outside of the "Family" and as a result he was accused of supporting the election of anti-Kremlin alliance of [[Primakov]] &amp; [[Yury Luzhkov|Luzhkov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pushing the Boundaries of a Free Press|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/01/news/mn-36319|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2000-06-01|access-date = 2015-11-16|issn = 0458-3035|first = ROBYN|last = DIXON}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the conflict between Gusinsky, the Family, and Putin.
* In September of ‘99 there were a number of [[Russian apartment bombings|terrorist attacks in Moscow and other cities in Russia]]. Several buildings were bombed and many people were killed. The [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] took the position that Chechen separatists were responsible for the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Re-examining the 1999 apartment bombings in Russia {{!}} The Stanford Post-Soviet Post|url = http://postsovietpost.stanford.edu/discussion/re-examining-1999-apartment-bombings-russia|website = postsovietpost.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-16|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025702/http://postsovietpost.stanford.edu/discussion/re-examining-1999-apartment-bombings-russia|archive-date = 17 November 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, a group of neighbors residing in an apartment building found a large quantity of explosives in the basement of their building, and reported it to [[Federal Security Service|FSB]].

Gusinsky refused to end the investigation. Furthermore, a number of independent commentators accused the Kremlin and Putin of organizing the explosions, prompting the new Chechen war, with the goal of increasing Putin's popularity in anticipation of elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Blowing Up Russia: The Secret Plot to Bring Back KGB Terror|last = Litvinenko|first = Alexander|publisher = Encounter Books|year = 2007|isbn = 1594032017|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the breaking point in the relationship between Gusinsky and the Kremlin, the Family, and Yeltsin's successor Putin.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

* With the Yeltsin's resignation bringing Putin to Acting Presidency, and the subsequent election in May 2000 that brought Putin to power, one of the first publicly criticized acts of new president Putin was the commencement of an investigation against Gusinsky with the goal of putting [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] under government control and effectively silencing the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1.

Even with this settlement agreement being signed by Gusinsky under a threat of arrest and extradition, Gazprom conceded that Media Most's assets were fairly valued in excess of 1.1 billion [[United States dollar|USD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Auditors Question Worth of Media-MOST {{!}} Business|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/tmt/258571.html|website = The Moscow Times|accessdate = 2015-11-16|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117043650/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/tmt/258571.html|archive-date = 17 November 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* However, ignoring the settlement agreement, and ignoring the [[Interpol]] head office's refusal to issue the international arrest warrant (due to suspected political motivations for arrest), the Russian local branch of [[Interpol]] circumvented the head office's refusal, went directly to the Spanish local branch of [[Interpol]] and requested it to detain and extradite Gusinsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Implications of Vladimir Gusinsky’s Arrest|url = http://carnegieendowment.org/2003/09/04/implications-of-vladimir-gusinsky-s-arrest/2ur3|website = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian Media Mogul Arrested in Spain; Moscow Seeks Extradition|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/13/news/mn-64881|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2000-12-13|access-date = 2015-11-16|issn = 0458-3035|first = JOHN|last = DANISZEWSKI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Political Developments in Contemporary Russia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gMKj1NkvteoC|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 2011-03-07|isbn = 9781136849657|first = Ian|last = Jeffries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12 December, Gusinsky was arrested in Spain based on the Russian request.

* 22 December, Justice [[Baltasar Garzón|Balthazar Garzon]] released Gusinsky from prison and places him under house arrest in Gusinsky's home in southern Spain. The decision to release Gusinsky was strongly criticized in Spain, and was appealed by prosecution, as it is uncommon for a foreigner facing extradition to be released and placed under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Gusinsky freed on bail|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1083393.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2000-12-22|access-date = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian Mogul Gusinsky Released From Jail in Spain|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/23/news/mn-3926|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2000-12-23|access-date = 2015-11-16|issn = 0458-3035|first = From|last = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001
* In January, Gusinsky filed a case against Russia in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for violations of his rights and freedoms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|url = http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-61767|website = hudoc.echr.coe.int|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Only days after the National Court of Spain decided that charges against Gusinsky were politically motivated and not a crime, the Russian Federation commenced new criminal proceedings against Gusinsky and issued a new arrest warrant, alleging [[money laundering]] of money owed to [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Russia: Gusinsky Laundered $100M {{!}} News|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russia-gusinsky-laundered-100m/253820.html|website = The Moscow Times|accessdate = 2015-11-19|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120085904/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russia-gusinsky-laundered-100m/253820.html|archive-date = 20 November 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again the Russian Federation submitted the request to arrest Gusinsky in his home in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CNN.com - Russia issues new Gusinsky warrant - April 25, 2001|url = http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/04/25/spain.gusinsky.02/|website = www.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Gusinsky was not present – he left for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian tycoon flees to Israel|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1295963.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2001-04-25|access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Media Mogul Sought by Russia Leaves Spain|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/26/news/mn-56042|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2001-04-26|access-date = 2015-11-19|issn = 0458-3035|first = From Associated|last = Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russia: Gusinsky Takes Refuge In Israel|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1096282.html|newspaper = RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|date = 2001-04-25|access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later the National Court of Spain dismissed the Russian Federation's new request as baseless.
* In July, the supervisory board of [[Interpol]] recommended to stop any further actions against Gusinsky based on Russian Federation requests. Interpol's secretary general, [[Ronald Noble]], described the case against Gusinsky as having "predominantly political character". In August, Israel refused to extradite Gusinsky to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTERPOL CHIEF SAYS THE CASE AGAINST GUSINSKY IS POLITICAL...|url = http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=23285&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=215&amp;no_cache=1#.VkoUm6IqT1w|website = The Jamestown Foundation|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian tycoon held in Athens|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3176219.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2003-08-24|access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Putin's former tormentor held in Athens|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putins-former-tormentor-held-in-athens-101872.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2002
* In May, Gusinsky started a new television project – RTV International or [[RTVi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RTVi — телеканал, говорящий на весь мир по-русски|url = http://rtvi.com/|website = rtvi.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continued what NTV International started – providing unbiased Russian language news for Russian speakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Russians are Here!: Russian TV in America|url = http://ari-kagan.blogspot.com/2009/02/russian-tv-in-america.html|website = The Russians are Here!|date = 2009-02-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = For Russian television shows, independence is the exception|url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-09-06/news/0309060228_1_norkin-network-russia|website = tribunedigital-baltimoresun|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October, Gusinsky's internet news project [http://Newsru.com Newsru.com], started operating on its new domain name. Prior to this, the project was operating as NTV.ru, but that domain name was given to [[Gazprom-Media|Gazprom Media]], the new owners of NTV. The design for the website was created by an internationally recognized designer: [[:ru:Левин, Семён Михайлович|Semyon Levin]]. Newsru.com included a highly acclaimed internet resource – [http://inopressa.ru/ Inopressa.ru] – that provided summaries of daily news from foreign print media translated into the Russian language. Currently, the Newsru.com website has more than 65 million page views and 7.5 million unique visitors monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = site statistics "NEWSru.com: самые быстрые новости.

2004
* In May 2004, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held that the arrest and criminal charges against Gusinsky were in violation of Article 5 and Article 18 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention on Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms]], stating that the facts of the case established that the prosecution of Gusinsky in Russia was politically motivated and used to intimidate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Court of Human Rights condemns Russia in media case  - Committee to Protect Journalists|url = https://cpj.org/2004/05/european-court-of-human-rights-condemns-russia-in.php|website = cpj.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Rights Court Sides With Gusinsky {{!}} News|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/2004/5/article/human-rights-court-sides-with-gusinsky/230870.html|website = The Moscow Times|accessdate = 2015-11-19|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120082749/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/2004/5/article/human-rights-court-sides-with-gusinsky/230870.html|archive-date = 20 November 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Court of Human Rights Rules in favor of Gusinsky in suit vs. Russia|url = http://www.pravdareport.com/news/world/20-05-2004/57196-0/|website = PravdaReport|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Federation appealed.

2005
* Gusinsky consolidated his television production operations into a new holding company named [https://web.archive.org/web/20160110164359/http://newmediadistribution.com/ New Media Distribution Company].

* In December, Gusinsky created a sister site to [http://Newsru.com Newsru.com], called [http://www.Newsru.co.il Newsru.co.il]. While it had an independent editorial board, it retained a similar design as the Russian counterpart. The Israeli site provided Russian language news about Israel's domestic and international affairs as well as world news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NEWSru.co.il :: Новости Израиля и мира.

2007
* In first quarter of 2007, Gusinsky decided to create a general entertainment television channel in Ukraine. Gusinsky started to work with an acquaintance, [[Konstantin Kagalovsky]], to jointly bring the Ukrainian TV project to life.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nylawyer.nylj.com/adgifs/decisions/082212ramos.pdf|title = Judgement|last = Ramos|first = Charles Edward|date = 16 August 2012|journal = Supreme Court of the State of New York, Commercial Division|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April, Gusinsky opened a new sister internet project, this time in Ukraine – [https://web.archive.org/web/20151119154106/http://newsru.ua/ Newsru.ua], similar to the Russian and Israeli sites, it had an independent editorial board but retained the design, and provided news about Ukrainian's domestic and international affairs and world news.

2008
* In March, Gusinsky and Kagalovsky jointly put the general entertainment channel in Ukraine on air, naming it [[TVi (TV channel)|TVi]]. [[TVi (TV channel)|TVi]] was quickly and steadily rising in both coverage and popularity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gusinsky, Kagalovsky launch Ukraine cabler|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gusinsky-kagalovsky-launch-ukraine-cabler-111957|website = The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2009
* In the spring, Gusinsky and Kagalovsky began to have disputes about the direction [[TVi (TV channel)|TVi]] was taking.

* In August, Gusinky won a judgement against Kagalovsky and his companies for theft of TVi in an amount of over US$30 million.

==Other investments==
Gusinsky had a shareholding in the [[Hapoel Tel Aviv B.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] [[basketball]] team for a period of three and a half years, acquiring 60% of the team in November 2000.

Until November 2008, Gusinsky held 27% of the shares in the prominent Israeli second largest newspaper [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]], which he exchanged with Bank Hapolaim to settle a debt to the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Maariv'' editors in chief quit over budget discords |publisher=''Haaretz'' |date=12 May 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1084850.html }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
