''''' Annunciation of Fano''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1488-1490, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy.

The work was successful, and a few years later he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the same church, the [[Fano Altarpiece]].

==Description==
The painting is set within a four bay portico, a common element in Perugino's paintings from the 1480s (as, for example, in the [[Albani-Torlonia Polyptych]] and the ''[[Pietà (Perugino)|Pietà]]''). Behind it, is a background with hills featuring light trees.

In the foreground is the [[Annunciation]], lit from the left. The angel, holding a white lily (symbol of purity), announces that she will bear Jesus; Mary, who was previously reading a book on a classical altar in front of her, has a surprised face. Behind them, in the upper center, is God in an oval with cherubim and seraphim, sending the Holy Spirit (portrayed as a dove) to her.

[[Image:Apollo Musagetes Pio-Clementino Inv310.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apollo Citharoedus in the Vatican]]
'''Apollo Citharoedus''' (Cithara-playing Apollo), also known as '''Apollo Musagetes''' ("Apollo, Leader of the Muses") is a 2nd-century AD colossal marble statue of [[Apollo]] by an unknown Roman artist.  It is a major example of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type.

Apollo is here crowned with laurel and wears the long, flowing robe of the Ionic bard. 
The statue was found with seven statues of the [[Muses]] near [[Tivoli, Italy]], in 1774, in the ruins of [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]]' villa, and is now preserved in the Hall of the Muses, standing along with the seven statues in the Museo Pio-Clementino of the [[Vatican Museums]].

'''Azalea Thorpe''' (10 April 1911 – 29 December 1988) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-born American weaver and textile designer. Known for her innovative experimentation with both natural and synthetic materials, Thorpe was a featured instructor and lecturer throughout the United States. She has [[weaving]]s in the permanent collection of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. An annual award given in her honor is presented by the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] for fiber arts.

==Early life==
Azalea Stuart Gray was born on 10 April 1911 on her family's estate, "Blinkbonnie", in [[Peebles]], Scotland to Marion R.

S. Census|1920|p=13-A}} After the family arrival, another daughter, Marcia was born. The girls attended public schools in Flint and at the age of eighteen, Gray was working in the automobile industry.{{sfn|''The Santa Fe New Mexican''|1989a|p=4}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1930|p=3-A}} By the mid-1930s, she had married Alfred E. Thorpe, moved to Ohio and in 1937, the couple had their daughter, Sheila.{{sfn|''The Santa Fe New Mexican''|1989a|p=4}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1940|p=63-B}} After Thorpe divorced, she moved to Europe, where she traveled extensively and studied French for eighteen months. Returning to the United States, she enrolled in a textile design course at [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in [[Bloomfield Hills]], Michigan,{{sfn|''The Santa Fe New Mexican''|1989a|p=4}} studying with [[Marianne Strengell]].{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=14}}

==Career==
Upon her graduation from Cranbrook, Thorpe began teaching weaving techniques and by 1953, was conducting a speaking tour with exhibits on weaving.{{sfn|''The Indianapolis Star''|1953|p=7}}{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=16}} After several years of teaching at Cranbrook, she moved to [[Deer Isle, Maine]], where she taught at the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] before moving to New York City around 1953.{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=14}} In New York, Thorpe opened a design studio in [[Manhattan]] at 10th Avenue and [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]],{{sfn|''The Santa Fe New Mexican''|1989a|p=4}} where she experimented with a range of both natural and synthetic fibers.{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=16}} She continued with her own education at the [[Scottish Woollen Technical College]] in [[Galashiels]], Scotland and taught at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Adams|1961|pp=14, 16}}

Thorpe was interested in textile manufacture for both industrial and home use. She designed fabrics for use in coats, drapery, rugs, and wall coverings as well as a special fabric for use with [[Loudspeaker|speakers]] which would not distort the transmission of sound.{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=16}}{{sfn|''The Fort Lauderdale News''|1958|p=7}} She participated as a technical advisor, along with [[Jack Lenor Larsen]] and [[Russel Wright]], to the [[International Cooperation Administration]].{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=16}} She was interested in varied [[dyeing]] techniques and conducted in-depth research on new types of materials, such as the natural protein fiber ''Vicara''{{sfn|''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal''|1959|p=51}}{{sfn|Kulp|Ponte Jr.|2000|p=737}} and corn fiber to determine its adaptability for both design and manufacture. Her research was conducted as a collaboration with the architect Kent Cooper.{{sfn|''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal''|1959|p=51}} Displaying her work at craft fairs and exhibitions,{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=16}} in varied locations like Texas and Florida,{{sfn|''The Fort Lauderdale News''|1958|p=7}}{{sfn|''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal''|1959|p=51}} she also juried events for the National Conference of American Craftsmen and the annual International Women's Exhibition, among others.{{sfn|Adams|1961|p=16}}{{sfn|''Adirondack Record Elizabethtown Post''|1959|p=1}}

In addition to her design work, Thorpe, who was a [[jazz]] enthusiast, wrote as a columnist at ''[[Downbeat Magazine]]''. Meeting many of the noted musicians in the field, she worked as a personal manager for such artists as the De Paris Brothers, [[Sidney De Paris|Sidney]] and [[Wilbur de Paris|Wilbur]]; [[Miles Davis]]; and [[Abbey Lincoln]].{{sfn|''The Santa Fe New Mexican''|1989a|p=4}} She exhibited works at the [[Brussels World Fair]] in 1958 and toured Europe with the United States Information Service Exhibit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3521">'''Bernhard Alexander''' (1850–1927) was a Hungarian writer of Jewish background, and a professor of philosophy and [[esthetics]].

==Life and career==
Bernhard (Bernát) Alexander was born '''Alexander Márkus''' in [[Budapest|Pest]]&lt;ref&gt;The cities of Buda and Pest and the town of Óbuda were merged as the city of Budapest in the fall of 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; on 13 April 1850, and educated in his native city, later attending German universities, where he pursued studies in the fields of [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]] and [[pedagogy]]. On his return to Hungary he was appointed to a teaching post in a ''[[Realschule]]'' (scientifically oriented high school) in Budapest, and in 1878 was admitted as a docent into the faculty of philosophy at the [[University of Budapest]], where he became a full professor in 1895. From 1892, he also lectured on [[dramaturgy]] and esthetics at the National Theater Academy, and on the latter subject and on the history of civilization at the Francis Joseph Polytechnic. He was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and a member of the [[Kisfaludy Society]], a major force in Hungarian literature. He was the father of [[Franz Alexander]], a Hungarian-American psychoanalyst and physician, who is considered one of the founders of psychosomatic medicine and psychoanalytic criminology, and maternal grandfather of [[Alfréd Rényi]], a Hungarian mathematician who made contributions in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory but mostly in probability theory.

==Works==
Alexander's chief works are ''A philosophia történetének eszméje, tekintettel a történetre általában'' (The idea of the history of philosophy, in consideration of history in general, 1878); ''[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Élete, fejlődése és philosophiája'' (Life, development and philosophy, 1881); ''A XIX. század pesszimizmusa: [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] és [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Hartmann]]'' (The pessimism of the 19th century: Schopenhauer and Hartmann, Budapest, 1884, prize essay). Alexander, together with Professor Józef Bánóczi, later edited a seminal series of books on philosophers, the ''Filosofiai Irók Tára'', for which he did translations and annotations of [[René Descartes]], [[David Hume]], and the ''[[Prolegomena]]'' to [[Immanuel Kant]]. Jointly with Bánóczi, he translated Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''. He was an active writer on matters of education, editing the pedagogical journal ''Magyar Tanügy'' from 1882 to 1886.

==Exile and death==
However, Alexander became pariah in the nationalistic, anti-Semitic environment of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|post-1919 Hungary]] and [[Miklós Horthy|Miklós Horthy's government]], and spent four years abroad. He died in Budapest in 23 October 1927.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12958">'''Beth Alpha''' ({{Lang-he|בית אלפא}}; ''Bet Alpha'', ''Bet Alfa'') is a sixth-century AD [[synagogue]] located at the foot of the northern slopes of the [[Mount Gilboa|Gilboa]] mountains near [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190"&gt;Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 190.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now part of '''Bet Alfa Synagogue National Park''' and managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Beit Alfa Synagogue National Parks Website, {{cite web|url=http://www.parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat%3D%7E25%7E%7E440441034%7ECard12%7E%26ru%3D%26SiteName%3Dparks%26Clt%3D%26Bur%3D204968785 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601082424/http://www.parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat=~25~~440441034~Card12~&amp;ru=&amp;SiteName=parks&amp;Clt=&amp;Bur=204968785 |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Beit alfa panorama2.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Nave Mosaics|500px]]

==Excavations==
The Beth Alpha synagogue was uncovered in 1928 by members of the nearby [[Kibbutz]] [[Hefzibah]], who stumbled upon the synagogue's extensive mosaic floors during irrigation construction.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; Excavations began in 1929 under the auspices of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and were led by Israeli archaeologist, [[Eleazar Sukenik]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190"/&gt; A secondary round of excavations, sponsored by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] in 1962, further explored the residential structures surrounding the synagogue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt;

In addition, a [[hoard]] of 36 Byzantine coins were found in a shallow depression in the floor [[apse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winter |first1=Dave |last2=Matthews |first2=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxYEsYsrfGUC |title=Israel Handbook |page=646 |publisher=Footprint Travel Guides |year=1999 |isbn=1-900949-48-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Architectural remains from the Beth Alpha synagogue indicate that the synagogue once stood as two-story basilical building and contained a courtyard, [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], and prayer hall.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Jewish Art and Archaeology in Late-Antiquity'', 232–33&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor of the prayer hall consisted of a central [[nave]] measuring 5.4 meters wide, the apse, which served as the resting place for the Torah Ark, the [[bema#Judaism|bimah]], the raised platform upon which the Torah would have been read, and benches.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah Ark within the [[apse]] was aligned southwest, in the direction of [[Jerusalem]].

==Dedicatory inscriptions==
[[File:Beyt-Alfa-50.jpg|thumb|right|Dedicatory Inscriptions]] The northern entryway features two dedicatory inscriptions in [[Aramaic]] and Greek. Although partially destroyed, the Aramaic inscription indicates that the synagogue was built during the reign of Roman Emperor Justinus, probably [[Justin I]] (518–527 CE), and was funded by communal donations.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 192"&gt;Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek inscription thanks artisans "Marianos and his son Hanina", whom were also listed as the artisans of the nearby Beth Shean synagogue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 192" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions are flanked on either side by a lion and a buffalo, who serve as the synagogue's symbolic guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''The Ancient Synagogue of Beth Alpha'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nave mosaics==

===Northern panel—Binding of Isaac===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|Binding of Isaac]] The northern panel depicts the "[[Binding of Isaac]]" (Genesis 22: 1–18). To the right, [[Abraham]] is depicted dangling Isaac over the fiery altar as he raises his hand to perform the sacrifice. In the center, God, symbolized by the small fire- encircled hand appearing in the upper center, instructs Abraham to sacrifice a nearby ram instead of [[Isaac]]. The [[Hand of God (art)|hand of God]] is aptly labeled with "al tishlah" or "do not raise", taken from God's command to the angel that Abraham not "raise his hand against the boy [Isaac]" (Genesis 22:12).&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel'', 288. Translation taken from the 2003 edition of the Jewish Publication Society Tanakah.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lower center of the composition, immediately below the hand of God, the ram that served as Isaac's substitute is positioned standing sideways, trapped in the nearby thicket.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The odd positioning of the ram may perhaps be a convention the artists used to convey the distance that the [[Bible]] says separated Abraham and Isaac, from the two servant boys (Genesis 22:5), who accompanied Abraham and Isaac on their journey, and are depicted standing to the left. All the figures in the scene, except for the two servants, are identified with Hebrew labels.

The iconographic significance of the "Binding of Isaac" is unclear. There is a wide variety of opinions, with some scholars seeing this narrative as an affirmation of God's mercy, others as symbolic of his continuing covenant with Israel, and others as embodying the rabbinic notion of "zechut avot" or the merit of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of scholarly opinions see Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 287–292; Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco Roman World'', 194–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporaneous Christian church art, where the "Binding of Isaac" was also a popular theme, the narrative was seen as a typological pre-figuration for the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central panel—zodiac wheel===
[[File:Beit Alpha.jpg|thumb|right|Zodiac Wheel with Hebrew Labels]] The central panel features a Jewish adaptation of the Greco-Roman [[zodiac]]. The zodiac consists of two concentric circles, with the twelve zodiac signs appearing in the outer circle, and [[Helios]], the Greco-Roman sun god, appearing in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The outer circle consists of twelve panels, each of which correspond to one of the twelve months of the year and contain the appropriate Greco-Roman zodiac sign. Female busts symbolizing the four seasons appear in the four corners immediately outside the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the center, [[Helios]] appears with his signature Greco-Roman iconographic elements such as the fiery crown of rays adorning his head and the highly stylized [[quadriga]] or four-horse-drawn chariot.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The background is decorated with a crescent shaped moon and stars. As in the "Binding of Isaac" panel, the zodiac symbols and seasonal busts are labeled with their corresponding Hebrew names.

This zodiac wheel, along with other similar examples found in contemporaneous synagogues throughout Israel such as [[Naaran]], [[Susiya]], [[Hamat Tiberias]], Huseifa, and [[Sepphoris]], rest at the center of a scholarly debate regarding the relationship between Judaism and general Greco-Roman culture in late-antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''Art and Judaism'', 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpret the popularity that the zodiac maintains within synagogue floors as evidence for its Judaization and adaptation into the Jewish calendar and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of scholarly views supporting the normative role of the zodiac in Judaism see Fine, ''Art and Judaism'' 184–204 and Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 308–9. Many scholars cite the popularity that the zodiac maintains within late-antique and medieval piyyutim and manuscripts as further support for their views regarding the Judaization of the zodiac.&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as representing the existence of a "non-Rabbinic" or a mystical and Hellenized form of Judaism that embraced the astral religion of Greco-Roman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman World Vol. 8—Astronomical Symbols, 167–195; Magness identifies Helios with the angel, Metatron, see Magness, "Heaven on Earth: Helios and the Zodiac Cycle in Ancient Palestinian Synagogues", 2, 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern panel—synagogue scene===
The southern panel, which was laid before the synagogue's Torah Shrine, is a liturgically oriented scene that emphasizes the centrality of the Torah Shrine. The Torah Shrine stands at the center of the composition and is depicted with a gabled roof. The Torah Shrine is decorated with ornamented panels featuring diamonds and squares.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 34; Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The floating conch shell seen in the center of the roof, is a stylized representation of the Torah Shrine's inset arch.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 284.&lt;/ref&gt; A hanging lamp is suspended from the gable of the roof.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; As a symbolic marker of its importance, the lower register of the Torah Shrine is flanked by two roaring lions and is surrounded by Jewish ritual objects such as the [[lulav]], [[etrog]], [[shofar]], and incense shovel.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; Two birds flank the gabled roof in the upper register of the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 22. Sukenik proposes that the birds are ostriches while Hachlili proposes that the birds are peacocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beyt-Alfa-60.jpg|thumb|Synagogue Scene]]
Two large seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorot]] candelabras stand on either of the Torah shrine. The base and branches of the two Menorot are not identical in form; the right-hand Menorah has an upright base, while the left-hand Menorah has two crescent shaped legs and one upright leg.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the entire scene is framed by the two pulled back curtains, which served to demarcate the sacred space of the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 34; Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the Menorah, which originally stood in the [[Jerusalem Temple]], comes to highlight the continuing importance that the Jerusalem Temple occupied in the development of the synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Menorah also maintained a practical function, as the primary light source for the area around the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''Art and Judaism'', 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Sukenik believed that the two Menorot depicted flanking the Torah Shrine in this scene, likely stood adjacent to the Torah Shrine within the actual Beth Alpha synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 362; Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Birds of a Feather''''' is a 1958 album by [[Carmen McRae]]. The album was arranged by [[Ralph Burns]], and features the saxophonist [[Ben Webster]]. All the songs on the album reference [[bird]]s in some way.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=birds-of-a-feather-mw0000215707|label=Birds of a Feather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Bush reviewed the album for [[Allmusic]] and wrote that "Fortunately, there are plenty of good songs on the subject, and it's not so narrow that all the focus hinges on birds themselves." Bush praised [[Ben Webster]]'s solo on "Bob White (Watcha Gonna Swing Tonight?)".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;
Webster's biographer, Frank Buchmann-Moller, wrote that his performances on the album alternate between "routine and inspired", and likened his work on "Flamingo" to the "beating wings of a landing bird".&lt;ref name="Buchmann-Moller2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Buchmann-Moller|title=Someone to Watch Over Me: The Life and Music of Ben Webster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEQmZPptNy0C&amp;pg=PA174|date=5 February 2010|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-02598-8|pages=174–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buttock cleavage''' is minor exposure of the [[buttocks]] and the [[intergluteal cleft]] between them, often because of [[low-rise pants]].

The crena is another formal term for the cleft between the buttocks, and the medical term is posterior rugae.

==History==
When faced with indecency issues back in the 1930s, W.G. Cassidy explained in an essay titled ''Private Parts: A Judicial View'' that exposure of a buttock cleavage may come under "other private parts" in Australian law, though indecency generally involves exposure of the [[genital area]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, WG. "[http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=972822724348847;res=IELLCC Private parts: A judicial view", ''Southerly''  (Vol. 34, No. 3), pages 315-319, Sep 1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early [[2000s in fashion|2000s]] it became fashionable for young women and men to expose their buttocks this way, often in tandem with [[Low-rise jeans|low rise jeans]].&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;Brown, Janelle. [http://www.salon.com/mwt/style/2002/05/28/booty_call/ "Here come the buns"], ''[[Salon.com]]'', URL accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer D'Angelo, "[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,40105,00.html Cleavage Fashion Flips Upside Down]," FOXNews.com, December 5, 2001, URL accessed 12 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' called it the "new cleavage", and expressed views that "It's virtually impossible to find jeans to cover your hipbone".&lt;ref&gt;Daugherty, Gina. [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/05/29/tem_thurslede29.html "Thong spotting gets easier"],  ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', May 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' celebrated a "bum cleavage week" claiming that "bums are the new tits".&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Anna. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/27/gender.uk "Bum deal: Suddenly, women's bottoms are everywhere. It might seem like jolly, harmless fun, but actually there's nothing innocent about it"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 27, 2001. Accessed February 19, 2008. "Last week was bum cleavage week at the Sun."&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to this trend, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' aired a [[parody advertisement]] in their April 16, 2006 episode for a product called ''Neutrogena Coin Slot Cream'', in which host [[Lindsay Lohan]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCF8ZOYVXF8 |title=Saturday Night Live Skit - Neutrogena Coin Slot Cream |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}{{Verify credibility|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British designer [[Alexander McQueen]] was particularly mentioned as the originator of buttock cleavage-revealing jeans, known as the "bumster", in cultural critique [[Sheila Jeffreys]]' ''Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Jeffreys, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UAi55tsTffgC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=buttock+cleavage&amp;lr=&amp;ei=mF-7R5DyJobosQPYluChBQ&amp;sig=-fHUmClfc1tQCQz_bUe0Sk6jwfI Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West], page 98, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-35183-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States Patent 6473908 from 2002 registers a design for trousers with a removable buttock cleavage-revealing portion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6473908-description.html Garment having a buttocks cleavage revealing feature], Patent Storm&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-2000s, ''[[Good Morning America]]'' reported on a rise of popularity of the buttock cleavage among celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125903&amp;page=1 "Celebrities Are Showing Off Butt Cleavage"], ''[[Good Morning America]]'', July 25. Accessed February 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luna Star at Exxxotica NJ 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|A model in very short [[shorts]] with exposed underbuns]]

In 2010s, media reported rise in popularity among females of ultra-short [[miniskirts]] and [[shorts]], which publicly exposed [[underbuns]] (i.e. lower part of [[buttocks]] - also referred as [[wikt:underbutt|underbutt]]s or "reverse buttock cleavage"), due to endorsement by such celebrities as [[Lady Gaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/799234/underbun-pictures-reddit|title=WHAT is the underbun?

==Lexicon==
[[File:Belt Failure (234582464).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|"Plumber's crack"]]

The terms ''plumber butt'' or ''plumber's crack'' (Canadian, Australian and American English) and ''builder's bum'' (British English) refer to the exposure of male buttock cleavage, especially on occasions of careless bending over. The expression "builder's bum" was first recorded in 1988. The terms are based on the popular impression that work in these professions frequently involves bending over in locations where bystanders are observing from the rear.&lt;ref&gt;"Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase &amp; Fable", by John Ayto, Ian Crofton (2006) {{ISBN|0-304-36809-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3DiHy31K30oC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22plumber%27s+butt%22+-wikipedia&amp;ei=wS_ASITTD4PSswOtiKHXDA&amp;sig=ACfU3U3-edJh9qb_z6Z7sVelCB-SpsIMsA p.121]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands the term {{lang|nl|bouwvakkersdecolleté}} and in Germany {{lang|de|maurerdekolleté}} and in Poland {{lang|pl|dekolt hydraulika}} is used, which can be translated as "builder's/mason's/plumber's [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]". In France, it is usually referred to as {{lang|fr|le sourire du plombier}}, which translates to "the plumber's smile".

'''''Dark Souls'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|ダークソウル|Dāku Sōru|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Namco Bandai Games]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan by FromSoftware in September 2011 and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games in the following month. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind.

''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered to be one of the [[best video games ever released]], with critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and world lore. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews. While some praised the challenge it provides, others criticized it for being unnecessarily unforgiving. The Windows version of the game was less well received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues.

In August 2012, a version of ''Dark Souls'' for [[Microsoft Windows]], ''[[#PC version|Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition]]'', was released. It featured additional content not seen in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. In October 2012, the additional content was released as [[downloadable content]] for consoles under the subtitle ''[[Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss|Artorias of the Abyss]]''. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide.  A sequel to the game, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', was released in 2014. A remastered version of the game, ''[[#Dark Souls: Remastered|Dark Souls: Remastered]]'', was released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], Windows, and [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[player character]] (right) battling Knight Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through [[downloadable content]]]]
''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central element to ''Dark Souls'' are [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level.  When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.

Another aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the "humanity" system. There are two "forms" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form.  Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a "humanity").  In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form.  While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their "bloodstain", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.

Communication between players is deliberately restricted. Outside of character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. In addition, players can enter [[co-cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not mandatory to engage with. If the player does choose to engage with them, the characters are able to assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights.

== Plot ==
Dark Souls has a minimalist plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design. The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. The world was once ruled by dragons. In this time period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the "First Flame" and finds the "Lord Souls". He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death.

The game's protagonist is known as the chosen undead. After going through Sens Fortress, the chosen undead defeats the Iron Golem, and soon enters taken into Anor Londo. The Chosen Undead defeats Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough and then enters a throne room of Gwynevere, who gives the chosen undead an object known as the "Lordvessel". Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player is given the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.

=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===
{{Main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}
At some point in the past, a being known as Manus awoke and began to spread the Abyss. Knight Artorias was sent to stop the spread of the Abyss, but he failed and became corrupted. Meanwhile, Manus searches desperately for his long-lost pendant across space and time. Once the player obtains the pendant, Manus pulls them into the past. There, the player destroys the corrupted Artorias and defeats Manus, halting the spread of the Abyss.

''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. Following the game's release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, many gamers expressed their hope for a PC version. International publisher [[Namco Bandai Games]] administrator Tony Shoupinou responded on their page that a PC version was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/01/08/dark-souls-admin-suggests-pc-could-happen-with-a-petition/ |title=Dark Souls admin suggests PC could happen with a petition |publisher=Joystiq |date=January 8, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012, fans started a petition to bring ''Dark Souls'' to PC, with over 93,000 people signing it.&lt;ref name="pc_petition"&gt;{{cite web |title=Petition: Dark Souls for PC |url=http://petitionbureau.org/DarkSoulsForPC/ |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PC version of the game was confirmed in April 2012 via German magazine ''PC Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Donaldson |first=Alex |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/news/1512-dark-souls-pc-confirmed-in-pc-action-magazine |title=Dark Souls PC confirmed in PC Action magazine |website=rpgsite.net |date=April 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026202607/http://www.rpgsite.net/news/1512-dark-souls-pc-confirmed-in-pc-action-magazine |archive-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been reported during the development process that FromSoftware had been having difficulty with the port due to inexperience with PC as a platform and were focusing on new content rather than optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-06-07-from-software-having-a-tough-time-porting-dark-souls-to-pc-frame-rate-issues-remain |title=From Software "having a tough time" porting Dark Souls to PC, frame rate issues remain |first=Fred |last=Dutton |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-branded as the ''Prepare To Die Edition'', it came out in August 2012 and featured new content, including bosses, enemies, equipment, and NPCs.&lt;ref name="gamingbolt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamingbolt.com/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition-coming-to-pc-in-august |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition coming to PC in August « GamingBolt.com: Video Game News, Reviews, Previews and Blog |publisher=Gamingbolt.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new content, titled "''Artorias of the Abyss''", was released for consoles in October 2012 in the form of DLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/05/31/dark-souls-pc-coming-to-steam-consoles-to-get-pc-content/ |title=Dark Souls PC coming to Steam, consoles to get PC content |last=Cullen |first=Johnny |date=May 31, 2012 |publisher=VG247 |accessdate=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, it was announced that ''Dark Souls'' for PC would use [[Games for Windows – Live]] for online play and DRM, spurring fan backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |title=Gamers rallying against Dark Souls PC using Games for Windows Live |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/gamers-rallying-against-dark-souls-pc-using-games-for-windows-live-6371507 |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420174732/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/gamers-rallying-against-dark-souls-pc-using-games-for-windows-live-6371507 |archivedate=April 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls'' received positive reviews from critics upon its release. One of the reviewers for ''Dark Souls'' described it as "a very hardcore dark-fantasy [role-playing game]" that is "role-playing right down to the roots", and stated that the "massive field map and powerful enemies serve to rev up both your sense of adventure and your sense of dread". Another reviewer stated that "the sheer happiness you get after the trial-and-error pays off and you overcome the challenge is absolutely impossible to replicate."&lt;ref name="1up_gifford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gifford |first=Kevin |title=Japan Review Check: Dark Souls |url=http://www.1up.com/news/japan-review-check-dark-souls |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpot]] scored ''Dark Souls'' a 9.5/10. Much praise was given to the online system, as well as the sense of jubilation felt when conquering boss fights after numerous failed attempts. They also suggested that casual gamers may struggle to progress, whereas role-playing game enthusiasts will thrive on the difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-review/1900-6337621/ |title=Dark Souls Review |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=October 3, 2011 |website=|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] gave ''Dark Souls'' a 9.0/10, praising the well-thought-out level design, variety, strong emphasis on online features, excessively dark tone and atmosphere, and deep gameplay. While praising the extremely high difficulty, they stated that "there's a difference between punishing, and downright unfair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keza MacDonald |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review?page=1 |title=Dark Souls Review |publisher=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] gave ''Dark Souls'' 9/10, praising the level design and atmosphere while noting that the game's difficulty might not appeal to casual gamers.&lt;ref name="eurog_dark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=Oli |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-03-dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review • Page 1 • Reviews • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese publication Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40 score.&lt;ref name="famitsu1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=16392|title=ダークソウル [PS3] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Michael Thomsen asked if a 100-hour video game was ever worthwhile, stating:

{{Quote|There is real beauty in ''Dark Souls''. It reveals that life is more suffering than pleasure, more failure than success, and that even the momentary relief of achievement is wiped away by new levels of difficulty. It is also a testament to our persistence in the face of that suffering, and it offers the comfort of a community of other players all stuck in the same hellish quagmire. Those are good qualities. That is art. And you can get all of that from the first five hours of Dark Souls. The remaining 90 or so offer nothing but an increasingly nonsensical variation on that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomsen |first=Michael |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gaming/2012/02/dark_souls_review_is_a_100_hour_video_game_ever_worthwhile_.html |title=Dark Souls review: Is a 100-hour video game ever worthwhile? – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jason Killingsworth wrote a response to Thomsen's review for ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', arguing that the game's "vertigo-inducing breadth makes it the gaming equivalent of a marathon".&lt;ref name="Killingsworth, Jason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/opinion/opinion-long-live-long-rpg |title=Opinion: Long live the long RPG |author=Killingsworth, Jason |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killingsworth praised the game's length and addictive nature.&lt;ref name="Killingsworth, Jason"/&gt;

''Edge'' later retroactively awarded the game 10 out of 10 in their October 2013 20th anniversary issue, stating that over time the breadth and quality of the game's design had overruled complaints about its difficulty.&lt;ref name="edgeten"&gt;{{cite web |title=The ten amendments: we crown seven games from the last 20 years of Edge with a retrospective 10 |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-ten-amendments-we-crown-seven-games-from-the-last-20-years-of-edge-with-a-retrospective-10/ |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the game, [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] praised ''Dark Souls'' in his [[Zero Punctuation]] video for its deep gameplay and immersive atmosphere, but was "disappointed" with the late-game bosses and criticized the difficulty of getting into the game, stating that the difficulty would be a key factor in turning less new players off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8802-Dark-Souls |title=Dark Souls - Zero Punctuation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-release, the game's director, [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], contemplated adding an easier [[difficulty level]], stating that he was saddened by the fact that the difficulty deterred new players from playing the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-04-dark-souls-director-considering-adding-optional-easy-mode |title=Dark Souls director considering adding optional easy mode • News • PlayStation 3 • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Namco Bandai]] claimed Miyazaki's statement was mistranslated and should have read "This fact is really sad to me and I am thinking about how to make everyone complete the game while maintaining the current difficulty and carefully send all gamers the messages behind it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-07-dark-souls-easy-mode-quote-a-mistranslation-apparently |title=Dark Souls Easy Mode quote a mistranslation, apparently • News • PlayStation 3 • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PC version ===
In [[GameSpy]]'s review, the port was referred to as "shabby", citing the game's limit of 30 frames per second, poor mouse and keyboard controls, and nonadjustable resolution, but the expanded content was praised, giving the game an overall favorable review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Janicki |first=Stefan |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition Review |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dark-souls/1225854p1.html |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]] also commented on the quality of the port, stating: "''Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition'' does not come with the technical options you would expect from a well-engineered PC game, because it's a port of a console game, and that's all FromSoftware ever promised to deliver. Anyone who passes up Dark Souls for this reason is cutting off their nose to spite their [[neckbeard (slang)|neckbeard]] of a face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stanton |first=Rich |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-28-dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition-review |title=Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition Review • Reviews • PC • |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the producers of ''Dark Souls II'', Takeshi Miyazoe, responded to the criticism of the PC version by saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected/ |title=Dark Souls’ producer says PC version was rushed, problems "were expected" |date=December 19, 2013 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is going to sound bad but our main priority was to get the game onto the PC as fast as possible, because people wanted it on the PC. The PC market in Japan is so minimal that originally there were no plans to make it on the PC, but with the strong petition from the North American and European fans, even with the lack of experience of working on a PC platform we still did our best to try to get it out as fast as possible. [The problems] were expected to a certain extent.

We did know there were PC-specific features like key-mapping and use of the mouse and keyboard, high resolution and higher frame rate, stuff like that, but... It's not that we ignored it, but it would have taken too much time for us to implement it, test it and get it up to the level people expected. It was more of a publisher (Namco Bandai) decision to say, ‘Guys, don’t worry about this – let’s just get it out and see how this works on PC.'

'''''Everybody's Magazine''''' was an American magazine published from 1899 to 1929.&lt;ref name="spar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everybody's Magazine|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/USAeverybodys.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=William Hard|title=Unemployment as a Coming Issue|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/alablegr2&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|work=Hein Online|accessdate=19 February 2016|date=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded by [[Philadelphia]] merchant [[John Wanamaker]] in 1899, though he had little role in its actual operations.&lt;ref name="mott1"&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott|Mott, Frank Luther]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ERGJfgsppfgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sketches of 21 Magazines: 1905-1930], p. 72-87 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Initially, the magazine published a combination of non-fiction articles and new fiction stories.  By 1926, the magazine had become a [[pulp fiction magazine]] and in 1929 it merged with ''[[Romance (magazine)|Romance magazine]].

In 1903, it had a circulation of 150,000, and Wanamaker sold the magazine for $75,000 to a group headed by [[Erman Jesse Ridgway]].  A series of muckraking articles called "Frenzied Finance" in 1904 boosted circulation to well over 500,000, and it stayed above the half million mark for many years.  During America's involvement in World War I, circulation declined below 300,000.  By the late 1920s, it had declined to about 50,000.&lt;ref name="mott1"/&gt;

Beginning in 1915, the magazine began referring to itself simply as ''Everybody's''.

Writers who appeared in ''Everybody's Magazine'' included [[Jack London]], [[Talbot Mundy]], [[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Victor Rousseau]], [[O. Henry]], [[A. A. Milne]] (Milne's novel ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' was serialised in the magazine from August to December 1921 as ''The Red House Murder'')&lt;ref&gt;Ed Hulse, ''The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Collecting Pulps''. Murania Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-9795955-0-9}}  (pp. 168-169)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Pendexter]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Raoul Whitfield]] and [[Dornford Yates]].

The last issue of ''Everybody's Magazine'' was published in March 1929.&lt;ref name="spar"/&gt;

'''Factotum''' is both an arts organisation and artists' project that was formed in 2001 by Stephen Hackett and Richard West. They publish [[The Vacuum]] newspaper, put on exhibitions, publish books and make films. In the past they have also run a choir, staged contemporary dance events and organised talks. In 2005 Factotum won a Paul Hamlyn Award for the Visual Arts and participated in Northern Ireland's first showing in the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Factotum's work often involves collaborating with a wide range of other arts organisations, artists and writers.

== Cultural history ==

Factotum are based in [[Belfast]] and their work is often about the city and its history. In 2003 they produced a book and CD called 'Belfast Songs' in which a number of writers, including [[Glenn Patterson]], [[Paul Muldoon]] and [[Leontia Flynn]], each wrote about famous songs representing the city. Factotum's work is sometimes documentary or archival in nature, as in their 2005 photographic exhibition 'The English', which was largely made up of previously unseen photographs from the Imperial War Museum's archive of the British army in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 80s. Their treatment of this historical material can involve an implied cultural criticism in the way it is recontextualised. The Factotum Choir, for example, sang a repertoire made up of songs in praise of Stalin (such as [[Ewan MacColl|Ewan MacColl's]] 'Ballad of Stalin'), corporate songs ('Fokker on the Wing') and national anthems for countries that no longer exist (such as [[Rhodesia]]). Factotum's exhibitions and publications can also be explicit in criticising attempts to rebrand and redevelop Belfast and the role of marketing and Public Relations in general, as in their 2008 show 'A Century of Spin' about PR photography.

== Parody and satire ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cannibal Begorrah.jpg|thumb|Poster for film Cannibal Begorrah included in Factotum's 'Unseen Offscreen' exhibition.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 10 July 2009}}]]  --&gt;
As well as presenting historical material, Factotum's work also frequently involves elements of satire and parody. A special 'Cobbled Quarter' supplement to The Vacuum closely resembled the corporate freesheet 'Laganlines' published by the [[Laganside Corporation|Laganside]] quango to promote their newly branded [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|'Cathedral Quarter']]. It included such events as 'Hermitfest' and the 'Festival of Pathetic Maritime Disasters' much like the facepainting and [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] themed events in the quango's publicity material. Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between documentary and spoof elements of Factotum projects. In 2006 they put on an exhibition about the Factotum Choir in the [[Project Arts Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectartscentre.ie/index.php/archive/archive-va-detail/305-the-choir Information about the Factotum Choir exhibition at the Project Arts Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt; in Dublin (subsequently toured to other venues). This exhibition contained film clips, artefacts (like record covers and a desiccated cat) and an extensive history of the Choir from the 1950s to 2000. Reviewers of the exhibition have been divided as to whether the material in the exhibition is genuine or fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2910481.html Article in Hot Press magazine about the Factotum Choir Exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Factotum organised an exhibition called 'Northern Ireland Unseen Offscreen' as part of the [[Belfast Film Festival]]. The exhibition was of posters for films made in Northern Ireland that were never completed or have subsequently been forgotten and included such titles as 'Cannibal Begorrah' (a horror film set in Fermanagh), 'An Ulster American Folk Park in London' (An 80s small town/ big city corporate drama), 'Dafty Wains Go Buck Mental' (An Ulster Scots gross-out comedy) and 'King Billy's Pink Adventure' (a 70s art house film). Reviewers of this exhibition have expressed scepticism as to how much, if any, of this material is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=2592 News story by Culture Northern Ireland questioning whether the Northern Ireland Unseen Offscreen exhibition is factual or parodic.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building once used had the "headless dog" image on the brickwork outside. The scions of Hilden Brewery family set up College Green Brewery (though, in fact, a restaurant and not a brewery - ales are supplied by Hilden Brewery) and used the image as the logo for their "Headless Dog" ale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hildenbrewery.co.uk/beer_bottle_collegegreen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://marksalehouse.com/hildenbrewery.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factotum film ==
In 2009 Factotum finished a film called 'Ditching' a feature length story about two people going on a journey across Northern Ireland in a desolate post-apocalyptic future.

The '''Flintshire flag''' ({{lang-cy|Baner Sir y Fflint}}) is the flag of the [[Flintshire (historic)|county of Flint]]. A campaign was launched in September 2012 to have the flag recognised by the [[Flag Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flintshirechronicle.co.uk/flintshire-news/local-flintshire-news/2012/09/06/calls-for-flintshire-county-flag-to-be-established-51352-31774644/ |title=Calls for Flintshire county flag to be established |publisher=Flintshire Chronicle |accessdate=11 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225011418/http://www.flintshirechronicle.co.uk/flintshire-news/local-flintshire-news/2012/09/06/calls-for-flintshire-county-flag-to-be-established-51352-31774644/ |archivedate=December 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcounties.co.uk/counties/county-flags/county-flag-proposals?showall=1|author=Association of British Counties|title=County flag proposals|accessdate=11 September 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was formally adopted on 24 February 2015.

__TOC__

==Design==
[[File:Flintshire Shield.svg|thumb|right|140px|Arms of the former Flintshire County Council]]
The flag is the banner of the [[Coat of arms|arms]] anachronistically attributed to [[Edwin of Tegeingl|Edwin]], ruler of the former kingdom of [[Tegeingl]] that covered much of the territory of Flintshire.

Those arms bore a black [[Line (heraldry)#Engrailed and invected|engrail]]ed fleury cross (i.e. a cross capped with [[fleur-de-lis]] ends and ''scalloped'' edges) on a white field between four [[red-billed chough|chough]]s, a bird once likely to have been widespread in the area, in black and red. These arms, in a slightly amended form, had been used by the former Flintshire County Council.

The council arms are differenced by the addition of discs on the arms of the cross and a voided diamond (mascle) at the centre. The flag simplifies the design but retains much of the basic symbolism and essential [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s of the original arms in a way more suitable for use as a flag.

'''''Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India''''' (2002, {{ISBN|0-670-04928-X}}) is a book written by scientist-patriot Dr. [[A P J Abdul Kalam]], who was the [[President of India]] from 2002 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nuclear Scientist, 70, a Folk Hero, Is Elected India's President |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B10FC3A5D0C7A8DDDAE0894DA404482 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 July 2002 |accessdate=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kalam, the finest President in India: Lord Paul |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/401698.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=3 January 2004 |accessdate=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ignited Minds'' is a logical step forward from Dr. Kalam's earlier book, ''[[India 2020|India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium]]'' (1998, {{ISBN|0-670-88271-2}}). This book consists of many inspirational messages by A P J Abdul Kalam.

Dr. Kalam has dedicated ''Ignited Minds'' to an [[intermediate school]] child, named Snehal Thakkar, whom he met at a school   ( named Anandalaya in Anand, Gujarat, [[Anandalaya Education Society]] ) and while talking to her [[student]]s, a question had come up: "Who is our enemy?". Kalam recalled that many answers came up, but the answer on which all agreed came from his (Snehal Thakkar): "Our enemy is poverty". The small book of 205 pages contains dynamic and original ideas, examines attitudes afflicting the Indians, and present prescriptions for rapid growth of India to enable the country to emerge as a [[developed country]]. The scientist and the seer inside Kalam has addressed the book to young citizen(s) of India. This book has been the most wanted and demanded all over the world after the death of Abdul Kalam.

== Chapters ==

The book is organised into eleven [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s, dealing with various issues. These chapters are:

#The Dreams and the Message
#Give Us a Role Model
#Visionary Teachers and Scientists
#Learning from Saints and Seers
#Patriotism beyond Politics and Religion
#The Knowledge Society
#Getting the Forces Together
#Building a New State
#To my Countrymen
#Conclusion
#Bibliography

== Synopsis ==

*The book begins with a sad note. On 30 September 2001, Kalam’s [[helicopter]], while on its way from [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] state, India to [[Bokaro Steel City|Bokaro
]] crashed, but all aboard miraculously survived. He was administered that night a [[tranquilizer]], and he recalls having seen a very vivid dream. He writes in the book that he saw himself in a [[desert]] “with miles of sand all around," and there stood five men, namely, [[Emperor Ashoka]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Caliph Omar]]. Kalam felt dwarfed by their presence, and recounts the words of these great personalities.&lt;br&gt;In this chapter Kalam has written "Dream, dream, dream, dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action"
*The next chapter emphasises the importance of mother, father and elementary school teachers as [[role model]]s.
*The third chapter tells that "Vision ignites the minds", and talks about the modern Indian visionaries like [[J. R. D. Tata]], [[Vikram Sarabhai]], [[Satish Dhawan]] and Dr. [[Verghese Kurien]].
*The next section of the book deals with the [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] of the Indian nation and talks about developing a model of development based on India's inherent strengths.
*The fifth chapter of the book exhorts the Indians, constituting a nation of one billion people "with multitude [[faith]]s and [[ideologies]]" to develop a "national vision" and amalgamate into one "national forum."
*The next chapter begins with a [[Thirukkural]], which states: &lt;br&gt;"Wisdom is a weapon to ward off destruction;&lt;br&gt;It is an inner fortress which enemies cannot destroy".&lt;br&gt; This chapter reminds the readers that [[History of India|Ancient India]] was a "knowledge society that contributed a great deal to civilization."
*The caption line of the seventh chapter is followed by the following inspiring words of [[Abraham Lincoln]]: &lt;br&gt; "Determine that things can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way."
*The eighth chapter exhorts for a change in the mindset and to take pragmatic risks, which shall result in success.
*The ninth and the last chapter, with the caption line of "To My Countrymen" begins with few words of the [[Nobel laureate]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]] - "let my country awake."
*The book ends with a "Song of Youth", with these opening words: &lt;br&gt;"As a young citizen of India,&lt;br&gt;armed with technology and love for my nation,&lt;br&gt;I realize, a small aim is a crime."

The '''International Sculpture Symposium''' movement was spearheaded by [[Karl Prantl (sculptor)|Karl Prantl]] in [[Austria]] in 1959.
This initiative grew from the need to facilitate communication and exchange between members of the international sculpture community. It was also rooted in [[Cold War]] tensions, which lent a particular urgency to the need for cross-cultural dialogue on a person-to-person basis.
The first international sculpture symposium took place in an abandoned stone quarry in [[Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland]]. 

Sculptors from around the world joined together to produce a permanent public artwork from local stone, a dynamic which would provide the model for many symposia to follow. 

Since then international sculpture symposia have been held in numerous towns and cities around the world, including [[Lindabrunn, Austria]] and [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], [[Japan]] (a town known for its [[Japanese pottery|pottery]]). The first international sculpture symposia in the United States (and the first on a college campus) was in 1965 on the [[California State University, Long Beach]] campus in [[Long Beach, California]].

The first International Sculpture Symposium ([[Vermont International Sculpture Symposium]]) in the United States was held in [[Proctor]], [[Vermont]] in 1986 under the joint sponsorship of Vermont Marble Company, [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and Vermont Council on the Arts. Participating sculptors were from the United States, Austria, Japan, Germany, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Vermont symposium-NCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Sculptors Symposium|url=http://www.ncmodernist.org/NCARCHITECT/1968-10.pdf|website=North Carolina Architect|publisher=The North Carolina chapter of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=5 August 2018|pages=17–18|date=October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Sculpture Symposium in Australia was held at Wondabyne near Gosford in New South Wales in 1986. 
It was followed by the Barossa International Sculpture Symposium in Mengler Hill near Tanunda in the Barossa in South Australia in 1988. Nine sculptures in Marble and Granite were carved by sculptors from France, the United States, Japan and Australia. The site is now the Barossa Sculpture Park.

As part of the program in 2001, the [[Republic of South Africa]] War Memorial ''Reconciliation'' by sculptor [[Strijdom van der Merwe]] was created for the sculpture park at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref name="southafrica-embassy"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Sculpture Park|url=http://southafrica-embassy.or.kr/eng/sankorea/korean_war(UNMCK).php|work=UNMCK|publisher=Republic of South Africa Embassy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the memorial began in March 2001, and despite the [[September 11 attacks]] on the nearby [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], which also affected surrounding areas, the memorial was completed and dedicated on July 16, 2002.&lt;ref name="nyt-2002-07-16"/&gt;

The memorial, designed collaboratively by artist Brian Tolle, [[landscape architect]] Gail Wittwer-Laird, and architecture firm [[1100 Architect]], is landscaped with stones, soil, and native vegetation transported from the western coast of [[Ireland]] &amp;mdash; with stones from all counties of [[Ireland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17029">'''Literary criticism''' ({{lang-fa|نقد ادبی}}) is a relatively young discipline in [[Iran]] since there had been no comparable tradition of [[literary criticism]] before the nineteenth century, when European influence first began to penetrate the country.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_13"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical tradition ==

[[Literary criticism]] in the [[Europe]]an sense never existed 

=== Pre-Islamic period ===

No text devoted to literary criticism has survived from the period before Islam. However, there is tantalizing mention of the titles of such works, such as ''Karvand''.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_13"/&gt; There is the possibility that Iranian elites were familiar with [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. Greek culture was cultivated during the [[philhellenism|philhellenic]] [[Parthia|Arsacid dynasty]], so much so that "in the courts of Arsacid kings Greek plays were performed in the original language".&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_13"/&gt; Even as late as the [[Sassanid Empire]], Greek philosophers took refuge in Iran in the academy at [[Gundeshapur]]. However, it remains a matter for speculation how much influence Greek ideas had on the literature of the period before [[Islam]].

=== Samanid period ===

The oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism is the ''Muqaddamah-i Shāhnāmah-i Abū Manṣūrī'' (Introduction to Abū Manṣūr's ''Shāhnāmah''). "This work deals with the myths and legends of the ''Shāhnāmah'' and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During much of this period, commentary on poetry would take the form of either slander or excessive praise, that is "sophistry or exaggeration of trivial errors in the poetry of rivals."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sarcastic remarks occasionally encountered in the poetry books... relating to rival poets are slanderous in nature and not genuinely critical. Conversely, when poets wrote favorably about each other, they merely exchanged flattery. Shahīd and [[Rudaki|Rūdakī]] admired one another and Rūdakī was praised by Kasā'ī, [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi|Daqīqī]], Farrukhī, and ʿUnsurī; ʿUnsurī and Ghazā'irī, however, belittled each other's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Seljuq period ===

During the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq period]], with the growing influence of [[Arabic literature]] a more technical style of literary criticism (''naqd-i fannī'') became predominant.

''Tarjumān al-Balāghah'' by Muḥammad b. ʿUmar Rādūyānī "illustrates seventy-three types of rhetorical figures with Persian poems cited as examples in each case."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_16"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashīd al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Muḥammad Vaṭvāṭ in his ''Ḥadā'iq al-Siḥr'' gives "different definitions of rhetorical figures."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_16"/&gt; Kaykāvūs b. Iskandar in his ''Qābūs'nāmah'' says this of prose style: "In [[Arabic]] letters rhymed prose is a sign of distinction, whereas it is disapproved in letters written in Persian, and much better omitted. Let all the language you use be elevated, metaphorical, mellifluous and terse."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|pp=16–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known classical works on literary criticism is ''Chahār Maqālah'' ("Four Essays") by [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizāmī ʿArūzī Samarqandī]], in which the author treats the "definition, essence, and purpose" of poetry.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_17"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongol period ===

During [[Ilkhanate|this period]], the compilation of ''tazkirāt'' (anthologies sg. ''tazkirah'') produced "criticism of taste (''naqd-i zawqī'')"&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_17"/&gt; which really represented a return to the ''ad hominem'' attacks and rival name-calling which characterize much of what passes for literary criticism during most of Iranian history. "As with earlier periods, the practitioners of the criticism of taste belittled their predecessors in order to aggrandize themselves."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_17"/&gt; Muḥammad ʿAwfī wrote two of the most notable: ''Jawāmiʿ al-hikāyat'' and ''Lubāb al-albāb''.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_18"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawlatshāh Samarqandī's ''Tazkirāt al-shuʿarā'' "can be called the first true anthology of Persian poetry."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_19"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other ''tazkirāt'' of this period:

* ''Miʿyār al-ashʿār'', Khwājih Nāṣir al-Din Ṭūsī
* ''Ḥadā'iq al-ḥaqā'iq'' and ''Anīs al-ʿushshāq'', Sharaf al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Ḥasan Rāmī
* Essays by ʿAbd al-Rahmān Jāmī "noteworthy only for their vulgarity"&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_19"/&gt;

Some critics went against this trend. Shams-i Qays Rāzī wrote ''al-Muʿjam fī maʿāyir ashʿār al-ʿajam'' which is "the most comprehensive text of its kind to that date" and treats [[Prosody (poetry)|prosodic]] technique and terminology and poetic feet, rhyme, and criticism in two volumes.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_18"/&gt; 

=== Safavid period ===

The poetry of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid period]] is characteristic of what has since come to be known as ''[[sabk-i hindī]]'' ("Indian style,"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Amir Khusro|Amīr Khusraw Dihlavī]]&lt;/ref&gt; also called ''Ṣafavī'' or ''Iṣfahānī'' after the dynasty which nurtured it and its capital, respectively), marked by innovative and complex metaphor (as opposed to the simpler ''ʿIrāqī'' or ''[[Khorasani style (poetry)|Khurāsānī]]'' style of the earliest Persian poetry). Then, too, the primary literary critical works were ''tazkirāt'', most prominently ''Tuḥfah-i Sāmī'' by Sām Mīrzā.

A sharp rebuke to the ''sabk-i hindī'' occurred in the eighteenth century when some poets urged a return to the "purer, simpler, and more lucid diction" of earlier poets.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_21"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent members of this group was Luṭf ʿAlī b. Āqā Khān Āzar Baygdilī, who compiled ''Ātashkadah''.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_21"/&gt; This reaction against Indian-style Persian poetry has continued to the present century, when even Western scholars such as [[Edward Granville Browne|E.G. Browne]] have dismissed this tradition. Riza Qulī Khān Hidāyat (born 1800) in the introduction to his ''Majmaʿ al-Fuṣaḥā'', writes the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Under the Turkomans and the Safavids, reprehensible styles appeared ... and since there were not binding rules for lyrics, the poets, following their sick natures and distorted tastes, began to write confused, vain, and nonsensical poems. They placed in their poetry insipid meanings instead of inspired truths, ugly contents ... instead of fine rhetorical devices and attractive innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan. "Safavid Literature: Progress or Decline," ''Iranian Studies'', vol. 7, 1974, pp. 240-242. Citing Hedayat, ''Majmaʿ al-Fusahā''. ed. Mazaher Mossafa, Tehran, 1336 Sh./1957, vol. 1, pp. 9-10, qtd. in {{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Qajar period ===

The [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]] is not known for any contributions to the ''classical'' tradition of literary criticism in Iran, but rather for the appearance of liberal social critics who are better treated in the context of the Iranian reform movement.

== Modern literary criticism ==

Starting in the nineteenth century, criticism of literature became bound up with criticism of all the "entrenched political and economic institutions".&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_23"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due largely to the encroachment of European political and cultural influence which undermined the traditional society of Iran.&lt;reference needed&gt;

=== Historical background ===

During the nineteenth century, Iranians for the first time felt the impact of the [[Industrialization|industrializing]] European powers. [[Russia]] incurred the first serious defeat against Iran by a European power during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War]]. The [[Treaty of Gulistan]] ceded large parts of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the [[Russian Empire]]. In [[Central Asia]], Russia and [[Great Britain]] were waging a [[Great Game|contest]] for influence and concessions. British interests in [[India]] compelled them to create the buffer state of [[Afghanistan]]. Iranian ambitions to recapture [[Herat]], were constantly frustrated during the [[Anglo-Persian War]] and the city has remained a part of Afghanistan ever since. At the same time, European sea-traffic had bypassed the ancient [[Silk Road]], which had been the backbone of Iran's economy since time immemorial. Traditional craftsmen could no longer compete with a flood of cheap, industrially produced goods from Europe. The nineteenth century was a traumatic period for much of the world as European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers stretched their possessions over the globe, and Iran was no exception.

In the midst of all these setbacks, many Iranians awoke to an urgent sense of the need for reform. More and more Iranians left Iran to study in Europe. Translations into Persian of Western works began to appear with greater frequency. Even the Qajar princes themselves, who were most threatened by these changes, attempted stillborn reforms of their own (usually military or industrial) in an attempt to "catch up" with the West. It is therefore no surprise that the criticism of literature at this time assumed a strongly social-reformist dimension.

=== Rationalism ===

The intellectual underpinning of the new criticism was possible because of the rise of rational, critical thought. The European thinkers most popular to the growing class of reformist intellectuals were those of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton]]&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_23"/&gt; 

The [[Iranian reform movement]] can be seen in the context of the earlier movements in Europe and North America whereby "philosophers and thinkers arose ... who, through their criticism, challenged deeply seated superstition, ignorance and injustice."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_24"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An element common to these is the imagery of light (cf. [[Persian language|Persian]]: ''rawshan'fikr'' "enlightened") and dark:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The movement these thinkers set in motion stood as a bulwark in defense of knowledge, learning, and reform, and, through the promotion of understanding and wisdom, sought to dispel the ''darkness'' of superstition and ignorance.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_24"/&gt;[emphasis added]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Literary Critics ===

In the late Qajar period, from the late 19th century until the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], several themes are common among the new literary critics.

# ''[[Realism (arts)|Realism]]'', or "social critical realism";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics discouraged imaginative or fanciful works and urged the production of literature which reflected real life.
# ''Patriotism''; critics appealed for the establishment of a strong national literature which would inspire patriotism in Iranians. Patriotism was considered a moral virtue and critics saw Iran's troubles grandly as the result of the decline in moral values.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_33"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''"Protest"'';&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_33"/&gt; by this term what is meant is the graphic, vitriolic language used by these critics in their attacks. In this sense the modern critics really continue the classical critical tradition, if it could be so called, based on slandering rivals.
# ''Simplicity'', that is, "rejection of affectation and abstruseness [of] language";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics encouraged simple, clear prose and verse styles. 

For this generation of thinkers, Iranian backwardness was the result of its culture's decay. They sought to place attention on the shortcomings of Iran's literature, because they thought that by revitalizing it they could lay the ground for the revitalization of their society. "Such an approach, of course, ignores the fact that illiteracy and ignorance are the outward manifestations of a poor, backward, medieval economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mīrzā Fatḥ ʿAlī Ākhūnd'zādah ====

{{See also|Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzadeh}}

Considered  the "founder of modern literary criticism in Iran,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mīrzā Fatḥ ʿAlī Ākhūnd'zādah used literary criticism as "the vehicle for his reformist impulse."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_56"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ākhund'zādah, because of his unfamiliarity with the Persian language and its prosody, made technical errors in some of his criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was just as verbose and incoherent as those he attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was the first critic in the modern tradition. He emphasized "realistic content in prose and poetry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked the "decadence of Persian literature — a literature that failed to address the social needs of its time."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_56"/&gt; 

He published many works on literary criticism:
* ''Qirītīkah'' ("Criticism")
* ''Risālah-i īrād'' ("Fault-finding treatise")
* ''Fann-i kirītīkah'' ("Art of criticism")
* ''Darbārah-i Mullā-yi Rūmī va tasnīf-i ū'' ("On Rumi and his work")
* ''Darbārah-i nazm va nasr'' ("On verse and prose")
* ''Fihrist-i kitāb'' ("Preface to the book")
* ''Maktūb bih Mīrzā Āqā Tabrīzī'' ("Letter to Mīrzā Āqā Tabrīzī")
* ''Uṣūl-i nigārish'' ("Principles of writing")

==== Mīrzā Āqā Khān Kirmānī ====

{{See also|Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani}}

Kirmānī emphasized "that it is meaning, not the mode of expression, that exerts the real influence on the reader,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus discouraged the "destruction of the natural clarity of language ... by means of complicated metaphors, difficult words, long sentences, and complex expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* ''Fann-i guftan va nivishtan'' ("Art of speaking and writing")
* ''Nāmah-i bāstān'' ("Book of ancient times")
* ''Āyīnah-i sekandarī'' ("Alexandrian mirror")
* ''Nāmah-i sukhanvārān'' ("Book of eloquent speakers"), or ''Āyīn-i sokhanvārī'' ("Rules of eloquence")
* ''Takvīn va tashrīʿ'' ("Creation and lawmaking")
* ''Sih maktūb'' ("Three letters")
* ''Sad khaṭābah'' ("One hundred lectures")

==== Mīrzā Malkum Khān ====

{{See also|Mirza Malkom Khan}}

Mīrzā Malkum Khān's [[Armenia]]n background and [[Christianity|Christian]] religion may have played a part in the simplicity of his Persian prose. In his most important literary-critical work, ''Firqah-i Kaj'bīnān'' ("the squint-eyed sect"), Malkum Khān lampooned the language of various classes of society and encouraged a more concise prose style.

* ''Firqah-i Kaj'bīnān'' ("the squint-eyed sect")

==== ʿAbd al-Rahīm Ṭālibūf ====

{{See also|Abd al-Rahim Talibuf}}

Ṭālibūf, along with the earlier critics mentioned above, recognized the didactic use of literature to instruct people. He also helped to establish a simpler prose style (''sādah'nivīsī'') "especially in scientific prose in Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Nukhbah-i sipihrī'' ("Best of the sphere")
* ''Kitāb-i Aḥmad yā ṣafīnah-i Ṭālibī'' ("The book of Aḥmad, or the Ṭalibī Anthology")
* ''Fīzīk yā ḥikmat-i ṭabīʿīyah'' ("Physics or the natural order")
* ''Hay'at-i jadīd'' ("Modern life")
* ''Pandnāmah-i Mārkūs Uriliyūs, qayṣar-i rūm'' ("Book of Counsels of Marcus Aurelius, Caesar of Rome")
* ''Masālik al-muhsinīn'' ("Principles of Beneficents")
* ''Masā'il al-ḥayāt'' ("Questions of life")
* ''Izāhat dar khuṣūṣ-i āzādī'' ("Explanations on liberty")
* ''Siyāsat-i Ṭālibī'' ("The politics of Ṭālibī")

==== Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn Marāghah'ī ====
In his ''Sīyāhat'nāmah-i Ibrāhīm Bayk'', Marāghah'ī stressed love of country. "He found [[Persian literature]] preoccupied with love and lyricism and negligent of social and national issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marāghah'ī put his simple prose style into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Sīyāhat'nāmah-i Ibrāhīm Bayk''

'''Lombardic capitals''' is the name given to a type of decorative [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters used in inscriptions and, typically, at the start of a section of text in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=David|title=The Art of Calligraphy: a practical guide to the skills and techniques|date=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780751301496|pages=62–4|edition= 1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Shaw describes it as a 'relative' of uncial writing.&lt;ref name="Black Letter Primer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Black Letter Primer: an introduction to Gothic alphabets|date=1982|publisher=Taplinger Pub.

A characteristic form of text decoration in manuscripts and early printed books with hand colouring was to use alternating red and blue Lombardic capitals for the start of each successive paragraph.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellinga|first1=Lotte|title=Incunabula in Transit: People and Trade|date=2018|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|isbn=978-90-04-34036-7|pages=183–184|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMZKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, fonts of Lombardic capitals have been designed by many [[typographers]], such as [[Frederic Goudy]], who included a set as an alternative uppercase for his Goudy Text font.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goudy Text Lombardic Capitals|url=https://catalog.monotype.com/font/monotype/goudy-text/lombardic-capitals|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=First, Lombardic, or the national hand of Italy, which was a development of the uncial and was first used in northern Italy. The Lombardic character is a most useful and interesting form and presents less of the fixed quality of the Roman. There are many and wide variations of it as developed by the scribes in different countries. It was the favorite form selected for initials and versals in manuscripts, which were usually painted in, in colors and gold, the solidity of the bodystrokes making it especially adaptable for this purpose. At its best this Lombardic letter preserves much of the feeling of the uncials of the sixth and seventh centuries.

'''Music Law''' refers to legal aspects of the music industry, and certain legal aspects in other sectors of the entertainment industry. The music industry includes [[record label]]s, music publishers, merchandisers, the live events sector and of course performers and artists.

The terms "music law" and "entertainment law", along with "business affairs", are used by the music and entertainment industry and should not be thought of as academic definitions. Indeed, music law covers a range of traditional legal subjects including [[intellectual property]] law ([[copyright]] law, [[trademark]]s, image publicity rights, design rights), [[competition law]], [[bankruptcy law]], [[contract law]], [[defamation]] and, for the live events industry, [[immigration law]], [[health and safety law]], and licensing.

==Definitions==
*A "compilation" refers to work formed from already existing materials in a way that forms its own original work, including collective works.
*"Copies" are physical objects that hold, fix, or embody a work such as a music tape, film, CD, statue, play, or printed sheet music.
*"Sound recordings" can refer to any audio recording including the sound accompanying motion pictures.
*"Copyright owner" is the entity that legally owns rights to a work.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title=Copyright Law of the United States - U.S. Copyright Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Performance" The copyright holder has the exclusive right to perform the work in public, or to license others to perform it. The right applies to “literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works.".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106(4)&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a CD in public, or showing a film in public is "performing" the work.

==Copyright==

{{main| copyright}}

==Publishing==

Publishing is the primary source of income for musicians writing their own music.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Money collected from the 'publishing' rights is ultimately destined for songwriters - the composers of works, whether or not they are the recording artist or performer. Often, [[songwriter]]s will work for a musical ensemble to help them with musical aspects of the composition, but here again, the writer of the song is the owner of it and will own the copyrights in the song and thus will be entitled to the publishing revenues.  Copyrights in compositions are not the same as [[sound recording]]s.  A recording artist can record a song and sell it to another band or company. As a result, that particular company will own the recording, but not the song. The original writer will always maintain the copyright for that particular song. The publishing money is connected to the copyright, so the owner will be the only one making money off of the song itself. All successful songwriters will join a collection society (such as ASCAP and BMI in the USA, SOCAN in Canada, JASRAC in Japan, GEMA in Germany and PRS for Music in the UK, etc.) and many will enter into agreements with music publishing companies who will exploit their works on the songwriters behalf for a share of ownership, although many of these deals involve the transfer (assignment) of copyright from the songwriter to the music publisher.

Both the recorded music sector and music publishing sector have their foundations in [[intellectual property]] law and all of the major recording labels and major music publishers and many independent record labels and publishers have dedicated "business and legal affairs" departments with in-house lawyers whose role is not only to secure intellectual property rights from recording artists, performers and songwriters but also to exploit those rights and protect those rights on a global basis. There are a number of specialist independent law firms around the world who advise on music and entertainment law whose clients include recording artists, performers, producers, songwriters, labels, music publishers, stage and set designers, choreographers, graphic artists, games designers, merchandisers, broadcasters, artist managers, distributors, collection societies and the live events sector (which further includes festivals, venues, promoters, booking agents and production service providers such as lighting and staging companies).

==Performance Licensing==
{{main|Music licensing}}

==Business==

The US Government views artists that give concerts and sell merchandise as a business. Bands that tour internationally will also face a plethora of legislation around the world including health and safety laws, immigration laws and tax legislation. Also, many relationships are governed by often complex contractual agreements.

In the US it is important for musicians to get legal business licenses. These can be obtained at a city hall or local government center. The business license will require the tracking of sales, wages, and gigs. A tax ID is also necessary for all businesses. Musicians that fail to comply with the tax ID process and do not report their profits and losses to the government can face serious consequences with the IRS.

'''Music licensing''' is the [[license]]d use of [[copyright]]ed [[music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scherer|first1=Dana A.|title=Money for Something: Music Licensing in the 21st Century|date=January 19, 2016|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43984.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Music licensing is intended to ensure that the owners of copyrights on musical works are compensated for certain uses of their work. A purchaser has limited rights to use the work without a separate agreement.

==Definitions==
The following words and phrases appear in discussion of music licensing:
;license : the right, granted by the copyright holder or his/her agent, for the broadcast, recreation, or performance of a copyrighted work. Types of licensing contracts can include: 1) a flat fee for a defined period of usage, or 2) royalty payments determined by the number of copies of the work sold or the total revenues acquired as a result of its distribution. In addition to a basic fee, most music licensing agreements require additional payments to the copyright owner when the work in which it is included (movie, play) is financially successful above a certain threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rMFSUTNWRzgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=music+licensing&amp;ots=RJTlocjJkp&amp;sig=JtOtE3R0_M2oAOLUrSUOyxyWEns#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20licensing&amp;f=false |title=Kohn on music licensing - Al Kohn, Bob Kohn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2002-01-15 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;licensor : the owner of the licensed work
;licensee : the person or entity to whom the work is licensed
;performance : the public performance of a musical piece, whether live or recorded, performed by the original artist or someone else, whether the performance keeps to the original version or is adapted or changed in some manner. Playing a music CD (or tape, etc.) in public is "performing" the work. 
;broadcast : playing live or recorded works, including radio, TV, [[webcasting]], [[podcasting]], etc., to multiple listeners in a setting such as a bar or bookstore. (Using that definition and the previous one leads to phrases like 'live broadcast performance'.)
;performing rights organization : large companies that hold performance rights for copyrighted musical works. The best-known are [[ASCAP|American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI), [[SESAC|Society of European Stage Authors and Composers]] (SESAC), and La Asociación de Compositores y Editores de Música Latinoamericana (The Association of Composers and Publishers of Latin American Music, ACEMLA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acemla.com/ Retrieved 2014-12-30&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, the [[PRS for Music]], and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] for licensing recordings and music videos. The companies license public performance on a nonexclusive basis of the music they own or hold under contract using a complex weighting formula to distribute the fees to the respective rights holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/music-licensing3.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How Music Licensing Works" |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date=2003-08-22 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license may be a blanket license, but individual licenses may be negotiated.

Rights organizations sample radio and television broadcasts, offer blanket licenses to broadcasters, and investigate complaints to detect and prevent unauthorized performances.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the history of the origin and practices of ASCAP, see Jeff Lunden, Collecting Money for Songwriters, A 100-Year Tug of War, NPR (Feb. 13, 2014); https://www.npr.org/2014/02/13/275920416/collecting-money-for-songwriters-a-100-year-tug-of-war; Retrieved Jan. 5, 2015. A less flattering view of the practices of such organizations can be found in Harvey Reid, ASCAP &amp; BMI – Protectors of Artists or Shadowy Thieves? http://www.woodpecker.com/writing/essays/royalty-politics.html; Retrieved Jan. 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, ASCAP and BMI hire field agents to monitor public performances. The field agents may act as agents for the organization, negotiating a fee for a blanket license, but individuals may negotiate directly with the organization. The fee may be presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, but in case of disagreement, the fee may be appealed to the Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York.

;pre-cleared music: music that is covered under a prior agreement allowing distribution and legal use under specific circumstances. The license may be for use in film, video, television (commercials and programs), Internet, events in live venues, video games and multimedia productions.
;copyright : literally, 'the right to copy.' The owner of a [[copyright]] has five exclusive rights: reproduction (copying), preparing derivative works (adaptation), distributing copies to the public, performing the work publicly, and displaying the work in public. Prior to 1886, no effective international law of copyright existed. The first major international copyright law conventions were the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] created in 1886. In the US, for works created in 1977 and after the work is protected by copyright when it is "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," without the need to register it with the US Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §102(a)&lt;/ref&gt; A work must be registered, however, before a copyright owner may bring suit for infringement.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 411(a)&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[synchronization rights|synchronization licensing]] : the licensing of musical works to be synchronized with moving pictures as background in a motion picture, television program, video, DVD, etc.
;master use licensing: the licensing of the recording of a musical work to be performed as a soundtrack, bumper, lead-in or background to a motion picture.
;publisher : for the purposes of copyright, a publisher is the owner of the copyrighted work. It is now standard practice for songwriters of even the slightest prominence to form a publishing company as a separate legal entity to hold the rights to their work. Continued use of the, now somewhat anachronistic, term "publisher" reflects the state of media at the time of the Berne Convention, when all music distribution was done on paper as sheet music or player piano rolls.

==Broadcasting==

Broadcasting, in the context of music licensing, means the playback of recorded or live music for groups of people beyond what might be normally expected in a social setting. Legal claims are filed frequently against bookstores, bars, and live music venues that broadcast music without first obtaining a performance license.

The music broadcast in grocery stores and elevators is a service purchased from one of many organizations that offer it (the largest is [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]). Part of the fee paid for the service is used to cover licensing costs. Except in very narrowly defined circumstances, noted below under the Section 110 "small business exception," a business, restaurant, or store that plays radio broadcasts or shows TV programs in the premises does not pay a licensing fee.

Radio stations pay fees to licensing bodies for nonexclusive rights to broadcast music.  Radio stations and businesses typically pay a flat rate once a year, called a blanket license, which can vary based on the size of the audience, value of the advertising revenues, and amount and nature of music usage. As part of the license contract a radio station may conduct periodic audits of the music being played, with the audit results submitted to the licensing body.

==Home video==

Licensing issues are encountered when [[television]] shows or [[films]] using [[copyrighted]] music are released on [[DVD]] format.

When a song is cleared for usage on a TV show, historically to save money, the clearance typically applies only to television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is considered for DVD distribution to the home video market, the rights to the song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD. Most producers/production companies now include the rights for DVDs or "all media now known or hereafter devised," which assures production companies of the right to re-release without incurring additional licensing fees.

If the process of clearing the rights to the song is prohibitively expensive for the home video distributor, or clearance is refused by the copyright holders of the original song, the affected song is either replaced with a similar one, or the footage containing the copyrighted song is edited out. In a few cases, television shows, with extensive use of copyrighted music whose cost of "after-market" licensing is high, are withheld from release on DVD; notable examples include ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[Third Watch]]'' (beyond its first two seasons), and ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', some of which were eventually released after long delays. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/articles/holdup.cfm  - The "What's The Hold-up?"

== Live performance ==

With certain exceptions, live performances must be licensed. In the US, the owner of a bar, cafe, or restaurant who wants to have live music usually will obtain a blanket license from ASCAP or BMI to play musical selections which they control. If a license is obtained from one company but not the other, only the music from that company may be performed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barbusinessowner.com/public/Music-Licensing-for-Bars-and-Restaurants.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Concert Bands (ACB)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acbands.org/&lt;/ref&gt; offers a blanket license to community bands that covers both ASCAP and BMI lists. At the end of the year, the band completes a spreadsheet showing how often each song was played during the year, which the ACB submits to the rights organizations.

== Performance Licensing ==
Purchasing a copy of the sheet music for a copyrighted work does not give the purchaser the right to perform the music. A separate performance license must be obtained. Someone who listens to a piece of music and learns to play it must obtain a performance license before performing it in public in a commercial setting. A new arrangement for a copyrighted work is a derivative work.

Permission of the rights holder is required before the work may be published, copied, or performed in public. (There now may be two copyrights, one on the original work and a second copyright on the "new" material contributed by the arranger.) An arrangement of a traditional song or piece of music will be protected by copyright even if the original piece is in the public domain. Every new arrangement receives a copyright.&lt;ref&gt;ASCAP has over 40 arrangements of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata under license, and nearly 80 versions of Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Harvey Reid, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions to the requirement for a performance license. One set of exceptions come under the [[Fair use]] doctrine. Another set of exceptions are situations covered under Section 110 of the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110 and http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair use exemption ===

The fair use exemption is an ill-defined, fact-based doctrine, decided by courts on a case-by-case basis. It has very limited applicability in the area of music performance and makes a weak defense in an infringement case. The use of a copyrighted work "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright." &lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 107&lt;/ref&gt; There is no way in which the public, unlicensed performance of an entire piece of music can be brought under the protection of Section 107. In spite of folk wisdom to the contrary, there is no "three second rule" for copying or sampling recorded music. There is no rule that "four notes" can be copied without penalty. Instances under the fair use exception might include criticism or comment. Criticism need not be negative: if a jazz soloist quotes a phrase from a well-known solo by another player, it might be viewed as an homage.&lt;ref&gt;However, see Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., 585 F.3d 267 (6th Cir. 2009), in which the court rejected the "fair use" argument that the use of music sampling was an "homage" to the original recording.&lt;/ref&gt; Music sampling has been aggressively pursued by copyright holders as a form of "free riding" but might be interpreted as a transformative use.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Rinkerman, Sampling Unleashed? Migrating Visual Art Fair Use Principles Into the Music Space. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2540345. Accessed Jan. 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Section 110 exemptions ===

Section 110 sets out eleven situations in which performance of a work, including broadcast, "are not infringements of copyright" &lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110; available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110&lt;/ref&gt; The major exemptions are outlined in paragraphs 1 to 5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 cover face-to-face instruction, or "distance learning," in non-profit educational settings. Paragraph 3 applies to performance or display in religious settings as part of a worship service. Paragraph 4 applies to non-dramatic literary or musical works (but not plays or video) performed by non-profit groups such as a community band or orchestra. Paragraph 5 is the "small business" exemption.

A performance license need not be obtained if the work is performed or displayed "by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational institution."&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

A film shown as part of a fundraiser, or a film series might not qualify as "face-to-face teaching activities." Instruction given to corporate or government employees would not qualify as a "nonprofit educational institution."

Paragraph 2 creates a similar exemption for distance learning. A work may be performed or displayed through transmission to students enrolled in a course, or to government employees as part of their duties, without requiring a performance license.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C.§ 110(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption does not apply to works produced and sold for online distance learning. The performance or display must be made under the direction of the instructor and directly related to, and in aid of, what is being taught: it cannot be used as a pretext for transmission of other works. Nondramatic literary or musical works may be performed in their entirety. For other works, such as display of a film or painting, the performance must be "reasonable and limited." The exemption applies only to distance learning that is part of scheduled classes. Works that are simply posted by an instructor would not be protected. The educational institution must meet certain additional conditions. It must provide information to faculty, students, and relevant staff members describing US copyright law and promoting compliance. For digital transmissions, the institution must take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized retention or further distribution of copies of the work such as not interfering with any technological means the copyright owner may have used to prevent copying.

Paragraph 3 creates an exemption for performance of nondramatic literary works, musical works, or dramatico-musical works of a religious nature, or display of a work, as part of religious services at a place of worship or religious assembly.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. 110 § 110(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 110 (4) creates an exemption for non-profit groups for performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work (but not a play or an opera) if four conditions are met:
	1) the work may be performed but may not be transmitted to the public,
	2) none of the performers, organizers, or promoters are paid,
	3) there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and,
	4) there is no admission charge, ''or'', after deducting for reasonable expenses the proceeds are used exclusively for educational, religious, or charitable purposes.
	The last condition may not be met if the copyright owner has objected by serving written notice to the performing organization which conforms to requirements outlined in the statute.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(4)((B)(i through iii)&lt;/ref&gt; A performance by a non-profit may be recorded and the recording may be privately shared.  But posting the recording on a public service such as YouTube constitutes "transmission" within the terms of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The recording is "transmitted" when it is posted, whether or not anyone ever plays it.&lt;ref&gt;In re Cellco Partnership, SDNY 2009, 663 F.Supp.2d 363, 92 USPQ 2d 1113.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not a trivial consideration.  Popular cell phone apps, such as Shazam, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.shazam.com/ Last checked 10/17/17.&lt;/ref&gt; and other readily available programs make it possible to automate identification of music posted on public sites.

Paragraph 5 is the "small business exemption," which allows bars, cafes, and restaurants to play the radio or show television programming as "background" in their business. It does not authorize playing recorded music such as using a CD player, or live musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(5); Todd B. Tatelman, Copyright Law’s ‘Small Business Exception": Public Performance Exemptions for Certain Establishments. CRS Report RS21107, http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/rs21107.pdf, updated December 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption covers reception of a public transmission on a single receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in the home if no direct charge is made and the performance is not further transmitted to the public. Very specific limitations are outlined in the statute, such as number of loudspeakers permitted and square footage of the establishment.

A governmental body, or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization, may perform nondramatic musical works in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair without obtaining a performance license.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(6)&lt;/ref&gt;

A public vending establishment may perform nondramatic musical works to promote the sale of copies of the work if there is no admission charge. The performance may not be transmitted beyond the immediate area the sale occurs.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(7)&lt;/ref&gt;

A nondramatic literary work may be performed or transmitted to blind persons or other handicapped persons who are unable to read normal printed material, or to deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable to hear the aural signals accompanying a transmission of visual signals if the performance is made without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and the transmission is made through the facilities of a governmental body, a non-commercial educational broadcast station, a "subcarrier" of an FM broadcast station or a cable system.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(8)&lt;/ref&gt;

A single performance of a dramatic literary work may be transmitted specifically for the blind or other handicapped persons if the work was published at least 10 years before the date of the performance, there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and the transmission is made through an FM radio subcarrier as defined in paragraph 8.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §110(9)&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work in the course of a social function organized and promoted by a nonprofit veterans’ organization or a nonprofit fraternal organization is exempt. Social functions of college or university sororities or fraternities are not included under the exemption unless the social function is held solely to raise funds for a specific charitable purpose.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(10)&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 11 permits muting or skipping limited portions of the audio or video portions of a motion picture which is transmitted to a household for private viewing. Creating or providing a computer program which facilitates muting or skipping is also permitted, provided no alteration is made in the content, and provided no fixed copy of the altered version is created.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(11)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Happy Birthday to You"==
The song "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" is one of the best known songs in the world and generated over $2 million in royalties each year for its purported copyright owners even though the copyright has now been ruled invalid.  In September 2015, a judge ruled that the copyright was invalid, and on February 8, 2016, [[Warner/Chappell Music]]  agreed to settle a class action lawsuit brought to challenge these fees. After mediation, Warner will pay more than $14 million to the "thousands of people and entities" who had paid licensing fees to use the song since 1949, plus $4.6 million to attorneys for the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021216/happy-birthday-you-belongs-everyone-now.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASCAP and Girl Scouts==
In 1995,  [http://www.ascap.com/ The American Society of Composers(ASCAP)] ordered [[American Camp Association|The American Camping Association]] to pay royalties for campfire songs sung at any of their 2300 camps. Girl Scout camps were included in the request, but only a small number of Girl Scout camps actually paid the $250 agreed upon yearly fee. The ''New York Times'' reported, "Among the 256 Girl Scout camps on its list, 16 did."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-1"/&gt; In March 1996, ASCAP sent letters to the Girl Scouts to pay copy right fees for campfire songs written or published by ASCAP sung in "public performance."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-2"/&gt; ASCAP  expected to be paid license fees for any of the  4 million songs included list sung publicly.

The songs on this list include "Puff the Magic Dragon" and "This Land is your land."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

In August 1996, The ''Wall Street Journal'' published a frontpage article, "Ascap Cautions the Girl Scouts: Don't Sing 'God Bless America,'" describing the scene at Diablo Day Camp in [[Lafayette, California]], as a troupe of Girl Scouts danced to the ''[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]'' in silence for fear of copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; A public relations situation for ASCAP occurred, as the video performance of Girl Scouts silently dancing made its way onto mainstream news.

ASCAP confronted the Girl Scouts because of the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], which established that any song used in public performance would be able to receive royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins III|first1=Julien H.|title=When in Doubt, Do Without: Licensing Public Performances By nonprofit Camping or Volunteer Service Organizations Under Federal Copyright Law|journal=Washington University Law Review|date=1997|volume=75|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' describes the law as this: "The law defines a public performance as 'where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.'"

ASCAP quickly sent a press statement claiming that it never intended on receiving royalties and ''has never brought nor threatened to bring suit against the Girl Scouts.''&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; ASCAP promised to reimburse any Girl Scout camp for the royalty fees that they may have paid. It was also reported that "in 1940 [[Irving Berlin]] had donated all future royalties from "God Bless America" to the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts." &lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

By September 1996, Girl Scout executives in New York said they believed "this unfortunate situation is resolved."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-2"/&gt;

'''Music therapy''' is the use of [[music]] to improve health or functional outcomes. Music therapy is a [[creative arts therapies|creative arts therapy]], consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, [[motor skills]], emotional development, communication, [[sensory perception|sensory]], [[social skills]], and [[quality of life]] by using both active and receptive music experiences such as improvisation, re-creation, composition, and listening and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and quantitative research literature base. 
Some commonly found practices include developmental work (communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with special needs, [[songwriting]] and listening in reminiscence/orientation work with the elderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmic [[brainwave synchronization|entrainment]] for physical rehabilitation in stroke victims. Music therapy is also used in some medical hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, and correctional facilities &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music.aspx][http://www.musictherapy.org/about/quotes/ "About Music Therapy &amp; AMTA"]. American Music Therapy Association, 2011. November 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

Music has been found to be an effective tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music.aspx|title=Music as medicine|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been carried out on patients diagnosed different mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and schizophrenia and there has been a visible improvement in their mental health after the therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCaffrey T, Edwards J, Fannon D | date=2011|title=Is there a role for music therapy in the recovery approach in mental health? |journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|volume=38|issue=3|pages=185–189|doi=10.1016/j.aip.2011.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches used in music therapy that have emerged from the field of music education include [[Orff-Schulwerk]] (Orff), Dalcroze [[eurhythmics]], and [[Kodály method]]. Models that developed directly out of music therapy are [[neurologic music therapy]] (NMT), [[Nordoff-Robbins music therapy]] and the Bonny method of [[guided imagery]] and music.&lt;ref name=Davis2008&gt;{{cite book | first1 = William Barron | last1 = Davis | first2 = Kate E. | last2 = Gfeller | first3 = Michael H. | last3 = Thaut | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |title=An introduction to music therapy: theory and practice|edition=Third |at=Part 3: The music therapy treatment process |publisher=American Music Therapy Association |location=Silver Spring, Maryland|OL=15594340W}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ rp|460–468}}

Music therapists may work with individuals who have behavioral-emotional disorders.[http://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1786&amp;context=msw_papers]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deka|first=Ankur|title=Inner power of music and music therapy|url=http://www.efi-news.com/2012/04/inner-power-of-music-and-music-therapy.html|work=Efi-news.com|access-date=April 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508044032/http://www.efi-news.com/2012/04/inner-power-of-music-and-music-therapy.html|archive-date=May 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} To meet the needs of this population, music therapists have taken current psychological theories and used them as a basis for different types of music therapy. Different models include behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.&lt;ref name=Davis2008/&gt;{{rp|469–473}} The therapist has an ongoing responsibility to evaluate the extent to which the client is achieving the goals of therapy and whether the methods of therapy being used are helping or hindering the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining Music Therapy|last=Bruscia|first=Kenneth|publisher=Barcelona Publishers|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One therapy model based on neuroscience, called "neurologic music therapy" (NMT), is "based on a neuroscience model of music perception and production, and the influence of music on functional changes in non-musical brain and behavior functions".&lt;ref name=Davis2008/&gt;{{rp|475}} In other words, NMT studies how the brain is without music, how the brain is with music, measures the differences, and uses these differences to cause changes in the brain through music that will eventually affect the client non-musically. As Michael Thaut put it: "The brain that engages in music is changed by engaging in music."&lt;ref name=Davis2008/&gt;{{rp|475}} NMT trains motor responses (i.e. tapping foot or fingers, head movement, etc.) to better help clients develop motor skills that help "entrain the timing of muscle activation patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Roth |first=Edward |title=Neurologic music therapy |url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~eroth/NMT%20Overview.pdf |work=Academy of Neurologic Music Therapists, Western Michigan University |access-date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The two fundamental types of music therapy==
There are two fundamental types of music therapy: 'receptive music therapy', and 'active music therapy', which is sometimes called 'expressive music therapy'. Active music therapy engages clients or patients in the act of making vocal or instrumental music. Receptive music therapy guides patients or clients in listening to live or recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;Grocke, D., and Wigram, T., Receptive methods in music therapy: Techniques and clinical applications for music therapy clinicians, educators, and students. London, England: Jessica Kingsley, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nordoff-Robbins ===
{{main|Nordoff-Robbins music therapy}}
[[Paul Nordoff]], a [[Juilliard School]] graduate and Professor of Music, was a pianist and composer who, upon seeing disabled children respond so positively to music, gave up his academic career to further investigate the possibility of music as a means for therapy. [[Clive Robbins]], a special educator, partnered with Nordoff for over 17 years in the exploration and research of music’s effects on disabled children—first in the United Kingdom, and then in the USA in the 1950s and 60s. Their pilot projects included placements at care units for autistic children and child psychiatry departments, where they put programs in place for children with mental disorders, emotional disturbances, developmental delays, and other handicaps. Their success at establishing a means of communication and relationship with autistic children at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] gave rise to the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s first grant given of this nature, and the 5-year study "Music therapy project for psychotic children under seven at the day care unit" involved research, publication, training and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aigen|first1=Kenneth|title=Being in Music: Foundations of Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy|date=2005|publisher=Barcelona Publishers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3BLAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781891278372}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Several publications, including ''Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children'', ''Creative Music Therapy'', ''Music Therapy in Special Education'', as well as instrumental and song books for children, were released during this time. Nordoff and Robbins's success became known globally in the mental health community, and they were invited to share their findings and offer training on an international tour that lasted several years. Funds were granted to support the founding of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordoff-robbins.org.uk/ Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; in Great Britain in 1974, where a one-year graduate program for students was implemented. In the early eighties, a center was opened in Australia, and various programs and institutes for music therapy were founded in Germany and other countries. In the United States, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy was established at New York University in 1989.{{citation needed|reason=nothing questionable, but this is a long string of facts without any source listed. I wouldn't want to see this info deleted, just properly backed.|date=April 2016}}

The Nordoff-Robbins approach, based on the belief that everyone is capable of finding meaning in and benefitting from musical experience, is now practiced by hundreds of therapists internationally. It focuses on treatment through the creation of music by both therapist and client together. Various techniques are used to accommodate all capabilities so that even the most low functioning individuals are able to participate actively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nordoff-Robbins |url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/nordoff |website=NYU Steinhardt |publisher=New York University |access-date=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orff ===
{{see|Orff Schulwerk}}
Developed by Gertrude Orff at the Kindezentrum München, is another approach known as Orff Music Therapy. Both the clinical setting of social pediatrics as well as the [[Orff Schulwerk]] (schoolwork) approach in music education (developed by German composer [[Carl Orff]]) influence this method, which is used with children with developmental problems, delays and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Orff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voigt|first1=Melanie|title=Orff music therapy: an overview |journal=Voices: a world forum for music therapy |date=November 2003|volume=3|issue=3|doi=10.15845/voices.v3i3.134|url=https://voices.no/index.php/voices/article/view/134/110|access-date=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of social pediatrics was developed after the Second World War in Germany by Theodor Hellbrügge, who understood that medicine alone could not meet the complex needs of developmentally disabled children. He consulted psychologists, occupational therapists and other mental healthcare professionals whose knowledge and skills could aid in the diagnostics and treatment of children. Gertrude Orff was asked to develop a form of therapy based on the Orff Schulwerk approach to support the emotional development of patients. Elements found in both the music therapy and education approaches include the understanding of holistic music presentation as involving word, sound and movement; the use of both music and play improvisation as providing a creative stimulus for the child to investigate and explore; Orff instrumentation, including keyboard instruments and percussion instruments as a means of participation and interaction in a therapeutic setting; and lastly, the multisensory aspects of music used by the therapist to meet the particular needs of the child, such as both feeling and hearing sound.&lt;ref name="Orff" /&gt;

Corresponding with the attitudes of [[humanistic psychology]], the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths as well as their handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social paediatrics. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as ''responsive interaction'', in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, by having them participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.&lt;ref name="Orff" /&gt;

=== Bonny method of guided imagery in music ===
:''Further information: [[Guided imagery]]''
Music educator and therapist Helen Lindquist Bonny (1921 – May 25, 2010) developed an approach influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychological views, known as the Bonny method of guided imagery in music (GIM). [[Guided imagery]] refers to a technique used in natural and alternative medicine that involves using mental imagery to help with the physiological and psychological ailments of patients.&lt;ref name="voices.no"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonny|first1=Helen L.|title=Music psychotherapy: guided imagery and music |journal=Voices: a world forum for music therapy |date=April 2001 |volume=10 |issue=3 |doi=10.15845/voices.v10i3.568 |url=https://voices.no/index.php/voices/article/view/568/437 |access-date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner often suggests a relaxing and focusing image and through the use of imagination and discussion, aims to find constructive solutions to manage their problems. Bonny applied this psychotherapeutic method to the field of music therapy by using music as the means of guiding the patient to a higher state of consciousness where healing and constructive self- awareness can take place. Music is considered a "co-therapist" because of its importance. GIM with children can be used in one-on-one or group settings, and involves relaxation techniques, identification and sharing of personal feeling states, and improvisation to discover the self, and foster growth. The choice of music is carefully selected for the client based on their musical preferences and the goals of the session. Usually a classical piece, it must reflect the age and attentional abilities of the child in length and genre, and a full explanation of the exercises must be offered at their level of understanding.&lt;ref name="voices.no" /&gt;

The use of guided imagery with autistic children has been found to decrease stereotypical behaviours and hyperactivity, increase attention and the ability to follow instructions, as well as increase self-initiated communication, both verbal and non-verbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kenneth E. |last1=Brescia |first2=Denise E. |last2=Grocke | name-list-format = vanc |title=Guided imagery and music: the Bonny method and beyond |date=2002 |publisher=Barcelona Publishers |isbn=9781891278129}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

== Characteristics of Music for Receptive Music Therapy ==
Bonny (Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music) writes a lot about the different features of music types in the classical genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Receptive Methods in Music Therapy : Techniques and Clinical Applications for Music Therapy Clinicians, Educators and Students|last=Grocke|first=Denise|last2=Wigram|first2=Tony|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=45–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical music can be multi-layered; melodic line, harmony structure and base line. All of these aspects work together with other things to create different layers of musical sound. Classical music is written in different forms: ternary form, sonata form, theme and variations, prelude and tone poem.

==== Ternary form ====
It is associated Baroque era. It is for therapy work; it forms a stable and safe musical container, where the repetition of the open section that is recognizable before the period of change.

==== Sonata Form ====
It is associated with the Classical and Romantic era. It is composed of three parts: introduction, exposition, development and recapitulation (which may be in code).

==== Theme and variations ====
It uses different eras of music composition. The melody may be played by different instruments; played in different register (high, medium, low). It might become elongated by making each note twice is original length or shortened by making each note half the length.

==== Prelude ====
It is a short piece for an orchestra that is already completed. The most receptive music therapy is Debussy's Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, also Faure's Pavane for a Dead Princess.

==== Tone poem ====
This one is also from Romantic Era and also in the 20th century. Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life) and Enchanted Lake are great examples of this.

=== New Age Music ===
New Age Music is the type of music that allows relaxation while drawing images like landscapes enhanced by computer generated sounds.  Kobialkais a type of new age music that produces large volume music that has violins playing over the background of synthesizes sounds. It's often very relaxing because the quality is seamless.

=== Celtic Music ===
This is average in character, and sometimes there are vocal selection involved in Celtic music, adding to the appeal of the song choice. An example would be the Watermark by Enya. 12 minutes maybe be able to cause deep relaxation.

=== Meditative Music ===
Meditative music has a diverse range of styles and instrumentation. Most of them have single-line melody of a wooden or pan-flute.

=== Trance Music ===
Trance Music is the type of music that many musical therapists who work with adolescent-aged clients. Trance is a style of electronic dance music that was created in 1990s, and it has a tempo of 130 and 160 bpm. Trance music enhances a feeling of calmness despite the rapid pace.

=== Jazz Music ===
Jazz Music came out in the early part of the twentieth, generally known as the music of black Americans. The blues is a slow kind of jazz music that is used gentle relaxation. Jazz music is a sedative in receptive music therapy methods. Examples would be I Got Rhythm by Louie Armstrong or In a Mellotone by Duke Ellington.

== Approaches used with adolescents ==

Music therapy may be used with adolescent populations to treat disorders usually diagnosed in adolescence, such as mood/anxiety disorders and eating disorders, or inappropriate behaviors, including suicide attempts, withdrawal from family, social isolation from peers, aggression, running away, and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=Yinger&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Olivia |last1=Swedberg Yinger |first2=Lori |last2=Gooding |title=Music Therapy and Music Medicine for Children and Adolescents |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics |publisher=Elsevier |date=July 2014 |volume=23 |pages=535–553 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2013.03.003 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056499313000175 |access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keen&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexander W. |last=Keen MSocSc |title=Using music as a therapy tool to motivate troubled adolescents |journal=Social work in health care |date=March 2005 |volume=39:3–4 |pages=361–373 |doi=10.1300/J010v39n03_09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals in treating adolescents with music therapy, especially for those at high risk, often include: increased recognition and awareness of emotions and moods, improved decision-making skills, opportunities for creative self expression, decreased anxiety, increased self-confidence, improved self-esteem, and better listening skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music Therapy with High Risk Adolescents (PDF) |url=https://msu.edu/~msuamtas/scott_handout.pdf |website=American Music Therapy Association, Michigan State University Chapter |publisher=Michigan State University |access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====

Two main methods for music therapy in this age group are group meetings and individual sessions. Both methods may include listening to music, discussions concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, analyzing the meanings of specific songs, writing lyrics, composing music, performing music, and musical improvisation.&lt;ref name=Keen/&gt;

Private individual sessions can provide personal attention and are most effective when the music used is preferred by the patient. Using music that an adolescent can relate to or connect with can be successful in helping adolescent patients view the therapist as a safe and trustworthy adult, and to engage in the therapeutic process with less resistance.&lt;ref name=Keen/&gt; Music therapy conducted in groups affords opportunities for an adolescent individual to feel a sense of belonging, to express their opinions, learn how to socialize and verbalize appropriately with peers, improve compromising skills, and develop tolerance and empathy.&lt;ref name=Yinger/&gt;  Group sessions emphasize cooperation and cohesion, and can be quite effective in working with adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bednarz LF, Nikkel B  | year = 1992 | title = The role of music therapy in the treatment of young adults diagnosed with mental illness and substance abuse | url = | journal = Music Therapy Perspectives | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 21–26 | doi=10.1093/mtp/10.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment ===
Assessment includes obtaining a full medical history, musical (ability to duplicate a melody or identify changes in rhythm, etc.) and nonmusical functioning (social, physical/motor, emotional, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowe|first1=Barbara J.|title=Music Therapy for Children, Adolescents and Adults with Mental Disorders|date=2007|publisher=American Music Therapy Association, Inc.|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|isbn=1-884914-18-7|pages=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowe|first1=Barbara J.|title=Music Therapy for Children, Adolescents and Adults with Mental Disorders|date=2007|publisher=American Music Therapy Association, Inc.|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|isbn=1-884914-18-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In infants born prematurely ====
[[Preterm birth|Premature infants]] are those born at 37 weeks or less gestational stage. They are subject to numerous health risks, such as abnormal breathing patterns, decreased body fat and muscle tissue, as well as feeding issues. The coordination for sucking and breathing is often not fully developed, making feeding a challenge. The improved developmental activity and behavioural status of premature infants when they are discharged from the NICU, is directly related to the stimulation programs and interventions they benefited from during hospitalization, such as music therapy.

Music is typically conducted by a musical therapist in the [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU), with five main techniques designed to benefit premature infants:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Anthony|title=Developments in Music Therapy Practices: Case Study Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Barcelona Publishers|location=New Hampshire|isbn=978-1-891278-75-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}
# '''Live or recorded music''': Live or recorded music has been effective in promoting respiratory regularity and oxygen saturation levels, as well as decreasing signs of neonatal distress. Since premature infants have sensitive and immature sensory modalities, music is often performed in a gentle and controlled environment, either in the form of audio recordings or live vocalization, although live singing has been shown to have a greater effect. Live music also reduces the physiological responses in parents. Studies have shown that by combining live music, such as harp music, with the [[Kangaroo care|Kangaroo Care]], maternal anxiety is reduced. This allows for parents, especially mothers, to spend important time bonding with their premature infants. Female singing voices are also more effective at soothing premature infants. Despite being born premature, infants show a preference for the sound of a female singing voice, making it more beneficial than instrumental music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schlez A, Litmanovitz I, Bauer S, Dolfin T, Regev R, Arnon S | title = Combining kangaroo care and live harp music therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit setting | journal = The Israel Medical Association Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 354–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21809733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Promotion of healthy sucking reflex''': By using a [[Pacifier-activated lullaby|pacifier-activated lullaby device]], music therapists can help promote stronger sucking reflexes, while also reducing pain perception for the infant. The Gato Box is a small rectangular instrument that stimulates a prenatal heartbeat sound in a soft and rhythmic manner that has also been effective in aiding sucking behaviours.&lt;ref name="gato-pbs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loewy|first1=Dr. Joanne|title=Music and Medicine: Music Therapy for Infants|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/musicinstinct/video/music-and-medicine/music-therapy-for-infants/76/|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} The music therapist uses their fingers to tap on the drum, rather than using a mallet. The rhythm supports movement when feeding and promotes healthy sucking patterns. By improving sucking patterns, babies are able to coordinate the important dual mechanisms of breathing, sucking and swallowing needed to feed, thus promoting growth and weight gain. When this treatment proves effective, infants are able to leave the hospital earlier.
# '''Multimodal stimulation and music''': By combining music, such as lullabies, and multimodal stimulation, premature infants were discharged from the NICU sooner, than those infants who did not receive therapy. Multimodal stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in premature infant development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required to gain weight more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during multimodal stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Standley|first1=JM|title=The effect of music and multimodal stimulation on responses of premature infants in neonatal intensive care|journal=Paediatric Nursing|date=1998|volume=6|issue=24|pages=532–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the voice is a popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box. Both are used to stimulate the sounds of the womb. The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Florida Hospital Medical Centre|title=Music Therapists|url=https://www.floridahospital.com/children/experience/who-you-meet/music-therapists |publisher=Florida Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}
# '''Infant stimulation''': This type of intervention uses musical stimulation to compensate for the lack of normal environmental sensory stimulation found in the NICU. The sound environment the NICU provides can be disruptive; however, music therapy can mask unwanted auditory stimuli and promote a calm environment that reduces the complications for high-risk or [[Failure to thrive|failure-to-thrive]] infants. Parent-infant bonding can also be affected by the noise of the NICU, which in turn can delay the interactions between parents and their premature infants. But music therapy creates a relaxed and peaceful environment for parents to speak and spend time with their babies while incubated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krueger C, Horesh E, Crossland BA | title = Safe sound exposure in the fetus and preterm infant | journal = Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–70 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22834845 | pmc = 3665292 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2012.01342.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Parent-infant bonding''': Therapists work with parents so they may perform infant-directed singing techniques, as well as home care. Singing [[Lullaby|lullabies]] therapeutically can promote relaxation and decrease heart rate in premature infants. By calming premature babies, it allows for them to preserve their energy, which creates a stable environment for growth. Lullabies, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" or other culturally relevant lullabies, have been shown to greatly soothe babies. These techniques can also improve overall sleep quality, caloric intake and feeding behaviours, which aid in development of the baby while they are still in the NICU. Singing has also shown greater results in improving oxygen saturation levels for infants while incubated than has mothers' speech alone. This technique promoted high levels of oxygen for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Standley JM, Moore RS | title = Therapeutic effects of music and mother's voice on premature infants | journal = Pediatric Nursing | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 509–12, 574 | date = 1995 | pmid = 8700604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In children ====

Music therapy has multiple benefits which contribute to the maintenance of health and the drive toward [[physical rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] for children. Advanced technology that can monitor cortical activity offers a look at how music engages and produces changes in the brain during the perception and production of musical stimuli. Music therapy, when used with other rehabilitation methods, has increased the success rate of sensorimotor, cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LaGasse|first1=A. Blythe|last2=Thaut|first2=Michael H. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Music and Rehabilition:Neurological Approaches|journal=Music, health, and wellbeing.|date=April 15, 2012|pages=153–163|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586974.003.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Music therapy intervention programs can include an average of 18 sessions of treatment. The achievement of a physical rehabilitation goal relies on the child's existing motivation and feelings towards music and their commitment to engage in meaningful, rewarding efforts. Regaining full functioning also confides in the prognosis of recovery, the condition of the client, and the environmental resources available.  Both techniques use systematic processes where the therapists assist the client by using musical experiences and connections that collaborate as a dynamic force of change toward rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=Paul|last2=Ramsey|first2=David | name-list-format = vanc | title=Music therapy in physical medicine and rehabilitation.|journal=Australian Occupational Therapy Journal|date= November 15, 2012|pages=111–118|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1630.2000.00215.x|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has many calming and soothing properties that can be used as a sedative in rehabilitation. For example, a patient with chronic pain may decrease the physiological result of stress and draw attention away from the pain by focusing on music.&lt;ref name="Singamore Publishing"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Barksdale|first1 = Alicia L.|title = [[Music Therapy and Leisure for Persons with Disabilities]]|location = United States |publisher = [[Singamore Publishing]]|page = 13 |date = April 16, 2004|isbn = 1-57167-511-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self published inline|date=November 2017}}

Music therapy used in child rehabilitation has had a substantial emphasis on sensorimotor development including; balance and position, locomotion, agility, mobility, range of motion, strength, laterality and directionality.&lt;ref name="Singamore Publishing" /&gt;{{self published inline|date=November 2017}}  Music motivate and can be an element of distraction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;  Rhythmic stimuli has been found to help balance training for those with a brain injury.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Singing is a form of rehabilitation for neurological impairments. Neurological impairments following a brain injury can be in the form of [[apraxia]] – loss to perform purposeful movements, [[dysarthria]], muscle control disturbances (due to damage of the central nervous system), [[aphasia]] (defect in expression causing distorted speech), or language comprehension. Singing training has been found to improve lung, speech clarity, and coordination of speech muscles, thus, accelerating rehabilitation of such neurological impairments. For example, [[melodic intonation therapy]] is the practice of communicating with others by singing to enhance speech or increase speech production by promoting socialization, and emotional expression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Music therapy is thought to be helpful with children with [[autism spectrum]] by providing repetitive stimuli which aim to "teach" the brain other possible ways to respond that might be more useful as they grow older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Music Therapy, Sensory Integration and the Autistic Child | first = Dorita S. | last = Berger | name-list-format = vanc | location=Philadelphia |publisher=Berger |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self published inline|date=November 2017}}

== Older adults ==
== Medical disorders ==

=== Heart disease ===
According to a 2013 Cochrane review, listening to music may improve heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in those with [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD).&lt;ref name=Bradt2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bradt J, Dileo C, Potvin N | title = Music for stress and anxiety reduction in coronary heart disease patients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD006577 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24374731 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006577.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dementia ===
{{main|Music therapy for Alzheimer's disease}}
Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are among the disorders most commonly treated with music therapy. Like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of the most common significant effects are seen in social behaviors, leading to improvements in interaction, conversation, and other such skills. A meta-study of over 330 subjects showed music therapy produces highly significant improvements to social behaviors, overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and face recognition tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koger SM, Chapin K, Brotons M | title = Is Music Therapy an Effective Intervention for Dementia?A Meta-Analytic Review of Literature | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–15 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10519841 | doi = 10.1093/jmt/36.1.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many studies of MT's effectiveness, these positive effects on Alzheimer's and other dementias are not homogeneous among all studies. The effectiveness of the treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the patient, the quality and length of treatment, and other similar factors.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 2004 3–12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherratt K, Thornton A, Hatton C | title = Music interventions for people with dementia: a review of the literature | journal = Aging &amp; Mental Health | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14690862 | doi = 10.1080/13607860310001613275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meta-study examined the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has a soothing effect on the patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest that music serves as a sort of mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 2004 3–12" /&gt;

=== Aphasia ===
{{main|Music therapy for non-fluent aphasia}}
Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) is a method used by music therapists and [[speech-language pathology|speech-language pathologists]] to help people with [[communication disorders]] caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain by engaging the singing abilities and possibly engaging language-capable regions in the undamaged right hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Manasco/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Broca’s aphasia, or non-fluent aphasia, is a language disorder caused by damage to Broca’s area and surrounding regions in the left frontal lobe. &lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Wilson, S. M., Saygin, A. P., Dick, F., Sereno, M. I., Frank, R. T., &amp; Dronkers, N. F. 
(2003). Voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping. Nature Neuroscience,6, 448-450. doi:10.3897/bdj.4.e7720.figure2f
&lt;/ref&gt; Those with non-fluent aphasia are able to understand language fairly well, but they struggle with language production and syntax. &lt;ref&gt;Kolk, H., &amp; Heeschen, C. (1990). Adaptation symptoms and impairment symptoms in Brocas 
aphasia. Aphasiology,4(3), 221-231. doi:10.1080/02687039008249075&lt;/ref&gt; 

While unable to speak fluently, patients with non-fluent aphasia are often able to sing words, phrases, and even sentences they cannot express otherwise. &lt;ref&gt;Van Der Meulen, I., Van De Sandt-Koenderman, M.

Frontiers in human neuroscience, 10, 533. doi:10.3389/fnhum.2016.00533&lt;/ref&gt; MIT harnesses the singing ability of patients with non-fluent aphasia as a means to improve their communication. Although its exact nature depends on the therapist, in general MIT relies on the use of intonation (the rising and falling of the voice) and rhythm (beat/speed) to train patients to produce phrases verbally. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In MIT, common words and phrases are turned into melodic phrases, generally starting with two step sing-song patterns and eventually emulating typical speech intonation and rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name=Manasco&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manasco |first1=Hunter |title=Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders |date=2013 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9780763794170 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6ev-RBNEHYC&amp;pg=PA93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A therapist will usually begin by introducing an intonation to their patient through humming. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; They will accompany this humming with a rhythm produced by the tapping of the left hand. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the therapist will introduce a visual stimuli of the written phrase to be learned. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist then sings the phrase with the patient, and ideally the patient is eventually able to sing the phrase on their own. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; With much repetition and through a process of “inner-rehearsal” (practicing internally hearing one’s voice singing), a patient may eventually be able to produce the phrase verbally without singing. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the patient advances in therapy, the procedure can be adapted to give them more autonomy and to teach them more complex phrases. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of MIT, a non-fluent aphasic patient can be taught numerous phrases which aid them to communicate and function during daily life. 

The mechanisms of this success are yet to be fully understood. It is commonly agreed that while speech is lateralized mostly to the left hemisphere (for right-handed and most left-handed individuals), some speech functionality is also distributed in the right hemisphere. &lt;ref&gt;Dykova, G. M., Glozman, Z. M., Titova, E. Y., Krishev, E. S., &amp; Gamaleya, A. A. (2010). Speech disorders in right-hemisphere stroke. Neuroscience Behavior Physiology, 40(6), 593-602. doi:10.3897/bdj.4.e7720.figure2f&lt;/ref&gt; MIT is thought to stimulate these right language areas through the activation of music processing areas also in the right hemisphere &lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the rhythmic tapping of the left hand stimulates the right sensorimotor cortex in order to further engage the right hemisphere in language production. &lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, by stimulating the right hemisphere during language tasks, therapists hope to decrease dependence on the left hemisphere for language production.&lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While results are somewhat contradictory, studies have in fact found increased right hemispheric activation in non-fluent aphasic patients after MIT.&lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; This change in activation has been interpreted as evidence of decreased dependence on the left hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate, however, if changes in right hemispheric activation are part of the therapeutic process during/after MIT, or are simply a side effect of non-fluent aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Belin, P., Zilbovicius, M., Remy, P., Francois, C., Guillaume, S., Chain, F., ...Samson, Y. 
(1996). Recovery from nonfluent aphasia after melodic intonation therapy: A PET study. Neurology,47(6), 1504-1511. doi:10.1212/wnl.47.6.1504&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of making MIT more effective, researchers are continually studying the mechanisms of MIT and non-fluent aphasia.

Neurological researchers Sparks, Helm, and Albert developed MIT in 1973.&lt;ref name=Manasco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albert ML, Sparks RW, Helm NA | title = Melodic intonation therapy for aphasia | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 130–1 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4717723 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.1973.00490260074018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychiatric disorders ==

A 2016 meta-analysis-analysis on the use of music therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia found that the treatment effect was significantly better in the patients who received adjunct music therapy than in those who did not, in negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and also positive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng PT, Chen YW, Lin PY, Tu KY, Wang HY, Cheng YS, Chang YC, Chang CH, Chung W, Wu CK | title = Significant treatment effect of adjunct music therapy to standard treatment on the positive, negative, and mood symptoms of schizophrenic patients: a meta-analysis | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 16 | pages = 16 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26812906 | pmc = 4728768 | doi = 10.1186/s12888-016-0718-8 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0718-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 Cochrane review found that moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the quality of the music therapy provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geretsegger M, Mössler KA, Bieleninik Ł, Chen XJ, Heldal TO, Gold C | title = Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | pages = CD004025 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28553702 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004025.pub4 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD004025/SCHIZ_music-therapy-schizophrenia-or-schizophrenia-disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage by region ==

=== Africa ===

In 1999, the first program for music therapy in Africa opened in Pretoria, South Africa. Research has shown that in Tanzania patients can receive palliative care for life-threatening illnesses directly after the diagnosis of these illnesses. This is different from many Western countries, because they reserve palliative care for patients who have an incurable illness. Music is also viewed differently between Africa and Western countries. In Western countries and a majority of other countries throughout the world, music is traditionally seen as entertainment whereas in many African cultures, music is used in recounting stories, celebrating life events, or sending messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Ruth|title=Music in West Africa : Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Australia ===
One of the first groups known to heal with sound were the aboriginal people of Australia. The modern name of their healing tool is the didgeridoo, but it was originally called the yidaki. The yidaki produced sounds that are similar to the sound healing techniques used in modern day. For at least 40,000 years, the healing tool was believed to assist in healing "broken bones, muscle tears and illnesses of every kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stuart-Reid|first1=Annaliese and John|title=Sound Healing- Ancient Sounds|url=http://www.tokenrock.com/sound_healing/sounds_of_the_ancients.php|website=Token Rock|publisher=TokenRock|access-date=05/08/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, here are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo's exact age. Archaeological studies of [[rock art]] in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the [[Kakadu National Park|Kakadu]] region of the [[Northern Territory]] have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period. A clear rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the [[Arnhem Land]] plateau, from the freshwater period&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120421050045/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu/culture-history/art/styles.html Kakadu National Park – Rock art styles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (that had begun 1500 years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last1= Sayers  |first1= Andrew  |author-link1=  |year= 2001 |origyear= 2001 |title= Australian Art (Oxford History of Art) |type= paperback |series= Oxford History of Art |publisher= Oxford University Press, USA |publication-date= 19 July 2001 |page= 19  |isbn= 978-0192842145}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a didgeridoo player and two songmen participating in an Ubarr Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Chaloupka]], ''Journey in Time'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
Australia in 1949, music therapy (not clinical music therapy as understood today) was started through concerts organized by the Australian Red Cross along with a Red Cross Music Therapy Committee. The key Australian body, the [[Australian Music Therapy Association]] (AMTA), was founded in 1975.

===Canada===
In 1956, Fran Herman, one of Canada's music therapy pioneers, began a 'remedial music' program at the Home For Incurable Children, now known as the [[Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital]], in Toronto. Her group 'The Wheelchair Players' continued until 1964, and is considered to be the first music therapy group project in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voices.no/mainissues/mi40009000311.php Voices: Fran Herman, Music Therapist in Canada for over 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; Its production "The Emperor's Nightingale" was the subject of a documentary film.

Composer/pianist Alfred Rosé, a professor at the [[University of Western Ontario]], also pioneered the use of music therapy in [[London, Ontario]] at Westminster Hospital in 1952 and at the London Psychiatric Hospital in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alfred-rose-emc/ Canadian Encyclopedia: Alfred Rosé]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other music therapy programs were initiated during the 1950s; one by Norma Sharpe at St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], and the other by Thérèse Pageau at the Hôpital St-Jean-de-Dieu (now Hôpital Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine) in [[Montreal]].

A conference in August 1974, organized by Norma Sharpe and six other music therapists, led to the founding of the Canadian Music Therapy Association, which was later renamed the Canadian Association for Music Therapy (CAMT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/music-therapy-emc/ Canadian Encyclopedia: Music Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the organization had over 500 members.

Canada's first music therapy training program was founded in 1976, at Capilano College (now [[Capilano University]]) in [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]], by Nancy McMaster and Carolyn Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002520 Canadian Encyclopedia: Music Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway is widely{{peacock term|date=November 2017}} recognised as an important country for music therapy research. Its two major research centres are the Center for Music and Health&lt;ref&gt;http://nmh.no/en/research/centre_for_music_and_health&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Norwegian Academy of Music]] in [[Oslo]], and the [[Grieg Academy]] Centre for Music Therapy (GAMUT),&lt;ref&gt;http://uni.no/nb/uni-helse/gamut/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University of Bergen]]. The former was mostly developed by professor Even Ruud, while professor Brynjulf Stige is largely responsible for cultivating the latter. The centre in [[Bergen]] has 18 staff, including 2 professors and 4 associate professors, as well as lecturers and PhD students. Two of the field's major international research journals are based in Bergen: ''[[Nordic Journal for Music Therapy]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rnjm20/current&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Voices: A World Forum for Music Therapy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://voices.no/index.php/voices&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's main contribution to the field is mostly in the area of "community music therapy", which tends to be as much oriented toward [[social work]] as individual [[psychotherapy]], and music therapy research from this country uses a wide variety of methods to examine diverse methods across an array of social contexts, including community centres, medical clinics, retirement homes, and prisons.

=== United States ===
Music therapy has existed in its current form in the [[United States]] since 1944 when the first undergraduate degree program in the world was begun at [[Michigan State University]] and the first graduate degree program was established at the [[University of Kansas]]. The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) was founded in 1998 as a merger between the National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT, founded in 1950) and the American Association for Music Therapy (AAMT, founded in 1971). Numerous other national organizations exist, such as the [[Institute for Music and Neurologic Function]], [[Nordoff-Robbins]] Center For Music Therapy, and the Association for Music and Imagery. Music therapists use ideas from different disciplines such as speech and language, [[physical therapy]], [[medicine]], [[nursing]], and [[education]].

A music therapy degree candidate can earn an undergraduate, master's or doctoral degree in music therapy. Many AMTA approved programs offer equivalency and certificate degrees in music therapy for students that have completed a degree in a related field. Some practicing music therapists have held [[PhD]]s in fields other than, but usually related to, music therapy. Recently, Temple University established a PhD program in music therapy. A music therapist typically incorporates music therapy techniques with broader clinical practices such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation, and other practices depending on client needs. Music therapy services rendered within the context of a social service, educational, or health care agency are often reimbursable by insurance and sources of funding for individuals with certain needs. Music therapy services have been identified as reimbursable under [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], private insurance plans and federal and state government programs.

A degree in music therapy requires proficiency in guitar, piano, voice, music theory, music history, reading music, improvisation, as well as varying levels of skill in assessment, documentation, and other counseling and health care skills depending on the focus of the particular university's program. A music therapist may hold the designations CMT (Certified Music Therapist), ACMT (Advanced Certified Music Therapist), or RMT (Registered Music Therapist) – credentials previously conferred by the former national organizations AAMT and NAMT ; these credentials remain in force through 2020 and have not been available since 1998. The current credential available is MT-BC. To become board certified, a music therapist must complete a music therapy degree from an accredited AMTA program at a college or university, successfully complete a music therapy internship, and pass the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy, administered through The Certification Board for Music Therapists. To maintain the credential, either 100 units of continuing education must be completed every five years, or the board exam must be retaken near the end of the five-year cycle. The units claimed for credit fall under the purview of the Certification Board for Music Therapists.
North Dakota, Nevada and Georgia have established licenses for music therapists. In the State of New York, the License for Creative Arts Therapies (LCAT) incorporates the music therapy credentials within their licensure.

=== Lebanon ===
In 2006, Hamda Farhat introduced music therapy to Lebanon, developing and inventing therapeutic methods such as [[the triple method]] to treat hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, addiction, and post traumatic stress disorder. She has met with great success in working with many international organizations, and in the training of therapists, educators, and doctors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016|reason=This is important information, and I want to keep it for a global perspective.

=== United Kingdom ===
Live music was used in hospitals after both World Wars as part of the treatment program for recovering soldiers. Clinical music therapy in Britain as it is understood today was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by French cellist [[Juliette Alvin]] whose influence on the current generation of British music therapy lecturers remains strong. [[Mary Priestley]], one of Juliette Alvin's students, created "analytical music therapy". The [[Nordoff-Robbins]] approach to music therapy developed from the work of [[Paul Nordoff]] and Clive Robbins in the 1950/60s.

Practitioners are registered with the Health Professions Council and, starting from 2007, new registrants must normally hold a master's degree in music therapy. There are master's level programs in music therapy in [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]], [[Cambridge]], [[University of South Wales|South Wales]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[London]], and there are therapists throughout the UK. The professional body in the UK is the British Association for Music Therapy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bamt.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the World Congress of Music Therapy, coordinated and promoted by the [[World Federation of Music Therapy]], was held in [[Oxford]] on the theme of Dialogue and Debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musictherapyworld.de/modules/wfmt/wfmtoxford2002.htm "Proceedings from the WFMT World Conference in Oxford, UK, 23–28 July 2002"]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues again found that music therapy helped the outcomes of [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Talwar N, Crawford MJ, Maratos A, Nur U, McDermott O, Procter S | title = Music therapy for in-patients with schizophrenia: exploratory randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 189 | issue = 5 | pages = 405–9 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17077429 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.015073 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/189/5/405 | quote = Music therapy may provide a means of improving mental health among people with schizophrenia, but its effects in acute psychoses have not been explored }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/news/p60111_1/ "Music therapy may improve schizophrenia symptoms"], Faculty of Medicine News, Imperial College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of musical therapy in India, can be traced back to ancient Hindu mythology, Vedic texts, and local folk traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Patricia|last2=Cook|first2=Pat|title=Sacred Music Therapy in North India|date=1997|publisher=VWB|isbn=978-3-86135-704-9|pages=61–83|edition=Vol. 39|jstor=41699130}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very possible that music therapy has been used for hundreds of years in the Indian culture.

The "Indian Association of Music Therapy" was established in 2010 by Dr. Dinesh C. Sharma with a motto "to use pleasant sounds in a specific manner like drug in due course of time as green medicine"&lt;ref name="iamt.net.in"&gt;http://www.iamt.net.in/&lt;/ref&gt; He also publish a journal "International Journal of Music Therapy (ISSN 2249-8664) to popularize and promote music therapy research on international platform&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iamt.net.in/iamt/login.php?urlID=IJMT&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aesculapius]] was said to cure diseases of the mind by using song and music, and music therapy was used in Egyptian temples. [[Plato]] said that music affected the emotions and could influence the character of an individual. [[Aristotle]] taught that music affects the soul and described music as a force that purified the emotions. [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] advocated the sound of cymbals and running water for the treatment of mental disorders. Music therapy was practiced in the Bible when David played the harp to rid King Saul of a bad spirit (1 Sam 16:23).&lt;ref name="HowellsOsborn1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howells|first1=John G.|last2=Osborn|first2=M.

Early Modern Medical Explanations for Music’s Effects », in Veit Erlmann (dir.), ''Hearing Cultures. Essays on Sound, Listening and Modernity'', Oxford / New York, Berg Publishers, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote in the 17th century in his classic work, ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10800/10800-8.txt The Anatomy of Melancholy]'', Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3480, "Music a Remedy": "But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise [3481]of divine music, I will confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it hath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against [3482] despair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself. Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, in [3483] Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to know what he could do with his pipe, told him, 'That he would make a melancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.' Ismenias the Theban, [3484] Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now they do those, saith [3485] Bodine, that are troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.mun.ca/munmed/84/crellin.htm "Humanities are the Hormones: A Tarantella Comes to Newfoundland.

The rise of an understanding of the body and mind in terms of the nervous system led to the emergence of a new wave of music therapy in the eighteenth century. Earlier works on the subject, such as [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''Musurgia universalis'' of 1650 and even early eighteenth-century books such as Michael Ernst Ettmüller's 1714 ''Disputatio effectus musicae in hominem'' (Disputation on the Effect of Music on Man) or Friedrich Erhardt Niedten's 1717 ''Veritophili'', still tended to discuss the medical effects of music in terms of bringing the soul and body into harmony. But from the mid-eighteenth century works on the subject such as Richard Brocklesby's 1749 ''Reflections of Antient and Modern Musick'', the 1737 ''Memoires'' of the French Academy of Sciences, or [[Ernst Anton Nicolai]]'s 1745 ''Die Verbindung der Musik mit der Arzneygelahrheit'' (The Connection of Music to Medicine), stressed the power of music over the nerves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hearing Cultures: Essays on Sound, Listening and Modernity|last = Gouk|first = Penelope | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 87–105|editor-last = Erlmann|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1800 books on music therapy often drew on the [[Brunonian system of medicine]], arguing that the stimulation of the nerves caused by music could directly improve health. For example, Peter Lichtenthal's influential 1807 book ''Der musikalische Arzt'' (The Musical Doctor) was also explicitly Brunonian in its treatment of the effects of music on the body. Lichtenthal, a musician, composer and physician with links to the Mozart family, was mostly positive about music, talking of 'doses of music', which should be determined by someone who knows the "Brunonian scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Der musikalische Arzt|last = Lichtenthal|first = Peter|publisher = |year = 1807|isbn = |location = Vienna|page = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music therapy as we know it began in the aftermath of World Wars I and II, when, particularly in the United Kingdom, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers suffering from war-related emotional and physical trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Degmecic | first1 = Dunja | last2 = Požgain | first2 = Ivan | last3 = Filakovic | first3 = Pavo | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2005 | title = Music as Therapy | url = | journal = International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as recent as 2017, music therapy has shown the ability to provide emotional relief to the members of our society. With Logic's "1-800-273-8255", suicide prevention calls experienced a 33% growth in relation to their number of calls received in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/08/25/health/logic-suicide-hotline-vma-18002738255/index.html|title=Calls to suicide prevention hotline spike after VMA performance|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military ==
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]

=== History ===
Music therapy finds its roots in the military. The [[United States Department of War]] issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which described the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;"Technical Bulletin 187: Music in Reconditioning in American Service Forces Convalescent and General Hospitals". ''War Department Technical Bulletin'' (TB Med) 187 (1945): 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following [[World War II]] and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the [[Surgeon General of the United States]]. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal of the study was to understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rorke MA | year = 1996 | title = Music and the Wounded of World War II. | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 189–207 | doi=10.1093/jmt/33.3.189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.

The first university sponsored music therapy course was taught by Margaret Anderton in 1919 at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, E. J.; I. K. Funk; W.S. Woods; A.S. Draper; and W. J. Funk. "Columbia University to Heal Wounded by Music". ''Literary Digest'' (1919): 59–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderton's clinical specialty was working with wounded Canadian soldiers during World War II, using music-based services to aid in their recovery process.

Today, [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] have both presented an array of injuries; however, the two signature injuries are [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) and [[Traumatic Brain Injury]] (TBI). These two signature injuries are increasingly common among millennial military service members and in music therapy programs.

=== Methods ===
Music therapists work with active duty military personnel, veterans, service members in transition, and their families. Music therapists strive to engage clients in music experiences that foster trust and complete participation over the course of their treatment process. Music therapists use an array of music-centered tools, techniques, and activities when working with military-associated clients, many of which are similar to the techniques used in other music therapy settings. These methods include, but are not limited to: group drumming, listening, singing, and songwriting. Songwriting is a particularly effective tool with military veterans struggling with PTSD and TBI as it creates a safe space to, "... work through traumatic experiences, and transform traumatic memories into healthier associations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amir | first1 = Dorit | year = 2004 | title = Giving Trauma a Voice: The Role of Improvisational Music Therapy in Exposing, Dealing with and Healing a Traumatic Experience of Sexual Abuse | url = | journal = Music Therapy Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 96–103 | doi=10.1093/mtp/22.2.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programs ===
Music therapy in the military is seen in programs on military bases, VA healthcare facilities, military treatment facilities, and military communities. Music therapy programs have a large outreach because they exist for all phases of military life: pre-mobilization, deployment, post-deployment, recovery (in the case of injury), and among families of fallen military service personnel.&lt;ref name="AMTA"&gt;[http://www.musictherapy.org/assets/1/7/MusicTherapyMilitaryPops_2014.pdf "Music Therapy and Military Populations"]. American Music Therapy Association, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resounding Joy, Inc., a San Diego, California-based music therapy program, is a pioneer for the use of music therapy in the military. Its Semper Sound program specializes in providing music therapy services to active duty military service members and veterans diagnosed with PTSD, TBI, substance abuse, and other trauma-related diagnoses. It features different programs such as The Semper Sound Band, based in San Diego, California, and the GI Jams Band, based in Chelsea, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resoundingjoyinc.org/semper-sound/ "Resounding Joy Inc."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Reed Army Medical Center located in Bethesda, Maryland, is another pioneer for the use of music therapy in the military. All patients at the medical center are eligible to receive music therapy services; therefore, the range of clients is wide: TBI, stroke, psychological diagnoses (anxiety, depression, PTSD), autism spectrum disorder, and more.&lt;ref name="AMTA" /&gt;

The [[Exceptional Family Member Program]] (EFMP) also exists to provide music therapy services to active duty military families who have a family member with a developmental, physical, emotional, or intellectual disorder. Currently, programs at the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Resounding Joy, Inc., and the [[Music Institute of Chicago]] partner with EFMP services to provide music therapy services to eligible military family members.&lt;ref name="AMTA" /&gt;

'''Risk Everything''' is an advertisement campaign created for American sports apparel company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] by the American advertising agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]]. The advertisement campaign, spanning radio, television, out-of-home, online advertising and print media, was specially made for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and starring well-known [[football players]] from national teams and clubs. This campaign emphasizes the mantra of "risk everything" – taking every dangerous life-or-death chance to succeed and outshine your rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Risk everything! Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and David Luiz take fight to 'unbeatable' clones in animated advert |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/risk-everything-wayne-rooney-cristiano-ronaldo-and-david-luiz-take-fight-to-unbeatable-clones-in-9528849.html |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The campaign, created by ad agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]], emphasizes risk-taking and what it takes to carry on a nation's hopes. The ads show players feeling the heat from intense neck-to-neck competition, fighting for glory and victory who suddenly arrive at a turning point in the football world – or match – and take a risk: giving an amateur the opportunity for a penalty kick or challenging perfect gameplay.

==Television==
Nike released three television advertisements in the Risk Everything series across the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries: Risk Everything, Winner Stays, and The Last Game

===Risk Everything===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Risk Everything-Wayne Rooney.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Wayne Rooney]] in a scene]] --&gt;
Starring Portuguese footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], Brazil's [[Neymar]] and England's [[Wayne Rooney]], the advertisement focuses on the pressure superstar players face when playing for their country in the [[FIFA World Cup]]. Ronaldo is surrounded by his fans – and advertisements depicting him – everywhere and Portugal's hopes seem to be riding on Ronaldo. Rooney, on the other hand, faces skepticism everywhere he goes and Neymar, who is wearing Brazil's prestigious number 10 shirt, is trying to live up to his country's football fanaticism, the legend of the players who wore the number 10 for Brazil and World Cup aspirations. The ad ends the three players walking with their team to the pitch, preparing themselves for the onslaught and the tagline "Pressure shapes Legends".

===Winner Stays===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Winner Stays-Cristiano Ronaldo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15||[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] in the ad]] --&gt;

A group of friends agree to a pick-up football match in a park, with the winning team getting to stay on the field. The players pretend to be (and transform) into players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Wayne Rooney, [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], [[David Luiz]], [[Andrea Pirlo]], [[Thibaut Courtois]], [[Gonzalo Higuaín]], [[Eden Hazard]], [[Gerard Piqué]], [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Mario Götze]], [[Thiago Silva]] and [[Tim Howard]]. The ad features cameos by [[Irina Shayk]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Jon Jones]], [[Anderson Silva]] and the [[Incredible Hulk]]. As the match nears the end with a 2–2 tie and a "next goal wins" scenario, a young boy takes the ball off Ronaldo, and with immense pressure upon him from people across the globe watching the match, scores the penalty and wins the game for his team.

===The Last Game===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Last Game-Players.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Originals overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]]]] --&gt;
An animated feature created in collaboration with [[Passion Pictures]], the ad shows the scientist, promoter of "Perfect Inc.", giving a presentation on how football players are reckless in their game play and "take too many risks". He unveils clones, which are programmed for perfect, no-risk-taken football and focus on efficiency, accuracy and risk mitigation by guaranteed results. The world of football (and sports) suffers from these clones, as they defeat the real players, put them out of business, and drive sports to near-extinction.

Retired Brazilian football legend [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who is saddened by this state of football, watches a young boy practising football tricks all alone and an interview of the scientist, in which he says "Before Perfect Inc. football was a wild and unpredictable affair. I've changed that" which fires him up and embarks on a mission to save football. He rescues the now-forgotten players: Zlatan Ibrahimović, trying to sell copies of his autobiography ''I Am Zlatan Ibrahimović''; Cristiano Ronaldo, who now works as a mannequin in "Sport-U-Gal" sports equipment store; Andrés Iniesta, now a farmer; Neymar and David Luiz, barbers at a beauty salon, trimming the hair of their clones; and Wayne Rooney, a fisherman. Their spirits are raised by Ronaldo, who motivates them by showing them glimpses of their former glory and the death football is facing. There, Neymar takes a selfie on a statue. Rooney questions, "We all want to destroy the clones, but they all are unbeatable!" Ronaldo replies: "Nobody thinks that they can be beatable, but you can do it!" The players challenge the clones to a football match; the team with the first goal wins, and the losers quit football for eternity.

The Players outsmart the clones with their skills despite the Scientist activating a fail-safe which introduces more clones to the field; the match ends with Cristiano Ronaldo effortlessly scoring a goal. As the players [[Goal celebration|celebrate]] and the Scientist sulks, the entire world cheers and human players start returning to sports. A jubilant Ronaldo looks at the players celebrating, and exclaims, "Clone that!"

== Internet ==

=== Ask Zlatan ===
On 9 March 2014, Nike organized a question-and-answer session on [[Twitter]] with then-[[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] striker Zlatan Ibrahimović; Twitter users asked questions to Ibrahimović by tweeting with the [[hashtag]] #DareToZlatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zlatan Ibrahimovic hosts hilarious Twitter Q&amp;A|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/10/zlatan-ibrahimovic-hosts-hilarious-twitter-qa-4513883/|website=Metro.co.uk|publisher=Metro|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rock art]] has been produced in Europe since the Upper Palaeolithic era through to recent centuries. It is found in all of the major regions of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-Palaeolithic period, during later prehistory, regional variants grew up across the continent, being produced by settled, agricultural communities. 

Scholarly interest in European rock art began in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The defining characteristic of rock art is the fact that it is placed on natural rock surfaces; in this way it is distinct from artworks placed on constructed walls or free-standing sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, rock art is a form of landscape art, and includes designs that have been placed on boulder and cliff faces, cave walls and ceilings, and on the ground surface.&lt;ref name="Whitley 3"&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art is a global phenomenon, being found in many different regions of the world.&lt;ref name="Whitley 1"&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various different forms of rock art. This includes ''[[pictographs]]'', which were painted or drawn onto the ''panel'' (rock surface), ''[[petroglyphs]]'', which were carved or engraved onto the panel, and ''[[earth figures]]'' such as earthforms, intaglios and geoglyphs. Some archaeologists also consider pits and grooves in the rock, known as ''cups'', ''rings'' or ''cupules'', as a form of rock art.&lt;ref name="Whitley 3"/&gt;

Although there are some exceptions, the majority of rock art whose creation was ethnographically recorded had been produced during rituals.&lt;ref name="Whitley 3"/&gt; As such, the study of rock art is a component of the archaeology of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic field of [[rock art studies]], a form of [[archaeology]], investigates instances of past rock art to learn about the societies that produced it.

==Upper Palaeolithic rock art==
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

==Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age rock art==
===Atlantic European rock art===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
Various different forms of late prehistoric rock art have been found in [[Atlantic Europe]], the coastal region that extends from the [[Straight of Gibraltar]] up to the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra98|Bradley 1998]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. pp. 493&amp;ndash;494.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art in the British Isles]] comprises primarily of [[cup and ring marks]].

During the Early Bronze Age, which lasted from ''circa'' 2300 through to ''c''.1500 BCE, various depictions of weaponry were engraved onto rock surfaces across Atlantic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra98|Bradley 1998]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern European rock art===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
There are hundres of rock art sites that represent variations of figures, traditions and chronological differences in Northern Europe. Cave paintings, rock paintings and especially open air sites are found on the continent, the british isles and all over the Scandinavian peninsula as well as in Finland and Russia. Perhaps the most famous site is the [[Rock carvings at Alta]] in the north of Norway with the largest collection of hunter gatherer rock art in northern Europe.

===Alpine rock art===
[[File:Scena di caccia al cervo - Seradina R 12 - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Engraved deer-hunting scene at [[Valcamonica]].]]
Rock art engraved on open surfaces, rather than inside shelters or caves, was also produced in the mountainous [[Alps|Alpine region]] during later prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Found predominantly in the southern part of the Alps, in modern-day Italy and France, few examples of rock art have been identified from the northern slopes of the region, in what is now Switzerland and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; Many engravings have been found in the region, along with a few rock paintings (as at Abri Faravel&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal16|Walsh et al. 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and as such, scholars in rock art studies have divided the known collection into between 20 and 30 "regions" of Alpine rock art, the number depending upon how neighbouring occurrences are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; These petroglyphs were usually carved with a fine-line technique which meant that they are only a few millimetres thick, and were typically produced on metamorphic rocks, sandstones and schists which are found sporadically across the Alpine chain, rather than on the more common calcareous rocks from which the mountains are geologically formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like with most rock art across the world, there are no physical-science methods yet available with which to accurately date the Alpine images, and instead archaeologists have relied on a relative chronology by comparing the pictures with artefacts that have been more securely dated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two most prominent concentrations of rock art in the Alps are found at [[Mont Bégo]] in France and the valleys of Valcamonica and Valtellina in Italy, both of which far outnumber other areas for the amount of art that they contain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arc04|Arca 2004]]. p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; At Mount Bego, in southwest France, near the Italian border, over 30,000 illustrated figures have been discovered in the valleys and outliers surrounding the mountain, situated on the high-altitude slopes far above the agricultural land. Archaeologists have dated to the images to the Copper and Bronze Ages, between 2500 and 1700 BCE, because many of the figures are depicted holding daggers and halberds which are stylistically consistent with this period. Similarly, many of the images depict oxen and ploughshares, meaning that they must have been produced following the adoption of agriculture during the Neolithic. It is believed that they all date from the same period, because they are all stylistically consistent and are in a similar state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. pp. 504&amp;ndash;505, 507&amp;ndash;510.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Valcamonica and Valtellina, two lengthy neighbouring valleys in the south-centre of the Alps, archaeologists have estimated the existence of around 300,000 figures, with depictions or humans and other animals, footprints, steep-roofed buildings, wheeled carts, boats and a large number of geometric shapes, lines, spirals and crosses. Although a few of the images found in Valtellina have been tentatively suggested to be post-glacial in date due to the Palaeolithic animal style they depict, the overwhelming majority of artworks are considered to be late prehistoric. Some of the motifs, such as those of humans in an ''orant'' posture with arms upraised in prayer or adoration, have been considered Neolithic, with others being attributed to the Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages, the latter being the most numerous. Some of the illustrations have been dated to the historic period, having been produced by the local [[Camuni]] people who lived within the [[Roman Empire]], and subsequently also from the Medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. pp. 504&amp;ndash;505, 510&amp;ndash;513.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments''' ('''SPACES''' or '''SPACES Archives''') is a non-profit public benefit organization created with an international focus on the study, documentation, and preservation of art environments (or [[visionary environments]]) and self-taught, publicly-accessible artistic activity (see [[self-taught art]]). Currently based in [[Aptos, California]], SPACES boasts an archive of approximately 35,000 photographs as well as hundreds of books, articles, audio and video tapes/DVDs, and artists’ documents. SPACES has become recognized internationally as the largest and most complete archive on this subject.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/about/|title=What is SPACES?|author=TOKY Branding + Design|work=spacesarchives.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/arts/preserving-our-art-spaces.aspx|title=Preserving Our Art Spaces|work=Utne|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050501/news_1a01spaces.html|title=Seymour Rosen, the champion of 'folk art environments' - The San Diego Union-Tribune|work=utsandiego.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPACES maintains an online index of more than 1,400 art environments around the world, exhibiting its collection of images, documents, and writings, and also providing further reading on the artists and their built environments.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design"/&gt; The organization also provides resources and best practices on the preservation of threatened sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/resources/preservation-toolbox/|title=Saving and Preserving Toolbox|author=TOKY Branding + Design|work=spacesarchives.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, SPACES announced a partnership with the [[Kohler Foundation]] to transfer SPACES’ archives and the operation of the website to the only foundation in the country dedicated to the preservation of art environments. The Kohler Foundation, which is the philanthropic organization founded by the [[Kohler family of Wisconsin]], has committed extensive resources to the present and future of SPACES' mission and archives for "generations to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/blog/2017/06/07/spaces-inc-moving-to-wisconsins-kohler-foundation-inc/|title=SPACES, Inc.

== History ==
SPACES was organized in 1969 and then formally Incorporated in 1978 by Founding Director [[Seymour Rosen]], a Los Angeles photographer who became interested in the aesthetic genre of art environments after photographing [[Watts Towers]]. His images of this iconic artwork – including those of the infamous 1959 "stress-test" that proved the Towers’ stability – resulted in Rosen's first major solo photographic exhibition at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1962, titled [http://www.lacma.org/simon-rodia’s-towers-watts-photographic-exhibition-seymour-rosen ''Simon Rodia's Towers in Watts''].&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/about/seymour-rosen/seymour-rosen-bio/|title=Seymour Rosen - Biography|author=TOKY Branding + Design|work=spacesarchives.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacma.org/simon-rodia’s-towers-watts-photographic-exhibition-seymour-rosen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/articles/seymour-rosen-and-spaces|title=Seymour Rosen and SPACES|work=rawvision.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen also authored the 1979 book ''In Celebration of Ourselves''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/about/further-reading|title=Further Reading|work=rawvision.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SeymourRosenandJoFarbHernandez.jpg|thumb|SPACES Founder Seymour Rosen with Jo Farb Hernádez in 1999 at Watts Towers. Photo by Sam Hernádez.]] --&gt;

As the founder of the SPACES organization, Rosen was invited to serve on the board of directors of [[Raw Vision]] with its inception, and from its first issue in 1989 contributed often to its pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/shop/raw-vision-123|title=Raw Vision #1,2,3|work=rawvision.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 he was honored by the Folk Art Society of America with their Award of Distinction for his “pioneering work in the field of environmental documentation and preservation.”.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkart.org/about/awards-of-distinction|title=Awards of Distinction and National Folk Art Sites|work=folkart.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This included advocacy such as successfully designating sites for the California State Landmark registry, including [[Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village]] in Simi Valley and [[Nitt Witt Ridge]] in Cambria.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/25/local/me-rosen25|title=Seymour Rosen, 71; Documented Folk Art Pieces|work=latimes|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/san-luis-obispo/nitt-witt-ridge-arthur-harold-beal.html|title=Nitt Witt Ridge: Cambria's Folk Art Hearst Castle|author=Sarah Linn|work=KCET|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noehill.com/napa/cal0939.asp|title=California Landmark 939: Litto's Hubcap Ranch in Napa County|author=Alvis Hendley|work=noehill.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote 
 | [These sites] defy categorization, and that fact has resulted in an ongoing battle to get institutions to recognize the value of documenting and preserving these forms of expression. Collecting the material has been, of necessity, a labor of love…. But I am told that perhaps the time has come; perhaps a varied and complete record of the most ephemeral events of the American spirit and heritage can finally be assembled for us all to share. Maybe we will even be able to preserve the environments and objects so that people can see them firsthand. SPACES is an attempt to move in that direction, to acknowledge the magic made available to us by those whose work looks best outside of institutional walls—with the hope that we all will take the time to do our own explorations.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design"/&gt;

'''Scythian art''' is art, primarily decorative objects, such as [[jewellery]], produced by the [[nomadic]] tribes in the area known to the ancient Greeks as [[Scythia]], which was centred on the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] and ranged from modern [[Kazakhstan]] to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast of modern [[Poland]] and to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  The identities of the nomadic peoples of the [[steppes]] is often uncertain, and the term "Scythian" should often be taken loosely; the art of nomads much further east than the core Scythian territory exhibits close similarities as well as differences, and terms such as the "Scytho-Siberian world" are often used.  Other [[Eurasian nomad]] peoples recognised by ancient writers, notably [[Herodotus]], include the [[Massagetae]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Saka]], the last a name from Persian sources, while ancient Chinese sources speak of the [[Xiongnu]] or Hsiung-nu.  Modern archaeologists recognise, among others, the [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], [[Tagar culture|Tagar]], and [[Aldy-Bel culture]]s, with the furthest east of all, the later [[Ordos culture]] a little west of [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 2-3, 22-23; Bunker, 3-4, 23; for more peoples in Herodotus see [[Eurasian nomads#Chronological division|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of these peoples is collectively known as '''steppes art'''.

In the case of the [[Scythians]] the characteristic art was produced in a period from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC, after which the Scythians were gradually displaced from most of their territory by the Sarmatians, and rich grave deposits cease among the remaining Scythian populations on the [[Black Sea]] coast. Over this period many Scythians became sedentary, and involved in trade with neighbouring peoples such as the Greeks.

In the earlier period Scythian art included very vigorously modelled stylised [[animal style|animal figures]], shown singly or in combat, that had a long-lasting and very wide influence on other [[Eurasia]]n cultures as far apart as [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Celtic art|the European Celts]].  As the Scythians came in contact with the [[Greece|Greeks]] at the Western end of their area, their artwork influenced Greek art, and was influenced by it; also many pieces were made by Greek craftsmen for Scythian customers. Although we know that goldsmith work was an important area of [[Ancient Greek art]], very little has survived from the core of the Greek world, and finds from Scythian burials represent the largest group of pieces we now have.  The mixture of the two cultures in terms of the background of the artists, the origin of the forms and styles, and the possible history of the objects, gives rise to complex questions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 1, 4-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Many art historians feel that the Greek and Scythian styles were too far apart for works in a hybrid style to be as successful as those firmly in one style or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 355&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences from urbanized civilizations such as those of Persia and China, and the mountain cultures of the [[Caucasus]], also affected the art of their nomadic neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Scythian art especially Scythian [[gold]] jewellery is highly valued by museums and many of the most valuable artefacts are in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]. Their Eastern neighbours, the [[Pazyryk culture]] in [[Siberia]] produced similar art, although they related to the Chinese in a way comparable to that of the Scythians with the Greek and Iranian cultures. In recent years, [[archeologist]]s have made valuable finds in various places within the area.

==Types of objects==
[[File:Фрагменты Пекторали.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Gold Scythian pectoral, or neckpiece, from a royal [[kurgan]] in [[Tolstaya Mogila]], [[Pokrov, Ukraine]], dated to the second half of the 4th century BC. ]]

The Scythians worked in a wide variety of materials such as gold, [[wood]], [[leather]], [[bone]], [[bronze]], [[iron]], [[silver]] and [[electrum]].  Clothes and horse-trappings were sewn with small plaques in metal and other materials, and larger ones, including some of the most famous, probably decorated shields or wagons.  Wool [[felt]] was used for highly decorated clothes, tents and horse-trappings, and an important nomad mounted on his horse in his best outfit must have presented a very colourful and exotic sight.  As nomads, the Scythians produced entirely portable objects, to decorate their horses, clothes, tents and wagons, with the exception in some areas of [[kurgan stelae]], stone [[stelae]] carved somewhat crudely to depict a human figure, which were probably intended as memorials. Bronze-casting of very high quality is the main metal technique used across the Eurasian steppe, but the Scythians are distinguished by their frequent use of gold at many sites,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 1&lt;/ref&gt; though large hoards of gold objects have also been found further east, as in the hoard of over 20,000 pieces of "Bactrian Gold" in partly nomadic styles from [[Tillya Tepe]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Earlier pieces reflected [[animal style]] traditions; in the later period many pieces, especially in metal, were produced by Greek craftsmen who had adapted Greek styles to the tastes and subject-matter of the wealthy Scythian market, and probably often worked in Scythian territory. Other pieces are thought to be imports from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 4-10&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Scythians prospered through trade with the Greeks, they settled down and started farming. They also established permanent settlements such as a site in [[Belsk]], [[Ukraine]] believed to the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]] with craft workshops and Greek [[pottery]] prominent in the ruins. The [[Pazyryk burials]] (east of Scythia proper) are especially important because the frozen conditions have preserved a wide variety of objects in perishable materials that have not survived in most ancient burials, on the steppes or elsewhere.  These include wood carvings, textiles including clothes and [[felt]] appliqué wall hangings, and even elaborate [[tattoo]]s on the body of the so-called [[Siberian Ice Maiden]]. These make it clear that important ancient nomads and their horses, tents, and wagons were very elaborately fitted out in a variety of materials, many brightly coloured.   Their [[iconography]] includes animals, monsters and anthropomorphic beasts, and probably some deities including a "[[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]]", as well as energetic geometric motifs.  Archaeologists have uncovered felt rugs as well as well-crafted tools and domestic utensils. Clothing uncovered by archaeologists has also been well made many trimmed by embroidery and appliqué designs. Wealthy people wore clothes covered by gold embossed plaques, but small gold pieces are often found in what seem to be relatively ordinary burials.  Imported goods include a famous carpet, the oldest to survive, that was probably made in or around Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Steppes jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The "looped" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the [[reindeer]], which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period.  The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing.  The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan [[totem]]. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:
*the burial site of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]] in the [[Kuban]] dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage)
*[[Tápiószentmárton]] in [[Hungary]] dating from the 5th century BC, now [[National Museum of Hungary]], [[Budapest]]
*[[Kul Oba]] in the [[Crimea]] dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Loehr|Loehr, Max]], "The Stag Image in Scythia and the Far East", ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', Vol. 9, (1955), pp. 63-76, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20066973 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic form is the [[openwork]] plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, Ann, "Interpreting Scythian Art: East vs. West",
''Artibus Asiae'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1977), pp. 124-138, [[DOI 10.2307/3250196]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250196 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts &amp; personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins &amp; belts, helped to act as armour.

The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess &amp; powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.

The primary weapon of this horse riding culture was the bow, &amp; a special case had been developed to carry the delicate but very powerful composite bow. This case, "the gorytus", had a separate container on the outside which acted as a quiver, &amp; the whole was often decorated with animal scenes or scenes depicting daily life on the steppes. There was a marked following of Grecian elements after the 4th century BC, when Greek craftsmen were commissioned to decorate many of the daily use articles.

Scythian art has become well known in the West thanks to a series of touring loan exhibitions from Ukrainian and Russian museums, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.

==Archaeology==
[[File:HorseAttackedByTigerOrdos4th-1stBCE.JPG|thumb|left|Bronze [[Ordos culture]] plaque, 4th century BC; a horse attacked by a tiger]]
Kurgans are large mounds that are obvious in the landscape and a high proportion have been plundered at various times; many may never have had a permanent population nearby to guard them.  To counter this, treasures were sometimes deposited in secret chambers below the floor and elsewhere, which have sometimes avoided detection until the arrival of modern archaeologists, and many of the most outstanding finds come from such chambers in kurgans that had already been partly robbed.

Elsewhere the [[desertification]] of the steppe has brought once-buried small objects to lie on the surface of the eroded land, and many [[Ordos bronzes]] seem to have been found in this way.

Russian explorers first brought Scythian artworks recovered from Scythian burial mounds to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the early 18th century. These works formed the basis of the collection held by the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. [[Catherine the Great]] was so impressed from the material recovered from the [[kurgans]] or burial mounds that she ordered a systematic study be made of the works. However, this was well before the development of modern archaeological techniques.

[[Nikolai Veselovsky]] (1848-1918) was a [[Russian archaeologist]] specializing in Central Asia who led many of the most important excavations of kurgans in his day.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first sites discovered by modern archaeologists were the kurgans [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], Ulagan district of the [[Altay Republic]], south of [[Novosibirsk]]. The name [[Pazyryk culture]] was attached to the finds, five large burial mounds and several smaller ones between 1925 and 1949 opened in 1947 by a Russian archeologist, [[Sergei Rudenko]]; Pazyryk is in the [[Altay Mountains]] of southern Siberia. The kurgans contained items for use in the afterlife. The famous Pazyryk carpet discovered is the oldest surviving wool pile oriental rug.
[[File:TilliaTepeCrown2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Golden crown. Treasure of [[Tillia tepe]], [[Afghanistan]].]]

The enormous hoard of "Bactrian gold" discovered at [[Tillya Tepe]] in northern [[Afghanistan]] in 1978 comes from the fringes of the nomadic world, and the objects reflect the influence of many cultures to the south of the steppes as well as steppes art.  The six burials come from the early 1st century AD (a coin of [[Tiberius]] is among the finds) and though their cultural context is unfamiliar, it may relate to the [[Indo-Scythians]] who had created an empire in north India.

Recent digs in [[Belsk]], Ukraine uncovered a vast city believed to be the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]] described by [[Herodotus]]. Numerous craft workshops and works of pottery have been found. A kurgan or burial mound near the village of [[Ryzhanovka]] in Ukraine, {{convert|75|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Kiev]], found in the 1990s has revealed one of the few unlooted tombs of a Scythian chieftain, who was ruling in the forest-steppe area of the western fringe of Scythian lands. There at a late date in Scythian culture (c. 250 - 225 BC), a recently nomadic aristocratic class was gradually adopting the agricultural life-style of their subjects. Many items of jewellery were also found in the kurgan.

A discovery made by Russian and German archaeologists in 2001 near [[Kyzyl]], the capital of the Russian republic of [[Tuva]] in Siberia is the earliest of its kind and predates the influence of Greek civilisation. Archaeologists discovered almost 5,000 decorative gold pieces including earrings, pendants and beads. The pieces contain representations of many local animals from the period including panthers, lions, bears and deer.

Earlier rich kurgan burials always include a male, with or without a female consort, but from the 4th and 3rd centuries there are number of important burials with only a female.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
[[Image:Scythian resurrection.jpg|thumb|350px|Golden plaques representing the resurrection of a dead hero (Saka culture, 5th century BC, [[Hermitage Museum]]).]]

The finds from the most important nomad burials remain in the countries where they were found, or at least the capitals of the states in which they were located when found, so that many finds from Ukraine and other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] are in Russia.  Western European and American museums have relatively small collections, though there have been exhibitions touring internationally. The Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has the longest standing and the best collection of Scythian art.  Other museums including several local ones in Russia, in [[Budapest]] and [[Miskolc]] in Hungary, [[Kiev]] in Ukraine, the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] and elsewhere have important holdings. The ''Scythian Gold'' exhibition came from a number of Ukrainian exhibitions including the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, the Institute of Archaeology in Kiev and the State Historical Archaeological Preserve at [[Pereiaslav-Khmel'nyts'kyi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">'''Separated at birth''', usually phrased as a question, is a light-hearted media device for pointing out people who are unrelated but bear a notable facial resemblance, implying that they are twins who were separated soon after being born and presumably adopted by separate families.

The title "Separated at Birth?" was a trademark of Spy Publishing Partners, the publishers of the now defunct [[Spy (magazine)|''Spy'']] magazine, a monthly publication that published satire, humor, and investigative journalism from 1986 to 1998. The magazine would pair two carefully selected photos of two unrelated famous persons and the juxtaposition would highlight their physical similarities to humorous effect.

There were several ''Separated at Birth?'' books issued around the same time, with whimsical comparisons such as [[Mick Jagger]] vs. [[Don Knotts]] as the fictional film character ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
Originally conceived as a training program for connoisseurship by [[Sotheby's]] auction house in 1969, Sotheby's Institute of Art aims to provide students with education on the business of art while exploring both the scholarly and practical sides of the art world.

In 1995, Sotheby's Institute of Art – London was granted the status of an Affiliated Institution of the [[University of Manchester]]'s Department of Art History and Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/degrees-on-offer-at-sothebys/96082.article|title="Degrees on Offer at Sotheby's", Times Higher Education, 13/11/1995|work="Degrees on Offer at Sotheby's", Times Higher Education, 13/11/1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2002, Sotheby's sold its Institute to a US-based information and educational services firm, [[Cambridge Information Group]] (CIG), which retains the Sotheby's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cig.com/portfolio/education/sothebys-institute-of-art/|title=Cambridge Information Group|work=Cambridge Information Group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215145/http://www.cig.com/portfolio/education/sothebys-institute-of-art/|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotheby's Institute continues to have strong links with Sotheby's auction house, having members on the Sotheby's Institute of Art - London advisory board &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/About/Academic-Leadership/Tom_Christopherson_joins_Sothebys_Institute.aspx|title=Sotheby's Institute Academic Leadership News|work=Sotheby's Institute Academic Leadership News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202154808/http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/About/Academic-Leadership/Tom_Christopherson_joins_Sothebys_Institute.aspx|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and students having access to internships, auctions and exhibitions at [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/Programmes/PLondon/PLMasterDegree/PLMArtBusiness/MAAB-Visits.aspx|title=Sotheby's Trainee Auctioneer Day|work=Sotheby's Trainee Auctioneer Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the Institute broadened its course offerings in New York and in 2010 the New York Institute received degree-granting authority from the Regents of the State of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/|title=Regents of the State of New York|work=Regents of the State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been an accredited member of the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] since 1989. In 2013 Sotheby's Institute announced a partnership with the [[Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management]] at [[Claremont Graduate University]], establishing a new master's degree in Art Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4546.asp?item=6876|title=Claremont Graduate University Office of Communications|work=Claremont Graduate University Office of Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan T.D.

==Library==
The libraries on the London, New York and Los Angeles campuses collectively contain
more than 3 million volumes, 350 databases, 70 print subscriptions, and 126 serials—all of which are academic in nature and related to art and the art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sothebysinstitute.com/news-and-events/news/spotlight-on-libraries/|title=Spotlight on Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Sotheby's auction house==
Sotheby's Institute of Art was founded by [[Sotheby's]] auction house in London in 1969. Initially, the Institute served as a training program for auction house employees and provided lessons in connoisseurship. Auction house experts and professionals often serve as Sotheby's Institute of Art faculty and guest speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sothebysinstitute.com/why-sothebys/our-faculty-and-guest-speakers/|title=Our Faculty {{!}} Sotheby's Institute of Art|website=www.sothebysinstitute.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kiddell Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sothebysinstitute.com/news-and-events/news/the-kiddell-collection/|title=The Misunderstood Objects of The Kiddell Collection|website=www.sothebysinstitute.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as "The Black Museum") is an accumulation of fakes, forgeries, and reproductions, built up over a number of decades by Sotheby’s Auction House former Director, Jim Kiddell. It is now on permanent loan to Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London. Originally formed as a pedagogical handling tool for auction house specialists, the Collection today continues to support student enquiry. The Kiddell Collection is emblematic for the kind of in-situ access students have during their studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">The '''First Symphony''' of the [[Germany|German]] composer [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]] was completed in 1955.

Subtitled ''Versuch eines Requiems'' (''Essay Towards a Requiem''), the piece began life in 1936 as a [[cantata]] for [[alto]] solo and orchestra, setting translations of poetry by [[Walt Whitman]]. Hartmann appended the title ''Unser Leben: Symphonisches Fragment'' (''Our Life: Symphonic Fragment'') in 1938, intending the piece as a comment on conditions under the [[Nazi]] regime. Unsurprisingly it went unperformed during these years, as did the majority of Hartmann's output, and it was not until 1948 that the piece was performed in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaschinski, Andreas (1999) Liner notes for Hartmann Complete Symphonies, EMI 5 56911 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartmann revisited the piece in the early 1950s. At this point, his designated First Symphony had been ''[[Miserae]]''. However Hartmann withdrew that work, and in 1954-55 after further revision, re-designated this piece as his First Symphony, with its new title ''Versuch eines Requiem''.&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, Guy (1995) ''Hindemith, Hartmann and Henze'', Phaidon&lt;/ref&gt; It was first performed in its final version in [[Vienna]] on 22 June 1957 by the [[Vienna Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Nino Sanzogno]] with soloist [[Hilde Rössel-Majdan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schott-music.com/shop/1/show,34864.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is his only numbered symphony to include a vocal part.

==Settings==
Hartmann did not set complete poems by Whitman, instead opting for extracts. The third movement is purely orchestral.
#Introduktion: Elend (''Introduction: Misery'') Text from ''I Sit and Look Out''&lt;br&gt;
#Frühling (''Spring'') Text from ''[[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd]]''&lt;br&gt;
#Thema mit vier Variationen (''Theme with four variations'')&lt;br&gt;
#Tränen (''Tears'') Text from ''Tears''&lt;br&gt;
#Epilog: Bitte (''Epilogue: Supplication'') Text from ''Pensive on her Dead Gazing''

'''Textbookrental.ca''' is a textbook rental service company, based in Canada. Its services include textbook rentals,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tai, [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/andrew-tai-/avoid-ripoffs_b_6646846.html "How to Stop Big Companies from Ripping You Off"].

''Actualitté.com'' September 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; used textbook sales, a buyback program, and instore kiosks in university bookstores.

==History==
[[File:Kiosk stand of textbookrental.ca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Textbookrental.ca in store Kiosk]]

Textbookrental.ca was established in 2010 by entrepreneurs Gershon Hurwitz and Mike Stock,&lt;ref name="Maclean's2010"/&gt;  in response to student concerns about the rising cost of textbooks.&lt;ref name="Moneyville"/&gt;  By 2011, the online store was selling textbooks at a discount and renting texts, allowing searching by textbook [[ISBN]], author, and title, selecting a 2, 3, or 6 month (semester) rental period, and shipping options. Once the semester is over, books are returned with a free return shipping label,&lt;ref name="CTV2011"/&gt; or in person at 11 depots.&lt;ref name="Sil2012"/&gt;&lt;!-- quotes should be in quotes, otherwise paraphrase --&gt;

The company also set up a service to buy back used books,&lt;ref name="Sil2012"/&gt; either by paying cash for books dropped off at a depot location near campus, by providing a free shipping label from the website to ship the books to the company.&lt;ref name="Globe2011"/&gt;

In 2013, Textbookrental.ca raised $415,000 of seed funding, mainly from Seek Capital, to expand its business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockhouse.com/news/business-news/2013/07/29/textbookrental-ca-snares-$415k-seed-cash,-just-in  "TextbookRental.ca snares $415k seed cash, just in time for school"]. ''Stockhouse Editorial''. July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In  2014 it continues to be privately owned and is managed by the founders together with an executive team.

'''''The Bad Child's Book of Beasts''''' is an 1896 [[Children's literature|children's book]] written by [[Hilaire Belloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Charles D.|title=The Seuss, the whole Seuss, and nothing but the Seuss: a visual biography of Theodor Seuss Geisel|year=2004|publisher=Random House, Inc|isbn=0-375-82248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=December 9, 1897|volume=65|title=The Nation Company|oclc=1643268|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce |first=Joseph|title=Old Thunder: A Life of Hilaire Belloc|year=2002|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=0-89870-942-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrated by [[Basil Temple Blackwood]], the superficially naive verses give tongue-in-cheek advice to children. In the book, the animals tend to be sage-like, and the humans dull and self-satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nation]]'', p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first three months of its publication, ''The Bad Child's Book of Beasts'' sold 4,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Alfred Douglas]] accused Belloc of plagiarizing his work ''Tales with a Twist'', which, although published two years after ''The Bad Child's Book of Beasts'', was, according to Douglas, written before Belloc's work.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustrations have also drawn comparison to the works seen in [[Dr. Seuss]] books.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Brus''''', also known as '''''The Bruce''''', is a long narrative poem, in [[Early Scots]], of just under 14,000 [[octosyllabic]] lines composed by [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]] which gives a historic and [[chivalry|chivalric]] account of the actions of [[Robert the Bruce]] and the [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Black Douglas]] in the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]] during a period from the circumstances leading up the English invasion of 1296 through to Scotland's restored position in the years between the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton|Truce of 1328]] and the death of [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray]] in 1332.

The poem's centre-piece (literally) is an extensive account of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] of 1314. Barbour's poetic account of these events is a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] in Scotland's [[National myth#Scotland|national story]]. The description of the battle is Barbour’s masterpiece.&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;

The poem was written about 1375, "...to throw behind the new king, Robert II (who gave Barbour a pension) the weight of his grandfather's (Bruce's) achievements and reputation."&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/STELLA/STARN/poetry/BRUS/intro.htm Duncan, A., "Fredome is a noble thing", Barbour, John. ''The Brus'']&lt;/ref&gt; Barbour's work is a romance based upon a lost life of Douglas and a chronicle or chronicles which told of King Robert and his times. At the beginning of the poem, he conflates three Bruces into the single person of the hero, probably by design. [[Archie Duncan (historian)|Archie Duncan]] notes Barbour's fondness for exaggerated numbers for the size of any army.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Here and there the order of events is transposed. Despite this, it has been regarded from his own time as, in all details, a trustworthy source for the history of the period.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/212/0502.html "John Barbour:''The Bruce'', ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'', 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the piece, Bruce overshadows all his associates. In book nine, in recounting Edward Bruce's victories in Galloway, Barbour does not relate the whole story, but sums up his worthiness by remarking that "he might have rivaled any of his contemporaries ''excepting only his brother''".&lt;ref name=Macmillan/&gt;  The king is a hero of the chivalric type common in contemporary romance; [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] is a "noble thing" to be sought and won at all costs; the opponents of such freedom are shown in the dark colours which history and poetic propriety require; but there is none of the complacency of the merely provincial habit of mind. The lines do not lack vigour; and there are passages of high merit, notably the oft-quoted section beginning ''"A! fredome is a noble thing"''.

Despite a number of errors of fact, the account has a greater degree of historical veracity than is usually associated with the verse-chronicle genre (for instance, [[Blind Harry]]'s [[The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace|Wallace]] composed in the following century). But it is much more than a rhyming chronicle; it contains many fine descriptive passages, and sings the praises of freedom. Its style is somewhat bald and severe.  No one has doubted Barbour's authorship of the Brus, but argument has been attempted to show that the text as we have it is an edited copy, perhaps by John Ramsay, a [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] [[scribe]], who wrote out the two extant texts, one preserved in the [[Advocates Library, Edinburgh]], and the other in the library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]].

==Influence==
Barbour's influence on later Scottish writers can be seen in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''Lord of the Isles'' and ''Castle Dangerous''.&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bruceofbannockbu00barbrich#page/n9/mode/2up MacMillan, Michael.

The book, co-written by [[Ed Martin (Missouri politician)|Ed Martin]] and [[Brett M. Decker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/politics/phyllis-schlafly-donald-trump-book/index.html|title=When Phyllis Schlafly made the case for Donald Trump|first=Eugene|last=Scott|work=cnn.com|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   describes Trump's anti-establishment stances on the following issues:

* [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic regulations]]
* [[education]]
* [[family values]]
* [[illegal immigration]]
* [[judicial activism]]
* [[political correctness]]
* [[social security]]
* the [[U.S. military]]
* [[trade]]

One argument the book makes is that Republicans who do not support Trump would wind up helping to elect Hillary Clinton instead of him.&lt;ref name="Amazon reviewers"&gt;"This book by Phyllis Schlafly, Ed Martin, and Brett Decker shows why Republicans not supporting Trump are helping elect Hillary Clinton." —[[Laura Ingraham]]&lt;/ref&gt; It also argues that Republicans and independents ought to "unify behind his candidacy".&lt;ref follow="Amazon reviewers"&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In The Conservative Case for Trump, Phyllis Schlafly, Ed Martin, and Brett M. Decker show how President Trump can get our country back on the right track, and why Republicans and independents need to unify behind his candidacy."—Newt Gingrich&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[William F. Buckley Jr.#Buckley Rule|Buckley Rule]].)

The book's publication followed Schlafly's tussle with the board of the [[Eagle Forum]] after she unilaterally endorsed Trump's presidency.&lt;ref name="Thorner" /&gt;

'''''The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily''''' (German title: ''Märchen'' or ''Das Märchen'') is a [[fairy tale]] by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] published in [[1795 in literature|1795]] in [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s German magazine ''[[Die Horen (Schiller)|Die Horen]]'' (The [[Horae]]). It concludes Goethe's novella rondo ''[[Conversations of German Emigrants]]'' (1795). ''Das Märchen'' is regarded as the founding example of the genre of [[:de:Kunstmärchen|Kunstmärchen]], or artistic fairy tale.&lt;ref&gt;''The Literature of German Romanticism'' (ed. Dennis F. Mahoney). Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2004. {{ISBN|9781571132369}}. Page 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
The story revolves around the crossing and bridging of a river, which represents the divide between the outer life of the senses and the ideal aspirations of the human being.

==Synopsis==

The tale begins with two [[will-o'-the-wisp]]s who wake a ferryman and ask to be taken across a river. The ferryman does so, and for payment, they shake gold from themselves into the boat. This alarms the ferryman, for if the gold had gone into the river, it would overflow. He demands as payment: three artichokes, three cabbages, and three onions, and the will-o'-the-wisps may depart only after promising to bring him such. The ferryman takes the gold up to a high place, and deposits it into a rocky cleft, where it is discovered by a green snake who eats the gold, and finds itself luminous. This gives the snake opportunity to study an underground temple where we meet an old man with a lamp which can only give light when another light is present. The snake now investigates the temple, and finds four kings: one gold, one silver, one bronze, and one a mixture of all three.

The story then switches over to the wife of the old man, who meets a melancholy prince. He has met a beautiful Lily, but is distressed by the fact that anyone who touches her will die. The snake is able to form a temporary bridge across the river at midday, and in this way, the wife and prince come to the beautiful Lily's garden, where she is mourning her fate. As twilight falls, the prince succumbs to his desire for the Beautiful Lily, rushes towards her, and dies. The green snake encircles the prince, and the old man, his wife, and the will-o'-the-wisps form a procession and cross the river on the back of the snake.

Back in the land of the senses, and guided by the old man, the Lily is able to bring the prince back to life&amp;nbsp;— albeit in a dream state&amp;nbsp;— by touching both the snake and the prince. The snake then sacrifices itself, and changes into a pile of precious stones which are thrown into the river. The old man then directs them towards the doors of the temple which are locked. The will-o'-the-wisps help them enter by eating the gold out of the doors. At this point, the temple is magically transported beneath the river, surfacing beneath the ferryman's hut&amp;nbsp;— which turns into a silver altar. The three kings bestow gifts upon the sleeping prince and restore him. The fourth, mixed king collapses as the will-o'-the-wisps lick the veins of gold out of him. We also find that Lily's touch no longer brings death. Thus, the prince is united with the beautiful Lily, and they are married. When they look out from the temple, they see a permanent bridge which spans the river&amp;nbsp;— the result of the snake's sacrifice&amp;nbsp;— "and to the present hour the Bridge is swarming with travellers, and the Temple is the most frequented on the whole Earth".

==Analysis==
It has been claimed that ''Das Märchen'' was born out of Goethe's reading of The ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]'' and that it is full of esoteric symbolism. In 1786, Goethe observed that ''The Chymical Wedding'' contains “a pretty fairy story” for which he had no time at the moment.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Bruford. ''Culture and Society in Classical Weimar 1775-1806''. Cambridge University Press, 1975. Page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Steiner]], in his 1918 book ''Goethe's Standard of the Soul'', speaks of it as follows: “On the river stands the Temple in which the marriage of the Young Man with the Lily takes place. The ‘marriage’ with the supersensible, the realisation of the free personality, is possible in a human soul whose forces have been brought into a state of regularity that in comparison with the usual state is a transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA022/English/APC1925/GA022_c03.html|title=Goethe's Standard of the Soul|chapter=III. As illustrated in his fairy story of 'The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily'|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|authorlink=Rudolf Steiner|year=1925|translator=D. S. Osmond}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article lead to an [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|invitation to speak]] to the German [[Theosophical Society]] which eventually lead to Steiner becoming its General Secretary.

Tom Raines gives the following historical background for “The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily”:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Fairy Tale was written by Goethe as a response to a work of Schiller’s entitled ''Über die aesthetische Erziehung des Menschen'' (Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man). One of the main thoughts considered in these ‘letters’ centred around the question of human freedom… Schiller saw that a harmonious social life could only be founded on the basis of free human personalities. He saw that there was an "ideal human being" within everyone and the challenge was to bring the outer life experiences into harmony with this "ideal". Then the human being would lead a truly worthy existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schiller was trying to build an inner bridge between the Person in the immediate reality and the 'ideal human being'. He wrote these ‘Letters’ during the time and context of the [[French Revolution]]. This revolution was driven by a desire for outer social changes to enable human personalities to become free. But both Schiller and Goethe recognised that freedom cannot be ‘imposed’ from the outside but must arise from within each person. Whilst he had an artistic nature, Schiller was more at home in the realm of philosophic thoughts and although Goethe found much pleasure in these ‘Letters’ of Schiller, he felt that the approach concerning the forces in the soul was too simply stated and, it should be said, working in abstract ideas was not Goethe's way. So he set about writing a Fairy Tale that would show, in imaginative pictures, the way in which a human soul could become whole and free, thereby giving rise to a new and free human community. And this was published in ''Die Horen'' in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newview.org.uk/green_snake.htm "Goethe's 'Fairy Tale'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929202046/http://www.newview.org.uk/green_snake.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} in ''New View'' magazine, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Adaptations==
The tale was the basis for [[Giselher Klebe]]'s 1969 [[opera]] ''[[Das Märchen von der schönen Lilie]]''.

'''The Miracle Project''' is a theater and film program for [[autism|autistic children]] and their siblings and friends, which was featured in the [[HBO]] [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Autism: The Musical''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alumnicruises.org/Autism/Autism%202011%20Jun/ajun11_MP.htm |title=The Miracle Project on the Seas |publisher=Alumnicruises.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autismone1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hector Gonzalez |url=http://old.autismone.org/?goto=chicago&amp;page=miracleProject |title=Autism One 2009 :: The Miracle Project |publisher=Old.autismone.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], and won two [[Emmy awards]] and many Audience Awards.&lt;ref name="autismone1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperCollins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollinsspeakersbureau.com/speaker/elaine-hall.aspx |title=Elaine Hall, HarperCollins Speaker |publisher=Harper Collins Speakers Bureau |date= |accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program was founded by Elaine Hall.&lt;ref name="autismone1"/&gt; Elaine also coaches children seeking show business careers, as well as autistic and neurotypical children with relationship, self-esteem and self-confidence issues.&lt;ref name="autismone1"/&gt; Elaine's adopted son Neal has autism, and she has published a book ''Now I See the Moon'' about her life as his mother.&lt;ref name="HarperCollins"/&gt; Elaine and Diane have also produced a [[DVD]] series entitled ''7 Keys to Unlocking the World of Autism''.&lt;ref name="HarperCollins"/&gt; Elaine has been featured in ''The Autism Perspective'' magazine, and has received the Angel Award from the Malibu Special Education Foundation, the Kinus Award for Outstanding Achievement (in Canada) and the Miracle Worker Award from [[Autism Speaks]].&lt;ref name="HarperCollins"/&gt;

==Recordings==
The Miracle Project also produced a CD entitled ''Fly...Into the World of Autism'', featuring music written by children in the project and performed by [[Jack Black]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Stephen Stills]], and other celebrities.&lt;ref name="HarperCollins"/&gt;

==The Miracle Project at Sea==
The Miracle Project linked up with Autism on the Seas who assists families cruising with individuals with special needs.  Together the Miracle Project worked side by side with this group of individuals to put together a performance (comedy/music) to be performed in front of an audience on board Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas.  Practices were held daily where the individuals learned songs, parts, created instruments, and interacted with one another to put together a performance of their lifetime!  With the help of some great staff and amazing individuals the show was a success!

'''''The Patriot''''' is a 1998 American [[action film|action]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] loosely based on the novel ''[[The Last Canadian]]'' by [[William C. Heine]]. The film stars [[Steven Seagal]] and is directed by [[Dean Semler]]. The plot involves an American patriot who has to foil the plot of a [[militia]] to release a deadly [[virus]]. It is Seagal's first [[direct-to-video]] film.

==Plot==
Near the town of [[Ennis, Montana|Ennis]], [[Montana]], local doctor and former government research immunologist Wesley McClaren ([[Steven Seagal]]) who has an interest in [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] and is also a weapons and self-defense expert, is called to a hospital when people start dying from an unknown but very deadly disease. He determines that the cause is a highly dangerous airborne [[virus]] and calls in a Biological Response team, who seal off the town while doctors start treating sufferers with a vaccine. Unfortunately for them, several have already died.

The source of the virus is traced to a local self-styled [[Rebellion|rebel]] [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] leader, Floyd Chisholm ([[Gailard Sartain]]), who has given himself up after a long siege and has been arrested on weapons charges. In court, having ingested the virus himself (believing that he also possesses the vaccine) he spits at the judge, and starts the rapid spread of the disease.

Floyd's [[militia]] followers, who have been allowed to go free, attack the prison and rescue Floyd. They then proceed to invade and besiege the hospital, with much loss of life, and take medical personnel hostage including Wesley and his daughter Holly ([[Camilla Belle]]). But too late, they realize that the vaccine they were seeking at the hospital is the same as the one they possess which only delays the effect of the deadly virus.
Working at gunpoint, Wesley takes a sample of Holly's blood; it shows that Holly has been infected, but somehow her body is fighting it off. Wesley and Holly contrive to escape and travel to a farm where Holly's grandfather lives. Wesley takes a blood sample from his friend Dr. Ann White Cloud (Whitney Yellow Robe), and realizes that her body is also fighting off the infection.

Wesley and Ann gain access to a secret underground laboratory where Wesley used to work, where they hope to come up with a cure. Wesley finds out why Ann and Holly are not being affected by the virus: they have been drinking tea made with a specific wild herb that is known to Native American healers.

Back at the hospital, Wesley and Holly are captured by the militia, but he manages to kill Floyd and disable the other soldiers. As soon as the biological protection team learn of the cure, they go out and pick all the flowers they can find and drop them by helicopter over the town, telling the people to boil them and drink the liquid.

==Production==
The film, directed by [[63rd Academy Awards|academy-award-winning]] [[cinematographer]] [[Dean Semler]], was reportedly originally intended as a theatrical release, but was ultimately released [[direct-to-video]], the first Seagal film to skip theaters entirely.&lt;ref name="Vern"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vern |date= March 2012 |title= Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal |location=London |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |isbn=978-0857687227 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shot over eight weeks in [[Ennis, Montana|Ennis]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]], [[Montana]], and for three days on the campus of [[Montana State University]]. Filming was briefly halted to remove snow from the ground during shooting in Virginia City, to maintain continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haines |first= Joan |date= November 11, 1997 |title= Seagal wraps up filming of 'The Patriot' |url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/article_316f073d-6fe2-5f97-9264-3920412e23f5.html |newspaper=Bozeman Daily Chronicle |location=Bozeman, MT |accessdate= October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[screenplay]] is credited to M. Sussman and John Kingswell, assumed to be [[pseudonyms]] due to the complete lack of information on either writer (neither has any other film credit of any kind). Several writers, including [[David Ayer]] and Paul Mones&lt;ref name="Vern"/&gt; were rumored to be working on the script prior to its release; Mones was ultimately credited as a producer. Though the movie is credited as an adaptation of [[William C. Heine|William C. Heine's]] novel ''[[The Last Canadian]]'', it shares virtually no similarities with the novel except the idea of a deadly virus. No character names, events, or even locations appear in both the book and the film.&lt;ref name="Vern"/&gt;

The film is Seagal's only effort to date in which he co-stars with his daughter, actress [[Ayako Fujitani]], and is notable for an extremely low amount of action scenes compared to Seagal's other work.

==Reception==

The film has received generally negative reviews, with critics frequently singling out the extremely low number of action sequences. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews called it "dull" and criticized its lack of action (he claims, "Out of a 90 minute movie, there's maybe 10 minutes of actual Seagal hand-to-hand combat") and unwelcome political messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mini Reviews (January 2001)|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini2.htm#patriot|author=David Nusair|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Seagalogy]]'' author Vern argues that "in many ways ''The Patriot'' is an admirable effort," noting "The production values and acting are better than some of Seagal's subsequent movies," but going on to point out that due to its "ridiculously low action quotient it is a least-favorite of many Seagal fans."&lt;ref name=Vern/&gt; As of 2 October 2014, the film has a 22% "rotten" critics rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (based on 9 reviews).&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1085744-patriot/|title=The Patriot - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Raising of Lazarus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Raising of Lazarus'', [[Rembrandt]]. Oil on panel. 37 15/16 x 32 in. (96.36 x 81.28 cm). c. 1630-32. Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]

'''''The Raising of Lazarus''''' is an [[oil-on-panel]] painting by the Dutch artist [[Rembrandt]] from early in his career; it was probably painted between 1630 and 1632.  The work depicts the [[Raising of Lazarus]] as told in the [[Gospel of John]], Chapter 11. It is in the collection of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].

==Imagery==
The painting shows the moment Lazarus re-awakens from death and rises from his tomb as Christ calls him.  Lazarus is in the darker half of the painting while the figures at left are far more illuminated than he.  Mary and those assembled look on in amazement as Lazarus comes to life.  The painting depicts a parable of spiritual life, the miracle of the hardened sinner receiving first grace (sorrow for sins committed in order to seek penitence and redemption).&lt;ref&gt;Sister Wendy’s American Collection: LACMA, VHS. (2000; Boston, MA: WGBH/ Spire Films, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rembrandt used [[chiaroscuro]] (contrasts of light and dark) in this painting, with the dark interior of the burial cave and the limited torchlight focusing the attention of the viewer and giving the figures impact.  This is one of relatively few religious subjects from the [[New Testament]] that Rembrandt painted, though there are many such prints.

==History==
Rembrandt painted ''The Raising of Lazarus'' early in his career, while he was still in [[Leiden]], and not long after his apprenticeship under [[Pieter Lastman]], whose influence is clear. Rembrandt made two [[etchings]] on the same subject but with differing compositions, one in approximately 1632 and another in 1642 (see gallery below). The 1632 etching shows a different point of view while the 1642 etching shows different figures in the cave. The 1642 etching also depicts Christ as more of a healer, rather than the enchanter of this work. (Sister [[Wendy Beckett]] opines that Jesus is portrayed in this work as a weary magician rather than a triumphant savior.) The subject of this painting may draw on an undated [[Jan Lievens]] etching of the same name.  Lievens and Rembrandt were friends and probably worked together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Stechow]], “Rembrandt's representations of the Raising of Lazarus,” Bulletin of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] 19, no. 2 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  The composition of the painting may derive from a drawing by Rembrandt from the same time as the ''Burial of Christ.''  Rembrandt would most closely imitate ''Raising of Lazarus'' with his 1635/1639 painting ''The Resurrection.''  The placement of the figures is similar and a study of drawings indicates that the latter was developed from the former.

==Provenance==
''Raising of Lazarus'' was owned by Rembrandt for most of his life; it was sold in his bankruptcy sale in 1656.&lt;ref&gt;Ben B. Johnson, “Examination and treatment of Rembrandt's Raising of Lazarus,” Bulletin of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 20, no. 2 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was inventoried as being hung in Rembrandt’s anteroom.  The painting passed through various owners in Europe until it was bought by [[Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr.]] in 1959 and then donated to the LA County Museum of Art.

== Gallery ==
Rembrandt made drawings and etchings on the same theme.

'''''The Satanic Bible''''' is a collection of essays, observations, and [[ritual]]s published by [[Anton LaVey]] in 1969. It is the central [[religious text]] of [[LaVeyan Satanism]], and is considered the foundation of its [[philosophy]] and [[dogma]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 105}} It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 116}} Though ''The Satanic Bible'' is not considered to be [[religious text|sacred scripture]] in the way that the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian Bible]] is to [[Christianity]], LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 105}} as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status.{{sfn|Gallagher|2013|p = 121}} It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as "[[Atheism|atheistic]] Satanists"{{sfn|Muzzatti|2005|p = 874}} because they believe that [[God]] is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection of their own personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in their life.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p = 143}}{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p = 40}} There have been thirty [[print run|printings]] of ''The Satanic Bible'',{{sfn|Hallman|2006|p=115}} through which it has sold over a million copies.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=54}}

''The Satanic Bible'' is composed of four books: ''The Book of Satan'', ''The Book of Lucifer'', ''The Book of Belial'', and ''The Book of Leviathan''. ''The Book of Satan'' challenges the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Golden Rule]], and promotes [[Epicureanism]].{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=30}} ''The Book of Lucifer'' holds most of the philosophy in ''The Satanic Bible'', with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In ''The Book of Belial'', LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121–140}} ''The Book of Leviathan'' provides four [[invocation]]s for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from [[John Dee]]'s [[Enochian magic|Enochian keys]]), provided both in [[Enochian]] and in English translation.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=157–272}}

There have been both positive and negative reactions to ''The Satanic Bible''. It has been described as "razor-sharp"{{sfn|Metzger|2008|p=278}} and "influential".{{sfn|Bromley|2005|pp=8127–8128}} Criticism of ''The Satanic Bible'' stems both from qualms over LaVey's writing and disapproval of the content itself. LaVey has been criticized for [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] sections,{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=49}} and accusations have been made that his philosophies are largely borrowed.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=113–115}}{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} ''The Satanic Bible'' has been heavily condemned as dangerous, particularly to adolescents.{{sfn|Linedecker|1991|pp=77–95}} Attempts have been made to ban the book in schools, public libraries, and prisons,{{sfn|Steinberg|1986}}{{sfn|Lam|1999}}{{sfn|Bogan|2011}} though these attempts are somewhat rare.{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=530}}

==History==

There are multiple stories of the birth of ''The Satanic Bible''. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest [[Peter H. Gilmore]] describes LaVey as having compiled ''The Satanic Bible'' on his own from [[monograph]]s he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists a number of people who influenced LaVey's writings: [[Ayn Rand]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[H. L. Mencken]], the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, [[P. T. Barnum]], [[Mark Twain]], [[John Milton]], and [[Lord Byron]].{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=14}}

LaVey's estranged daughter [[Zeena Schreck]], in an exposé about both her father's religion and past, attributes the birth of ''The Satanic Bible'' to a suggestion by [[Peter Mayer]], a publisher for [[Avon (publishers)|Avon]].{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible to draw from the popularity of the 1968 horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both [[Satanism]] and other [[occult]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;There is some disagreement over this claim: Gilmore states in the introduction that it was in fact LaVeyan Satanism that influenced ''Rosemary's Baby''.&lt;/ref&gt; Schreck states that, aided by [[Diane Hegarty]], LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in ''The Cloven Hoof'', a [[Church of Satan]] newsletter.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=192}}{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}}

Either to meet length requirements set by the publisher{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=49}} or out of agreement with the ideas,{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=14}} LaVey and Hegarty borrowed heavily from writings by other authors. These included a [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] book published in 1890 entitled ''[[Might Is Right]]'' by Ragnar Redbeard, as well as Dee's Enochian keys from [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[The Equinox]]'', modified to replace references to Christianity with those to Satan.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Some accuse LaVey of [[paraphrase|paraphrasing]] the ''Nine Satanic Statements'' from Rand's ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' without acknowledgement, though others maintain that LaVey was simply drawing inspiration from the novel.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Petersen|2009|p=50}} LaVey later affirmed the connection with Rand's ideas by stating that LaVeyan Satanism was "just Ayn Rand's philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added".{{sfn|Ellis|2000|p=180}}

===Publication history===
Originally published in paperback by Avon in 1969, ''The Satanic Bible'' has had thirty printings{{sfn|Hallman|2006|p=115}} and has never gone out of print.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=146}} A hardcover edition was published by University Books that same year but has now been out of print for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shoup|first1=Leonard|title=The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey - the Rare Hardcover 1st Edition|url=http://www.biblio.com/the-satanic-bible-by-lavey-anton-szandor/work/39572|website=Biblio|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, William Morrow published a new hardcover edition of the book combined in a single volume with its companion work, ''The Satanic Rituals'', and marketed under a special arrangement by Rabid Crow Arts and Graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satanic Bible Hardcover|url=http://www.rabidcrow.com/#!satanic-bible-hard-cover/ccqv|website=Rabid Crow Arts and Graphics|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main content has not changed throughout the editions, although the dedication was removed after several printings and the introduction has changed several times.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|pp=54–56}} The [[Sigil of Baphomet]] has been printed on the cover since the original publication.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|pp=20–21}} ''The Satanic Bible'' has sold over one million copies since its initial release.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|pp=54–56}} It has also been translated into Danish, Swedish, German, Spanish, Finnish and Turkish.{{sfn|Ankarloo|Clark|1999|p=95}}

==Content==

===Dedication===
Though it is no longer included in current printings of ''The Satanic Bible'', early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences. LaVey's primary dedication was to [[Bernardino Nogara]] (misprinted as "Logara"), [[Karl Haushofer]], [[Grigori Rasputin]], [[Basil Zaharoff]], [[Alessandro Cagliostro]], [[Barnabas]], [[Might Is Right|Ragnar Redbeard]], [[William Mortensen]], Hans Brick, [[Max Reinhardt]], Orrin Klapp, [[Fritz Lang]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[P. T. Barnum]], [[Hans Poelzig]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], and [[Mark Twain]]. The secondary dedication named [[Howard Hughes]], James Moody, [[Marcello Truzzi]], Adrian‐Claude Frazier, [[Marilyn Monroe]], Wesley Mather, [[William Lindsay Gresham]], [[Hugo Zacchini]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], Frederick Goerner, C. Huntley, [[Nathanael West]], [[Horatio Alger|Horatio Alger Jr.]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[George Orwell]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Tuesday Weld]], [[H. G. Wells]], Sister Marie Koven, [[Harry Houdini]], Togare (LaVey's pet lion), and the Nine Unknown Men from ''[[The Nine Unknown]]''.{{sfn|LaVey|1969}}

===Introductions===
Throughout the various printings of ''The Satanic Bible'', it has included introductions by various authors. The first edition (in print from 1969 to 1972) included an excerpt from an article by Burton H. Wolfe, an [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] and biographer of LaVey, entitled "The Church that Worships Satan". Wolfe provides an extensive biography of LaVey and a history of the Church of Satan. He mentions ''Rosemary's Baby'' as contributing to the popularity of Satanism, though he does not claim LaVeyan Satanism to have directly influenced its creation.{{sfn|LaVey|1969|pp=13–16}} From 1972 until 1976, the introduction to ''The Satanic Bible'' was a piece by Michael A. Aquino, who later went on to found the [[Temple of Set]] with a number of members of the Church of Satan. He gives a detailed analysis of the Satanic philosophies, and dispels myths about LaVeyan Satanism. He explains that it is not "[[devil worship]]", and that LaVeyan Satanists in fact reject the worship of external gods completely. He too provides a brief background on LaVey, explaining how LaVey brought some of the knowledge he had acquired while working with the circus to his religion.{{sfn|LaVey|1972}} Wolfe again wrote the introduction for the 1976 to 2005 editions of ''The Satanic Bible''. It included some of the same content as the 1969 version, with an expanded biography of LaVey and more information on the various conflicts between other religions and LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfn|LaVey|1976}} Since 2005, ''The Satanic Bible'' has contained an introduction written by Gilmore, High Priest of the Church of Satan. In this introduction, he discusses his discovery of LaVeyan Satanism and his relationship with LaVey. He then goes on to provide a detailed biography of LaVey and addresses allegations that LaVey falsified much of the story of his own past. The introduction also provides a history of ''The Satanic Bible'' itself, as well as that of two other books by LaVey: ''[[The Satanic Witch]]'' and ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]''.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=18}}

===Preface===
LaVey explains his reasons for writing ''The Satanic Bible'' in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors on the subject of magic,{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=55}} dismissing them as "nothing more than sanctimonious fraud" and "volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy". He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by "[[Left-hand path and right-hand path#Right-Hand Path|right-hand path]]" authors. He tells that ''The Satanic Bible'' contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, "What you see may not always please you, but you ''will see''!"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=21–22}}

===Prologue===
The prologue to ''The Satanic Bible'' begins by discussing the concept of gods, good and evil, and human nature. It includes the Nine Satanic Statements: 
{{blockquote| 
#Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!
#Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams!
#Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self-deceit!
#Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates!
#Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek!
#Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires!
#Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his "divine spiritual and intellectual development," has become the most vicious animal of all!
#Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!
#Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years!{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=25}}}}

The Nine Satanic Statements outline the basic ideology of LaVeyan Satanism, and have become some of the guiding principles of LaVeyan Satanism. They also served as a template for later publications by LaVey, such as his 1987 "Nine Satanic Sins".{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=192}} [[Ayn Rand]]'s influence on LaVeyan Satanism is apparent in the Nine Satanic Statements, leading some, namely [[Nikolas Schreck]], to assert that the Statements are simply unacknowledged paraphrase of Rand's thoughts.{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} These accusations have been disproved, however.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=9}}

===''The Book of Satan''===
Much of the first book of ''The Satanic Bible'' is taken from parts of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', edited to remove [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[misogyny]].{{sfn|Redbeard|1927|p=12}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2013|p=120}} It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates social Darwinism, saying, "Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=30}} Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and "lust and carnal desire" are singled out as part of humans' intrinsic nature.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=32}} ''The Book of Satan'' suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, "I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness." Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged to make the most of their lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of "good" and "evil".{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=30}} Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies that he or she uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be irrefutable truths are identified as the most dangerous.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=31–32}} The last part of ''The Book of Satan'' is an adaptation of the Christian [[Beatitudes]], changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=34–35}}

===''The Book of Lucifer''===
''The Book of Lucifer'' contains the majority of the philosophy of ''The Satanic Bible''. It details how Christianity has taught that God is good and [[Satan]] is evil,{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=301}} and presents an alternate view. It describes that the concept of Satan, used synonymously with "God", is different for each LaVeyan Satanist, but that to all it represents a good and steadying force in their life. Believers have been called "atheistic Satanists" because of this lack of belief in external gods,{{sfn|Muzzatti|2005|p=874}} but others identify as [[antitheism|antitheistic]].{{sfn|Abma|2011}} Satan is seen to LaVeyan Satanists not as "an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns", but as a force of nature that has only been described as evil by other religions.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=62}} Satan is viewed as a metaphor{{sfn|Abma|2011}} or a symbol, not as a being to be worshipped.{{sfn|Perlmutter|LaVey|2003}}

LaVey rejects the idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists to take action to fix a situation instead of asking for a solution.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=40–41}} The [[seven deadly sins]] are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of "controlled selfishness", in the sense that doing something to help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" to "Do unto others as they do unto you" so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=51}} ''The Book of Lucifer'' also contains a list of "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" (Satan, [[Lucifer]], [[Belial]], and [[Leviathan]]){{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=57}} and of seventy-seven "[[The infernal names|Infernal Names]]", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=58–60}} They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=57}}

''The Book of Lucifer'' contains a long chapter titled "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity as well as misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex is the most important element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in [[orgy|orgies]] or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own [[Human sexual activity|sexualities]] as they please, without harming others.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=66–74}} Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human [[sacrifice]]. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a [[human sacrifice]] would be to accomplish two goals: to "release the magician's wrath" as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request in the form of a curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=87–90}} In ''The Book of Lucifer'', LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of [[reincarnation]]. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of [[euthanasia]], where it would end extreme suffering.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=91–95}} Because the Satanist is considered their own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are [[Walpurgisnacht]] and [[Halloween]]. [[Solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es are also celebrated.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=96–98}}

===''The Book of Belial''===
The third book of ''The Satanic Bible'' describes rituals and magic.{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=301}} According to Joshua Gunn, these are adapted from books of ritual magic such as Crowley's ''[[Magick (Book 4)#Part II: Magick (Elementary Theory)|Magick: Elementary Theory]]''.{{sfn|Gunn|2005|p=102}} ''The Satanic Rituals'', published by LaVey in 1972, outlines the rituals more precisely, and contains the entire text of the Black Mass.{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=302}} LaVey begins ''The Book of Belial'' by defining magic as "The change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable."{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=110}} He explains that some of the rituals are simply applied psychology or science, but that some contain parts with no scientific basis.

LaVey explains that, in order to control a person, one must first attract their attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=111–113}} In the ''Book of Belial'', he discusses three types of rituals: those for sex, compassion, and destruction. Sex rituals work to entice another person; compassion rituals work to improve health, intelligence, success, and so on; destruction rituals work to destroy another person.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=114–117}} LaVey advocates finding others with whom to practice Satanic rituals in order to reaffirm one's faith and avoid antisocial behavior. He particularly advocates group participation for destruction rituals, as compassion and sex rituals are more private in nature.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=119}} LaVey goes on to list the key components to successful ritual: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and "The Balance Factor" (awareness of one's own limitations).{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121–128}} Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in ''The Book of Belial'', and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of [[Baphomet]]) are given.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=130–136}}

===''The Book of Leviathan''===
The final book of ''The Satanic Bible'' emphasizes the importance of spoken word and emotion to effective magic.{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=301}} An "Invocation to Satan" as well as three invocations for the three types of ritual are given.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} The "Invocation to Satan" commands the dark forces to grant power to the summoner, and lists the Infernal names for use in the invocation. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of lust" is used for attracting the attentions of another. Both male and female versions of the invocation are provided. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of destruction" commands the dark forces to destroy the subject of the invocation. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of compassion" requests protection, health, strength, and the destruction of anything ailing the subject of the invocation.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} The rest of ''The Book of Leviathan'' is composed of the Enochian Keys, which LaVey adapted from Dee's original work. They are given in Enochian and also translated into English.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=155–272}} LaVey provides a brief introduction that credits Dee and explains some of the history behind the Enochian Keys and language. He maintains that the translations provided are an "unvarnishing" of the translations performed by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in the 1800s,{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=155}} but others accuse LaVey of simply changing references to Christianity with those to Satan.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}}

==Themes==

===God and Satan===
''The Satanic Bible'' often uses the terms "God" and "Satan" interchangeably,{{sfn|Muzzatti|2005|p=874}} except when referring to the concepts of these as viewed by other religions. LaVey also occasionally uses the term "God" to refer to other religions' views of God, and "Satan" or synonyms to refer to the idea of god as interpreted by LaVeyan Satanism, as when he writes, "When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from 'God'; closer to the 'Devil.'"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=45}} Throughout ''The Satanic Bible'', the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true "self"—a projection of their own personality—not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}} Satan is also used as a metaphor for the ideas connected with the early Christian view of Satan or the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]]: wise, defiant, questioning, and free-thinking.{{sfn|Hughes|2011|p=1}} LaVey discusses this extensively in ''The Book of Lucifer'', explaining that the gods worshipped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of [[narcissism]] that would accompany self-worship.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=44–45}}
{{quote|1=If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of "God," then why fear his true self, in fearing "God,"—why praise his true self in praising "God,"—why remain externalized from "God" {{smallcaps|in order to engage in ritual and religious ceremony in his name?}}&lt;br /&gt;Man needs ritual and dogma, but no law states that an ''externalized'' god is necessary in order to engage in ritual and ceremony performed in a god's name! Could it be that when he closes the gap between himself and his "God" he sees the demon of pride creeping forth—that very embodiment of Lucifer appearing in his midst?|2=Anton LaVey|3=''The Satanic Bible'', pp. 44–45}}
Though at some points LaVey refers to Satan as a physical being, this is intended to encourage the Satanist's "rational self-interest."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=291}}

===Science===
Many of the ideas in ''The Satanic Bible'' are shaped around a [[secularism|secular]], scientific view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=3–4}} These forces are said to be manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with [[Christian Science]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}

James Lewis argues that scientific themes are so prevalent in ''The Satanic Bible'' because LaVey was appealing to the authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=14}}

===Human nature and Social Darwinism===
Social Darwinism and the concept of "human nature" are ideas that are prevalent throughout ''The Satanic Bible''. LaVey describes Satanism as "a religion based on the universal traits of man,"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=53}} and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human's natural instinct, and are thus advocated.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=46}} Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in ''The Book of Satan'', where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=47}} LaVeyan Satanism has been described as "institutionalism of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] self-interest" because of many of these themes.{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=528}}

==Influence==
''The Satanic Bible'' is recognized as one of the key texts of modern Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Petersen|2009|p=52}}{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=225}} The Church of Satan requires that people accept "LaVey's principles" before becoming members of the church. Many other Satanist groups and individual Satanists who are not part of the Church of Satan also recognize LaVey's work as influential.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=4}} Many Satanists attribute their conversions or discoveries of Satanism to ''The Satanic Bible'', with 20% of respondents to a survey by James Lewis mentioning ''The Satanic Bible'' directly as influencing their conversion.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=117}}
In Gilmore's introduction, he lists a number of novels and films supposedly influenced by ''The Satanic Bible'' and LaVeyan Satanism. These include the novels ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' by [[Ira Levin]] and ''[[Our Lady of Darkness]]'' by [[Fritz Leiber]], as well as films such as ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[The Devil's Rain]]'', ''[[The Car]]'', and ''Dr. Dracula''.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=15}} Others have lauded ''The Satanic Bible'' as heavily influential on [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[rock music|rock]] bands{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=9}} such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]],{{sfn|Cope|2010|p=83,104}} [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]],{{sfn|Kajzer|Lotring|2009|p=109}} and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]].{{sfn|Petersen|2009|p=205}}

==Reception==
[[Richard Metzger]] describes ''The Satanic Bible'' as "a razor-sharp, no-bullshit primer in [[natural law|natural]] and [[divine law|supernatural law]]."{{sfn|Metzger|2008|p=278}} [[David G. Bromley]] calls it "[[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]" and "the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology."{{sfn|Bromley|2005|pp=8127–8128}} [[Eugene V. Gallagher]] says that Satanists use LaVey's writings "as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos." He also states: "With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey's ''Satanic Bible'' promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace."{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=6530}} The philosophy it presents has been described as "strident [[libertarianism]]" and "an obvious distillation of ideas common among members of the United States [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter-culture in the 1960s]]."{{sfn|Gunn|2005|pp=102–103}} Joshua Gunn argues that the significance of ''The Satanic Bible'' as an occult item owes to its status as a "[[totem]] or a [[fetishism|fetishized]] object in popular culture", not the philosophy contained within. He argues that many erroneously categorize the content of ''The Satanic Bible'' as evil and depraved from the minimalist, dark cover design (composed of a purple Sigil of Baphomet and white text on the front, and a photo of LaVey superimposed over the Sigil of Baphomet on the back), the verbose, overblown style of the text, and the presence of the word "Satan" in the title. Contrary to this belief, he says, the philosophy presented by LaVey is "neither offensive nor surprising."{{sfn|Gunn|2005|pp=102–105}}

[[Zeena Schreck]] has criticized ''The Satanic Bible'' as a financial endeavor suggested by Avon publisher, Mayer. She maintains that it contains large amounts of falsified information about LaVey's past, and that much of the book is plagiarized from Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', Dee's Enochian Keys, and Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} Chris Mathews, in ''Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture'', describes ''The Satanic Bible'' as "hastily prepared" and cynical. Both Mathews and a 1971 article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' compare the ideologies presented in ''The Satanic Bible'' to [[Nazism]]: containing "unremitting focus on social elitism, appeals to force, and scorn for egalitarian principles".{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=xvii}} [[Israel Regardie]] criticized LaVey's alteration of the Enochian Keys in ''The Book of Leviathan'' as stupid and of lower quality than the original Keys.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=56}}

''The Satanic Bible'' has also received a large amount of criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of "[[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|Satanic panic]]," when [[Satanic ritual abuse]] was feared to be epidemic.{{sfn|Versluis|2006|p=116}} Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as "uncritical and sensationalized."{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=531}} [[Tom Harpur]] condemns the book as "blasphemous" and "socially seditious," and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts.{{sfn|Harpur|1989}} Critics have also accused ''The Satanic Bible'' of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable.{{sfn|Linedecker|1991|pp=77–95}} Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted.{{sfn|Perlmutter|LaVey|2003}} Possession of ''The Satanic Bible'' has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]],{{sfn|Swatos|1992|p=162}} and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues.{{sfn|Brown|1989}} The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of ''The Satanic Bible''. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for ''The Satanic Bible'' in their children's bedrooms, saying, "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction"{{sfn|Brown|1989}} and "It's like giving drugs to a kid who is already on the edge."{{sfn|MacLeod|1990}} Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world,{{sfn|Steinberg|1986}}{{sfn|Lam|1999}} and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court.{{sfn|Bogan|2011}}{{sfn|USA Today|1990}}{{sfn|Associated Press|1990}} However, opposition to ''The Satanic Bible'' has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare.{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=530}} The book was banned in [[South Africa]] from 1973 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Censored publications: ID 9914286|url=http://search.beaconforfreedom.org/search/censored_publications/publication.html?id=9914286|publisher=Beacon for Freedom of Expression|accessdate=4 May 2013|quote=Period of censorship: June 22, 1973 – January 22, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory of Colours''''' (German: ''Zur Farbenlehre'') is a book by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] about the poet's views on the nature of [[color|colours]] and how these are perceived by humans. It was published in German in 1810 and in English in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=  |first=  |title= Goethe's Theory of Colours: Translated from the German; with Notes by Charles Lock Eastlake, R.A., F.R.S |publisher= John Murray |place= London |url= https://archive.org/stream/goethestheoryco01goetgoog#page/n6/mode/2up |year= 1840 |accessdate= 18 October 2017 |via= Internet Archive |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161212075843/https://archive.org/stream/goethestheoryco01goetgoog#page/n6/mode/2up |archivedate= 12 December 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains detailed descriptions of phenomena such as [[Complementary colors|coloured shadows]], [[refraction]], and [[chromatic aberration]].

The work originated in Goethe's occupation with painting and mainly exerted an influence on the arts ([[Philipp Otto Runge]], [[J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]]). The book is a successor to two short essays entitled "Contributions to Optics".

Although Goethe's work was rejected by physicists, a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it, including [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (see: ''[[On&amp;nbsp;Vision and Colors]]''), [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Kurt Gödel]], and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]].

Goethe's book provides a catalogue of how colour is perceived in a wide variety of circumstances, and considers [[Isaac Newton]]'s observations to be special cases.&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle"&gt;Neil Ribe, Friedrich Steinle: [https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.1506750 Exploratory Experimentation: Goethe, Land, and Color Theory] ''[[Physics Today]]'', July 2002, retrieved July 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the [[optical spectrum]], as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by [[Wittgenstein]] in his comments on Goethe's theory in ''[[Remarks on Colour]]''.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Goethe-Prism-FigI.jpg|thumb|250px|Reddish-yellow edges overlap blue-cyan edges to form green.]]
At Goethe's time, it was generally acknowledged that, as [[Isaac Newton]] had shown in his ''[[Opticks]]'' in 1704, colourless (white) [[light]] is split up into its component [[color|colours]] when directed through a [[prism (optics)|prism]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;528. "das zentrale Axiom von Newtons Farbentheorie, daß in dem weißen, farblosen Licht alle Farben enthalten seien" (''"the central axiom of Newton's colour theory that there were all colours in the white, colourless light"'')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Along with the rest of the world I was convinced that all the colours are contained in the light; no one had ever told me anything different, and I had never found the least cause to doubt it, because I had no further interest in the subject.}}

{{quote|But how I was astonished, as I looked at a white wall through the prism, that it stayed white! That only where it came upon some darkened area, it showed some colour, then at last, around the window sill all the colours shone... It didn't take long before I knew here was something significant about colour to be brought forth, and I spoke as through an instinct out loud, that the Newtonian teachings were false.|Goethe&lt;ref&gt;Goethe, Goethes Werke, Weimar: Hermann Böhlau, 1887–1919, II. Abtheilung: Naturwissenschaftlichte Schriften, Bd. 4, pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Castel L'Optique des couleurs 1740.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Castel's 1740 comparison of Newton's spectral colour description with his explanation in terms of the interaction of light and dark, which Goethe later developed into his ''Theory of Colours'']]

Goethe's starting point was the supposed discovery of how Newton erred in the prismatic experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei, Rupprecht. Über die Anfänge von Goethes Farbenlehre (''On the beginnings of Goethe's Theory of Colours''). In: Jahrbuch der [[Goethe-Gesellschaft]] (''Yearbook of the Goethe Society'') 11, 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;259, cited in Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;553. "Goethes Ausgangspunkt, die Entdeckung des Newtonschen Irrtums, wie er es nannte, im prismatischen Versuch, schwand ihm aus dem Blickfeld in dem Maße, als er die Bedeutung der Physiologischen Farben zu ahnen begann." (''"Goethe's starting point, the discovery of the Newton error, as he called it, in the prismatic experiment, dwindled from his horizon according to how he began to sense the meaning of the Physiological Colours."'')&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1793 Goethe had formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay "Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität" (''"On Newton's hypothesis of diverse refrangibility"'').&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;528. "Bereits 1793 hat Goethe seine Einwände gegen Newton formuliert in dem Aufsatz ''Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität'' (...)." (''"Already in 1793, Goethe formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay ''Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität'' [...]."'')&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, by 1794, Goethe had begun to increasingly note the importance of the physiological aspect of colours.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;553. "Diese Wendung ist bereits angedeutet in Goethes Briefentwurf an Sömmerring vom Januar/Februar 1794, der Antwort auf Sömmerrings Brief an Goethe vom 18. Januar 1794 (...): ''Es ist weit mehr Physiologisches bei den Farbenerscheinungen, als man denkt, nur ist hier die Schwierigkeit noch größer als in andern Fällen, das Objektive vom Subjektiven zu unterscheiden''." (Italics mark citations that may only slightly have been adapted to the descriptive sentence regarding the grammar.) Translation: ''"This change is already indicated in Goethe's draft for a letter to Sömmerring from January/February 1794, the answer to Sömmerring's letter from January 18, 1794 (...): There is much more physiological with the phenomena of colours than one would think, just that it is even more difficult, here, to distinguish between the objective and the subjective."'' The letter is cited by Mandelkow after: Goethe, Die Schriften zur Naturwissenschaft. Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher (Leopoldina) zu Halle von R. Matthaei, W. Troll und L. Wolf. Weimar 1949 ff (''Goethe, The writings on sciences. Edited on behalf of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]] at Halle by R. Matthaei, W. Troll and L. Wolf. Weimar 1949 et seq.'') See: [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Goethe notes in the historical section, [[Louis Bertrand Castel]] had already published a criticism of Newton's spectral description of prismatic colour in 1740&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = L'Optique des couleurs | publisher = Paris | year = 1740 | author = Louis-Bertrand Castel}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he observed that the sequence of colours split by a prism depended on the distance from the prism—and that Newton was looking at a special case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Instruments and the Imagination | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6665 | pages = 347–348 | author = Thomas L. Hankins and Robert J. Silverman | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-691-00549-2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=O9e_7E22caAC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=castel+goethe+colour#PPA83,M1 | bibcode = 1998Natur.391..347S | doi = 10.1038/34821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Whereas Newton observed the colour spectrum cast on a wall at a fixed distance away from the prism, Goethe observed the cast spectrum on a white card which was progressively moved away from the prism... As the card was moved away, the projected image elongated, gradually assuming an elliptical shape, and the coloured images became larger, finally merging at the centre to produce green. Moving the card farther led to the increase in the size of the image, until finally the spectrum described by Newton in the Opticks was produced... The image cast by the refracted beam was not fixed, but rather developed with increasing distance from the prism. Consequently, Goethe saw the particular distance chosen by Newton to prove the second proposition of the Opticks as capriciously imposed." (Alex Kentsis, Between Light and Eye)&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0511130 | Alex Kentsis, Between Light and Eye&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The theory we set up against this begins with colourless light, and avails itself of outward conditions, to produce coloured phenomena; but it concedes worth and dignity to these conditions. It does not arrogate to itself developing colours from the light, but rather seeks to prove by numberless cases that colour is produced by light as well as by what stands against it.|Goethe&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;528. "Die Lehre dagegen, die wir mit Überzeugung aufstellen, beginnt zwar auch mit dem farblosen Lichte, sie bedient sich äußerer Bedingungen, um farbige Erscheinungen hervorzubringen; sie gesteht aber diesen Bedingungen Wert und Würde zu. Sie maßt sich nicht an, Farben aus dem Licht zu entwickeln, sie sucht vielmehr durch unzählige Fälle darzutun, dass die Farbe zugleich von dem Lichte und von dem, was sich ihm entgegenstellt, hervorgebracht werde."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the preface to the ''Theory of Colours'', Goethe explained that he tried to apply the principle of ''polarity'', in the work—a proposition that belonged to his earliest convictions and was constitutive of his entire study of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;530. "Das für Goethes gesamte Naturbetrachtung konstitutive Prinzip der Polarität gehört zu ''seinen frühesten Überzeugungen''..., ''an denen er niemals irre geworden sei'' (Brief an Schweigger, 25. April 1814). Im Vorwort zur ''Farbenlehre'' wird es als ''Hauptabsicht des gegenwärtigen Werkes'' bezeichnet, dieses universelle Prinzip auch ''auf die Farbenlehre anzuwenden''." (Italics mark citations that may only slightly have been adapted to the descriptive sentence regarding the grammar.) Translation: ''"The principle of polarity, that is constitutive for all of Goethe's study of nature, belongs to ''the earliest of his convictions''..., ''that he had never lost faith in'' (letter to Schweigger, April 25, 1814). In the preface to the ''Theory of Colours'', it is called ''the main intention of the work at hand to apply'' this universal principle also ''to the theory of colours''."'' See [[Johann Schweigger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goethe's theory ==
{{quote|Goethe's theory of the constitution of colours of the spectrum has not proved to be an unsatisfactory theory, rather it really isn't a theory at all. Nothing can be predicted with it. It is, rather a vague schematic outline of the sort we find in [[William James|James]]'s psychology. Nor is there any ''[[experimentum crucis]]'' which could decide for or against the theory. |[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''Remarks on Colour, paragraphs 70''}}

It is hard to present Goethe's "theory", since he refrains from setting up any actual theory; he says, "its intention is to portray rather than explain" (''Scientific Studies''&lt;ref name="Goethe 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Goethe | first = Johann | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = Douglas | title = Scientific Studies (Goethe: The Collected Works, Vol. 12), p.57 | publisher = Princeton University Press |date=October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Instead of setting up models and explanations, Goethe collected specimens—he was responsible for the meteorological collections of Jena University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamm|first1=E. P.|title=Unpacking Goethe's Collections: The Public and the Private in Natural-Historical Collecting|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=2001|volume=34|issue=3|pages=275–300|jstor=4028099}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, he had amassed over 17,800 minerals in his personal collection—the largest in all of Europe. He took the same approach to colour—instead of narrowing and isolating things to a single 'experimentum crucis' (or critical experiment that would prove or disprove his theory), he sought to gain as much breadth for his understanding as possible by developing a wide-ranging exposition through which is revealed the essential character of colour—without having to resort to explanations and theories about perceived phenomena such as 'wavelengths' or 'particles'.

"The crux of his color theory is its experiential source: rather than impose theoretical statements, Goethe sought to allow light and color to be displayed in an ordered series of experiments that readers could experience for themselves." (Seamon, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seamon | first = David | editor-last = Seamon | editor-first = David | editor2-last = Zajonc | editor2-first = Arthur | title = Goethe's Way of Science: A Phenomenology of Nature | place = Albany, NY | year = 1998 | publisher = State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Goethe, "Newton's error.. was trusting math over the sensations of his eye." (Jonah Lehrer, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer|[http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2006/12/post_7.php ''Goethe and Color''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128012817/http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2006/12/post_7.php |date=2007-01-28 }}, December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

To stay true to the perception without resort to explanation was the essence of Goethe's method. What he provided was really not so much a theory, as a ''rational description'' of colour. For Goethe, "the highest is to understand that all fact is really theory. The blue of the sky reveals to us the basic law of color. Search nothing beyond the phenomena, they themselves are the theory."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in translation in: {{cite journal | last = Hughes | first = Peter | title = Performing Theory: Wittgenstein and the Trouble with Shakespeare | journal = Comparative Criticism | year = 1992 | volume = 14 | pages = 85 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[Goethe] delivered in full measure what was promised by the title of his excellent work: ''Data for a Theory of Color.'' They are important, complete, and significant data, rich material for a future theory of color. He has not, however, undertaken to furnish the theory itself; hence, as he himself remarks and admits on page xxxix of the introduction, he has not furnished us with a real explanation of the essential nature of color, but really postulates it as a phenomenon, and merely tells us how it originates, not what it is. The physiological colors ... he represents as a phenomenon, complete and existing by itself, without even attempting to show their relation to the physical colors, his principal theme. ... it is really a systematic presentation of facts, but it stops short at this. |[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], ''[[On&amp;nbsp;Vision and Colors]]'', Introduction}}

Goethe outlines his method in the essay, ''The experiment as mediator between subject and object'' (1772).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.slc.edu/~eraymond/bestfoot.html|title=Faces of Philosophy – Elfie Raymond|first=Elfie|last=Raymond|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110082845/http://pages.slc.edu/~eraymond/bestfoot.html|archivedate=2011-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It underscores his experiential standpoint. "The human being himself, to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist." (Goethe, ''Scientific Studies''&lt;ref name="Goethe 1995" /&gt;)

{{quote|I believe that what Goethe was really seeking was not a physiological but a psychological theory of colours. |[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''Culture and Value, MS 112 255:26.11.1931}}

=== Light and darkness ===

Unlike his contemporaries, Goethe didn't see darkness as an absence of light, but rather as polar to and interacting with light; colour resulted from this interaction of light and shadow. For Goethe, light is ''"the simplest most undivided most homogenous being that we know. Confronting it is the darkness"'' (Letter to Jacobi).

{{quote|...they maintained that ''shade is a part of light''. It sounds absurd when I express it; but so it is: for they said that ''colours'', which are shadow and the result of shade, ''are light itself''.|[[Johann Eckermann]]|[[Conversations of Goethe]], entry: January 4, 1824; trans. Wallace Wood}}

Based on his experiments with turbid media, Goethe characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light. [[Rudolf Steiner]], the science editor for the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, gave the following analogy:

{{quote|Modern natural science sees darkness as a complete nothingness. According to this view, the light which streams into a dark space has no resistance from the darkness to overcome. Goethe pictures to himself that light and darkness relate to each other like the north and south pole of a magnet. The darkness can weaken the light in its working power. Conversely, the light can limit the energy of the darkness. In both cases color arises.|Rudolf Steiner, 1897&lt;ref name="Steiner 1897"&gt;{{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Rudolf | title = Goethe's  World View, Chapter III The Phenomena of the World of Colors

Goethe expresses this more succinctly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goethe | first = Johann | title = Theory of Colours, paragraph #502 | year = 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; Blue is a darkness weakened by light.}}

=== Experiments with turbid media ===

{{quote|The action of turbid media was to Goethe the ultimate fact—the Urphänomen—of the world of colours.|[[John Tyndall]], 1880&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tyndall | first = John | title = Popular Science Monthly, Volume 17, June 1880, Goethe's Farbenlehre | year = 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Goethe's studies of colour began with experiments which examined the effects of [[turbidity|turbid media]], such as air, dust, and moisture on the perception of light and dark. The poet observed that light seen through a turbid medium appears yellow, and darkness seen through an illuminated medium appears blue.

{{quote|The highest degree of light, such as that of the sun... is for the most part colourless. This light, however, seen through a medium but very slightly thickened, appears to us yellow. If the density of such a medium be increased, or if its volume become greater, we shall see the light gradually assume a yellow-red hue, which at last deepens to a ruby colour.

If on the other hand darkness is seen through a semi-transparent medium, which is itself illumined by a light striking on it, a blue colour appears: this becomes lighter and paler as the density of the medium is increased, but on the contrary appears darker and deeper the more transparent the medium becomes: in the least degree of dimness short of absolute transparence, always supposing a perfectly colourless medium, this deep blue approaches the most beautiful violet. |Goethe|''Theory of Colours'', pp. 150–151}}

He then proceeds with numerous experiments, systematically observing the effects of rarefied mediums such as dust, air, and moisture on the perception of colour.

=== Boundary conditions ===
[[File:Prism-orientation-of-light-dark-boundary.gif|thumb|right|200px|When looked at ''through'' a prism, the colours seen at a light–dark boundary depend upon the orientation of this light–dark boundary.]]

When viewed through a prism, the orientation of a light–dark boundary with respect to the prism's axis is significant. With white above a dark boundary, we observe the light extending a blue-violet edge into the dark area; whereas dark above a light boundary results in a red-yellow edge extending into the light area.

Goethe was intrigued by this difference. He felt that this arising of colour at light–dark boundaries was fundamental to the creation of the spectrum (which he considered to be a compound phenomenon).

Varying the experimental conditions by using different shades of grey shows that the intensity of coloured edges increases with boundary contrast.

=== Light and dark spectra ===

[[File:Prisma-goethe.gif|thumb|right|200px|Light and dark spectra—when coloured edges overlap in a light spectrum, green results; when they overlap in a dark spectrum, magenta results. (Click for animation)]]

Since the colour phenomenon relies on the adjacency of light and dark, there are two ways to produce a spectrum: with a light beam in a dark room, and with a dark beam (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;a shadow) in a light room.

Goethe recorded the sequence of colours projected at various distances from a prism for both cases (see Plate&amp;nbsp;IV, ''Theory of Colours''). In both cases, he found that the yellow and blue edges remain closest to the side which is light, and red and violet edges remain closest to the side which is dark. At a certain distance, these edges overlap—and we obtain Newton's spectrum. When these edges overlap in a light spectrum, green results; when they overlap in a dark spectrum, magenta results.

With a light spectrum (i.e. a shaft of light in a surrounding darkness), we find yellow-red colours along the top edge, and blue-violet colours along the bottom edge. The spectrum with green in the middle arises only where the blue-violet edges overlap the yellow-red edges. Unfortunately an optical mixture of blue and yellow gives white, not green, and so Goethe's explanation of Newton's spectrum fails.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Zajonc. "Goethe's Theory of Color and Scientific Intuition", ''American Journal of Physics'', Vol. 44, No. 4 April (1976): 3-4. 'This is of course in error since the green produced here is approximately spectral green, that is, pure green, not a mixture.' The point is that the optical mixing of the edge-spectra is additive, not subtractive.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_mixing, and that there is no combination of yellows or blues that will produce the saturated green produced when the edge-spectra start to overlap.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a dark spectrum (i.e., a shadow surrounded by light), we find violet-blue along the top edge, and red-yellow along the bottom edge—and where these edges overlap, we find (extraspectral) magenta.

== Goethe's colour wheel ==

{{quote|When the eye sees a colour it is immediately excited and it is its nature, spontaneously and of necessity, at once to produce another, which with the original colour, comprehends the whole chromatic scale. | Goethe, Theory of Colours}}

Goethe anticipated [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process]] theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html Goethe's Color Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916130507/http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html |date=2008-09-16 }}. ''Webexhibits.org'', retrieved July 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; by proposing a symmetric colour wheel. He writes, "The chromatic circle... [is] arranged in a general way according to the natural order... for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. Thus, yellow demands violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa: thus... all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other; the simpler colour demanding the compound, and vice versa (&lt;ref name="Physiologische Farben" /&gt; paragraph&amp;nbsp;#50).

{{anchor|magenta}}In the same way that light and dark spectra yielded green from the mixture of blue and yellow—Goethe completed his colour wheel by recognising the importance of magenta—"For Newton, only spectral colors could count as fundamental. By contrast, Goethe's more empirical approach led him to recognize the essential role of magenta in a complete color circle, a role that it still has in all modern color systems."&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle" /&gt;

=== Complementary colours and colours psychology ===
[[File:Goethe Schiller Die Temperamentenrose.jpg|thumb|250px|The "rose of temperaments" (''Temperamentenrose''), an earlier study (1798/9) by Goethe and [[Schiller]], matching twelve colours to human occupations or their character traits
(''tyrants, heroes, adventurers, hedonists, lovers, poets, public speakers, historians, teachers, philosophers, pedants, rulers''), grouped in the [[four temperaments]].]]

Goethe also  included aesthetic qualities in his colour wheel, under the title of "allegorical, symbolic, mystic use of colour" (''Allegorischer, symbolischer, mystischer Gebrauch der Farbe''), establishing a kind of [[color psychology]].
He  associated red with the "beautiful", orange with the "noble", yellow to the "good", green to the "useful", blue to the "common", and violet to the "unnecessary".
These six qualities were assigned to four categories of human cognition, the rational (''Vernunft'') to the beautiful and the noble (red and orange), the intellectual (''Verstand'') to the good and the useful (yellow and green), the sensual (''Sinnlichkeit'') to the useful and the common (green and blue) and, closing the circle, imagination (''Phantasie'') to both the unnecessary and the beautiful (purple and red).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~mmandel/recherche/goethe_farbenkreis.html Goethe: Farbenkreis zur Symbolisierung des "menschlichen Geistes- und Seelenlebens". 1809] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603092523/http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~mmandel/recherche/goethe_farbenkreis.html |date=2011-06-03 }}.

Im inneren Ring: rot – 'schön', gelbrot – 'edel', gelb – 'gut', grün – 'nützlich', blau – 'gemein', blaurot – 'unnöthig'." (''"Each colour, a human quality is attributed to [...]. In the inner ring: red – 'beautiful', orange – 'noble', yellow – 'good', green – 'useful', blue – 'mean', violet – 'unnecessary'."'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notes on translation ====

[[Magenta]] appeared as a colour term only in the mid-nineteenth&amp;nbsp;century, after Goethe. Hence, references to Goethe's recognition of ''magenta'' are fraught with interpretation. If one observes the colours coming out of a prism—an English person may be more inclined to describe as magenta what in German is called ''Purpur''—so one may not lose the intention of the author.

However, literal translation is more difficult. Goethe's work uses two composite words for [[color mixing|mixed]] (intermediate) [[hue]]s along with corresponding usual [[color term|colour terms]] such as "orange" and "violet".

It is not clear how Goethe's ''Rot'', ''Purpur'' (explicitly named as the [[complementary colors|complementary]] to green),&lt;ref name="Physiologische Farben"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goethe |first=Johann Wolfgang von |authorlink=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe |title=Zur Farbenlehre |trans-title=Theory of Colours |accessdate=2013-01-21 |year=1810 |publisher= |location= |language=German |isbn= |chapter=1.&amp;nbsp;Abteilung.

Also, ''Purpur'' is certainly distinct from ''Blaurot'', because ''Purpur'' is named as a colour which lies somewhere between ''Blaurot'' and ''Gelbrot'' (,&lt;ref name="Epoptische Farben" /&gt; paragraph&amp;nbsp;476), although possibly not adjacent to the latter. This article uses the English translations from the above table.

== Newton and Goethe ==

"The essential difference between Goethe’s theory of colour and the theory which has prevailed in science (despite all modifications) since Newton’s day, lies in this: While the theory of Newton and his successors was based on excluding the colour-seeing faculty of the eye, Goethe founded his theory on the eye’s experience of colour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://borderlandresearch.com/book/man-or-matter/chapter-xiv-colours-as-deeds-and-sufferings-of-light Ernst Lehrs, Man or Matter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110234319/http://borderlandresearch.com/book/man-or-matter/chapter-xiv-colours-as-deeds-and-sufferings-of-light |date=2014-01-10 }}, retrieved January 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"The renouncing of life and immediacy, which was the premise for the progress of natural science since Newton, formed the real basis for the bitter struggle which Goethe waged against the physical optics of Newton. It would be  superficial to dismiss this struggle as unimportant: there is much significance in one of the most outstanding men directing all his efforts to fighting against the development of Newtonian optics." ([[Werner Heisenberg]], during a speech celebrating Goethe's birthday)&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Lehrs, Man or Matter, Chapter II | https://archive.org/stream/manormatter05641gut/elmom10p#page/n23/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their different approaches to a common subject, many misunderstandings have arisen between Newton's mathematical understanding of optics, and Goethe's experiential approach.&lt;ref name=Stephenson&gt;R. H. Stephenson, ''Goethe's Conception of Knowledge and Science'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] understands white light to be composed of individual colours, and Goethe sees colour arising from the interaction of light and dark, they come to different conclusions on the question: is the optical spectrum a primary or a compound phenomenon?

For Newton, the prism is immaterial to the existence of colour, as all the colours already exist in white light, and the prism merely fans them out according to their refrangibility. Goethe sought to show that, as a turbid medium, the prism was an integral factor in the arising of colour.

Whereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that with a wider aperture, there was no spectrum. He saw only reddish-yellow edges and blue-cyan edges with white between them, and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap. For him, the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomena of colour arising from the interaction of light and dark edges.

Newton explains the appearance of white with colored edges by saying that due to the differing overall amount of refraction, the rays mix together to create a full white towards the centre, whereas the edges do not benefit from this full mixture and appear with greater red or blue components. For Newton's account of his experiments, see his ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704).&lt;ref&gt;''Opticks Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light, Also Two treatises of the Species and Magnitude of Curvilinear Figures'' (London, 1704) {{cite web |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=43 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008062012/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=43 |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe's [[Concretization|reification]] of darkness is rejected by modern physics. Both Newton and [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] defined darkness as an absence of light. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]] combined Newton's particle theory with Huygen's wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Physicists today attribute both a corpuscular and undulatory character to light—comprising the [[wave–particle duality]].

== History and influence ==

The first edition of the ''Farbenlehre'' was printed at the Cotta’schen Verlagsbuchhandlung on May 16, 1810, with 250 copies on grey paper and 500 copies on white paper. It contained three sections: i)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;didactic section in which Goethe presents his own observations, ii)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;polemic section in which he makes his case against Newton, and iii)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;historical section.

From its publication, the book was controversial for its stance against Newton. So much so, that when [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] translated the text into English in 1840, he omitted the content of Goethe's polemic against Newton.

{{quote|Significantly (and regrettably), only the 'Didactic' colour observations appear in Eastlake's translation. In his preface, Eastlake explains that he deleted the historical and entoptic parts of the book because they 'lacked scientific interest', and censored Goethe's polemic because the 'violence of his objections' against Newton would prevent readers from fairly judging Goethe's color observations.|Bruce MacEvoy| Handprint.com, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/goethe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531083426/http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/goethe.html |archivedate=2009-05-31 |df= }} | Bruce MacEvoy | Handprint.com | 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Influence on the arts ===

[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|right|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', 1839]]
Goethe was initially induced to occupy himself with the study of colour by the questions of [[hue]] in painting. "During his first journey to Italy (1786–88), he noticed that artists were able to enunciate rules for virtually all the elements of painting and drawing except color and coloring. In the years 1786–88, Goethe began investigating whether one could ascertain rules to govern the artistic use of color."&lt;ref name="SepperDennis"&gt;Sepper, Dennis L. | ''Goethe contra Newton: Polemics and the Project for a New Science of Color'' | Cambridge University Press | 2007 | {{ISBN|0-521-53132-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aim came to some fulfillment when several pictorial artists, above all [[Philipp Otto Runge]], took an interest in his colour studies.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;4: Briefe der Jahre 1821–1832 (''Letters of the years 1821–1832''). ''C.&amp;nbsp;H. Beck'' publishers, München 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;622. "Wie die Anfänge von Goethes Beschäftigung mit der Farbenlehre veranlaßt waren durch die Frage nach dem Kolorit in der Malerei (...), so war die Anteilnahme bildender Künstler an seinen Farbenstudien für Goethe eine hochwillkommene Bestätigung des von ihm Gewollten, wie er sie vor allem von Philipp Otto Runge erfahren hat." (''"As the beginnings of Goethe's occupation with the theory of colours were induced by the question of hue in painting [...], the interest of pictorial artists in his colour studyings was a highly welcome acknowledgement of what he wanted, for him, which he above all received from Philipp Otto Runge."'')&lt;/ref&gt; After being translated into English by [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] in 1840, the theory became widely adopted by the art world—especially among the [[Pre-Raphaelites]]. [[J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W.

=== Influence on Latin American flags ===
[[File:59 - Carthagène - Décembre 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Flag of Colombia]]
During a party in Weimar in the winter of 1785, Goethe had a late-night conversation with the South American revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]]. In a letter written to [[Semyon Vorontsov|Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov]] (1792), Miranda recounted how Goethe, fascinated with his exploits throughout the Americas and Europe, told him, "Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:
{{cquote|First he explained to me the way the iris transforms the light into the three primary colours... then he said, "Why yellow is the most warm, noble and closest to the bright light; why Blue is that mix of excitement and serenity, so far that it evokes the shadows; and why Red is the exaltation of Yellow and Blue, the synthesis, the vanishing of the bright light into the shadows".&lt;ref&gt;Serpa Erazo, Jorge,  ''Pañol de la Historia''.

=== Influence on philosophers ===
In the nineteenth century Goethe's Theory was taken up by Schopenhauer in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', who developed it into a kind of arithmetical physiology of the action of the retina, much in keeping with his own representative realism.

In the twentieth century the theory was transmitted to philosophy via Wittgenstein, who devoted a series of remarks to the subject at the end of his life. These remarks are collected as ''Remarks on Colour'', (Wittgenstein, 1977).

{{quote|Someone who agrees with Goethe finds that Goethe correctly recognized the nature of colour.  And here ‘nature’ does not mean a sum of experiences with respect to colours, but it is to be found in the concept of colour. |Aphorism 125, Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Remarks on Color'', 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homodiscens.com/home/ways/perspicax/color_vision_sub/art_color_theory/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213045931/http://www.homodiscens.com/home/ways/perspicax/color_vision_sub/art_color_theory/ |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }} | Ludwig Wittgenstein | University of California Press | 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori, but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, Wittgenstein took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there ''are'' phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the "Farbenlehre", e.g. "White is the lightest colour", "There cannot be a transparent white", "There cannot be a reddish green", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, has been discussed in Jonathan Westphal's ''Colour: a Philosophical Introduction'' (Westphal, 1991).

=== Reception by scientists ===

As early as 1853, in [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s lecture on Goethe's scientific works—he says of Goethe's work that he depicts the perceived phenomena—"circumstantially, rigorously true to nature, and vividly puts them in an order that is pleasant to survey, and proves himself here, as everywhere in the realm of the factual, to be the great master of exposition" (Helmholtz 1853). Helmholtz ultimately rejects Goethe's theory as the work of a poet, but expresses his perplexity at how they can be in such agreement about the facts of the matter, but in violent contradiction about their meaning—'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, Hermann von. 1853. Goethes Vorahnungen kommender naturwissenschaftlicher Ideen. Berlin: Pastel. 1971. Philosophische Vortrdge und Aufsdtze. Ed. H. Horz and S. Wollgast. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] was the only prominent scientist among Goethe's contemporaries who acknowledged the theory, but later also saw it critically.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805–1821 (''Letters of the years 1805–1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;623. "[Seebeck] ist unter den Zeitgenossen der einzige profilierte Naturwissenschaftler, der Goethes ''Farbenlehre'' anerkannte, wenn er sie auch in den letzten Jahren dann kritisch sah." (''"[Seebeck] is the only prominent scientist among the contemporaries who acknowledged Goethe's ''Theory of Colours'', although in his latter years he also saw it critically."'')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"One hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour, through which he incessantly worried the Englishman with his lance. Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by [[John Dollond|Dollond]] to be wrong... Here, as elsewhere, Goethe proves himself master of the experimental conditions.

Much controversy stems from two different ways of investigating light and colour. Goethe was not interested in Newton's analytic treatment of colour—but he presented an excellent ''rational description'' of the phenomenon of human colour perception. It is as such a collection of colour observations that we must view this book.

{{quote|Most of Goethe's explanations of color have been thoroughly demolished, but no criticism has been leveled at his reports of the facts to be observed; nor should any be. This book can lead the reader through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors (after images, light and dark adaptation, irradiation, colored shadows, and pressure phosphenes), but also in physical phenomena detectable qualitatively by observation of color (absorption, scattering, refraction, diffraction, polarization, and interference). A reader who attempts to follow the logic of Goethe's explanations and who attempts to compare them with the currently accepted views might, even with the advantage of 1970 sophistication, become convinced that Goethe's theory, or at least a part of it, has been dismissed too quickly.|[[Deane B.

[[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] came to believe that "Goethe had been right about colour!"&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle" /&gt;

{{quote|As Feigenbaum understood them, Goethe's ideas had true science in them. They were hard and empirical. Over and over again, Goethe emphasized the repeatability of his experiments. It was the perception of colour, to Goethe, that was universal and objective.

"Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well.. a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments for [[Underdetermination]]."&lt;ref name="Mueller 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09608788.2015.1132671 |title=Prismatic Equivalence – A New Case of Underdetermination: Goethe vs. Newton on the Prism Experiments |journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=323–347 |year=2016 |last1=Mueller |first1=Olaf L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Goethe’s critique of Newton was not an attack on reason or science, though it has often been portrayed that way.. The critique maintained that Newton had mistaken mathematical imagining as the pure evidence of the senses.. Goethe tried to define the scientific function of imagination: to interrelate phenomena once they have been meticulously produced, described, and organized... Newton had introduced dogma.. into color science by claiming that color could be reduced to a function of rays." (Dennis L. Sepper, 2009)&lt;ref name="Sepper 2009"/&gt;
{{quote|Goethe started out by accepting Newton's physical theory. He soon abandoned it... finding modification to be more in keeping with his own insights. One beneficial consequence of this was that he developed an awareness of the importance of the physiological aspect of colour perception, and was therefore able to demonstrate that Newton's theory of light and colours is too simplistic; that there is more to colour than variable refrangibility.|Michael Duck, 1988&lt;ref name="Duck, Michael"&gt;{{cite web | last = Duck | first = Michael | title = Newton and Goethe on colour: Physical and physiological considerations | website =  | publisher = Annals of Science, Volume 45, Number 5, pp. 507-519 | date = September 1988 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tasc/1988/00000045/00000005/art00004?crawler=true | accessdate = 2011-03-29 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606080032/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tasc/1988/00000045/00000005/art00004?crawler=true | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Although he soon rejected Newton’s differential refrangibility, Goethe always affirmed Newtonian mechanics. It was not an apriori poetic prejudice against mathematical analysis but rather performing the experiments that led him to reject the theory... Goethe soon concluded that in order to explain color one needs to know not just about light but also about eye function and relative differences in light across the visual field." (Sepper, 2009)&lt;ref name="Sepper 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sepper | first = Dennis L. | title = Goethe, Newton, and the Imagination of Modern Science, 2009/3 (n° 249) | publisher = Revue internationale de philosophie | date = 2009 | url = https://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-philosophie-2009-3-page-261.htm | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160402180713/http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-philosophie-2009-3-page-261.htm | archivedate = 2016-04-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a catalogue of observations, Goethe's experiments probe the complexities of human colour perception. Whereas Newton sought to develop a mathematical model for the behaviour of light, Goethe focused on exploring how colour is perceived in a wide array of conditions. Developments in understanding how the brain interprets colours, such as [[Color constancy|colour constancy]] and [[Edwin H. Land]]'s [[Color constancy#Retinex theory|retinex]] theory bear striking similarities to Goethe's theory.&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle" /&gt;

A modern treatment of the book is given by Dennis L. Sepper in the book, ''Goethe contra Newton: Polemics and the Project for a New Science of Color'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;ref name="SepperDennis" /&gt;

{{quote|As to what I have done as a poet... I take no pride in it... but that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours—of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.| Goethe, as recalled by [[Johann Eckermann]]|''[[Conversations of Goethe]]'', (tr. [[John Oxenford]]), London, 1930, p.302}}

{{quote|[Goethe] delivered in full measure what was promised by the title of his excellent work: data toward a theory of colour. They are important, complete, and significant data, rich material for a future theory of colour. He has not, however, undertaken to furnish the theory itself; hence, as he himself remarks and admits on page xxxix of the introduction, he has not furnished us with a real explanation of the essential nature of colour, but really postulates it as a phenomenon, and merely tells us how it originates, not what it is.|[[Schopenhauer]]|''On Vision and Colors''}}

{{quote|Goethe's theory of the origin of the spectrum ''isn't'' a theory of its origin that has proved unsatisfactory; it is really not a theory at all. ''Nothing'' can be predicted by means of it. It is, rather, a vague schematic outline, of the sort we find in [[William James|James's]] psychology. There is no ''experimentum crucis'' for Goethe's theory of colour.|[[Wittgenstein]]|''Remarks on Colour''}}

{{quote|Can you lend me the ''Theory of Colours'' for a few weeks? It is an important work. His last things are insipid.|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]|''Conversation-book'', 1820}}

{{quote|
Should your glance on mornings lovely&lt;br /&gt;
Lift to drink the heaven's blue&lt;br /&gt;
Or when sun, veiled by sirocco,&lt;br /&gt;
Royal red sinks out of view –&lt;br /&gt;
Give to Nature praise and honor.&lt;br /&gt;
Blithe of heart and sound of eye,&lt;br /&gt;
Knowing for the world of colour&lt;br /&gt;

=== On the catalytic moment ===
{{quote|Aber wie verwundert war ich, als die durch's Prisma angeschaute weiße Wand nach wie vor weiß blieb, daß nur da, wo ein Dunkles dran stieß, sich eine mehr oder weniger entschiedene Farbe zeigte, daß zuletzt die Fensterstäbe am allerlebhaftesten farbig erschienen, indessen am lichtgrauen Himmel draußen keine Spur von Färbung zu sehen war. Es bedurfte keiner langen Überlegung, so erkannte ich, daß eine Gränze nothwendig sey, um Farben hervorzubringen, und ich sprach wie durch einen Instinct sogleich vor mich laut aus, daß die Newtonische Lehre falsch sey.

''But I was astonished, as I looked at a white wall through the prism, how it stayed white! That only there where it came upon some darkened area, it showed more or less some colour, then at last, around the window bars all the colours shone, whereas in the light grey sky outside there was no colour to be seen. It didn't take long before I knew that a border was required for colour to be brought forth, and I spoke as through an instinct out loud, that the Newtonian teachings were false.'' &lt;!--[rough translation by user: johnrpenner]--&gt;
