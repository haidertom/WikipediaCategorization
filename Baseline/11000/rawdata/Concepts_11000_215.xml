{{DISPLAYTITLE:"''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''" trial in Russia}}
[[Image:Bhagavad-Gita As It Is (Russian).jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Color image of the Russian edition of Bhagavad Gita As It Is front cover|The Russian edition of ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'', which was put on trial in [[Tomsk]].]]
The '''''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''''' '''trial in Russia''' was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book, ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'' (1968), a translation and commentary of the [[Hindu]] holy text, ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', on charges of [[religious extremism]]. It contains a translation and commentary by [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.

The trial was initiated in June 2011 in [[Tomsk, Russia]], based on an assessment of the book by scholars of [[Tomsk State University]], which concluded that Prabhupada's translations and commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as "patently absurd" undertaking of "ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Premier [[Vladimir Putin]] for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for [[India-Russia relations]] and for Russia's international reputation.

In December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was included in the 2011 annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]]  of the [[U.S. Department of State]] among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.

The court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' commissioned by the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]].&lt;ref name=US-DS /&gt; Its authors, three professors of [[Tomsk State University]],  Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]]'s commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' contain "signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction",&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest&gt;{{Cite web|title=Перевод священного писания кришнаитов проверят на экстремизм|trans-title=Translation of the sacred Krishna scriptures to be tried for extremism|url=http://www.ria.ru/inquest/20110831/427685043.html|author=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; and foster "social discord", "gender, race, nationality, and language" discrimination.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; In addition to this, it was alleged to contain "calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups".&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Первый зам генпрокурора, высказавшийся по суду над "Бхагавад-гитой", недостаточно информирован, считают юристы, участвовавшие в процессе|trans-title=Lawyers: First Deputy Prosecutor General insufficiently informed to comment on the trial of the "Bhagavad-gita"|url=http://www.newsru.com/religy/17feb2012/bhagavad.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=17 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-tomsk&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска подала апелляцию на решение суда о "Бхагавад-гите"|trans-title=The Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal of Tomsk court's decision on the "Bhagavad Gita"|url=http://newsru.com/religy/26jan2012/tomsk.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=26 January 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска настаивает на экстремистском характере "Бхагавад-гиты" и подала апелляцию|trans-title=The prosecutor's office in Tomsk insists on an extremist nature "Bhagavad Gita" and filed an appeal"|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2012/01/26/n_2180377.shtml|newspaper=[[Gazeta.ru]]|date=January 26, 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First, second, and third hearings (August 2011)===

In the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt; According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security]] officer Dmitry Velikotsky.&lt;ref name=F18&gt;{{cite news|last=Corley|first=Felix|title=RUSSIA: Has "madness" of banning religious publications been stopped?|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1652|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[Forum 18]]|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite news|last=Попова|first=Анна|title=На поле дхармы|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/12/21/bhagavadgita/|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' did not contain any extremist statements.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the [[Bible]], like: "Don't throw [[wikt:cast pearls before swine|pearls before swine]]".&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

The judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of [[Kemerovo State University]], including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov.&lt;ref name=lenta /&gt; They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not.&lt;ref name=F18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS&gt;{{cite news|author=[[ITAR-TASS]]|script-title=ru:Томский суд отказался признать "Бхагавад-гиту" экстремистской|trans-title=Tomsk court refused to recognize the "Bhagavad Gita" as extremist|date=28 December 2011|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/c9/308329.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.&lt;ref name=TOI-SPD&gt;{{cite news|title=As Hindus rally, Russia court defers Gita verdict|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111230042909/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2011|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=20 December 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal (March 2012)===
On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned,&lt;ref name=TOI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/europe/30666187_1_gita-verdict-social-discord-and-hatred-appeal|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-APP&gt;{{cite news |title=Ban Only Russian Comment in Hindu Holy Book – Prosecutors |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120216/171341942.html |accessdate=16 February 2012 |date=16 February 2012 |agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asking for more time.&lt;ref name=ET-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian prosecutors to move higher court seeking Gita ban |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/russian-prosecutors-to-move-higher-court-seeking-gita-ban/articleshow/11640077.cms|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=26 January 2012}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as "extremist literature."&lt;ref name=firstpost1&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/gita-verdict-russian-prosecutors-planning-to-file-appeal-194858.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The First Post]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and "semantic distortions."&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt;

The prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, "When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond".&lt;ref name=RASPI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor's office appeals adverse judgment in Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120126/259796779.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=1 February 2012|agency=RASPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal in Bhagavad Gita case to be heard in March|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120214/260191734.html|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=RAPSI (Russian Legal Information Agency)|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later rescheduled for March 20.&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

On February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, "it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason." Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, "That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court".&lt;ref name=RIA-APP /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-proc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/religy/16feb2012/bhagavad.html|script-title=ru:В Генпрокуратуре считают, что дело "Бхагавад-гиты" представляется в обществе искаженно|trans-title=The prosecutor's office believes that the "Bhagavad Gita" case is distorted in the community|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=16 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the [[Interfax]] office in Tomsk, [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult]] activist [[Alexander Dvorkin]] stated that the "manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors' complaints in Bhagavad Gita book case legitimate – expert|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9088|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the appeal, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), along with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), stated that they would fight "internationally" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Iskcon to fight against ban attempt on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-23/bhubaneswar/31090291_1_bhagavad-gita-ban-attempts|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dismissal of appeal (March 2012)===
Representative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of "extremism" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred.&lt;ref name=Echo-Moskvy&gt;{{cite news|title=Томский суд вновь отказал прокуратуре в запрете книги "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[Echo Moskvy]]|url=http://echo.msk.ru/news/870830-echo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Суд в Томске вновь отказался признать экстремистской книгу "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[NEWSru]]|url=http://newsru.com/religy/21mar2012/bhagavad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition.&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS-2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDTVxx&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian court dismisses plea seeking ban on Gita|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/russian-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-ban-on-gita-188254|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=21 March 2012|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' extremist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors won't contest court refusal to declare 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' extremist|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120529/263289348.html|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Russian Legal Information Agency|date=29 May 2012|agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, [[Sushma Swaraj]], leader of the largest opposition party [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] demanded that the Indian government declare the ''Bhagavad Gita'' a "national book".&lt;ref name=HT-NB&gt;{{cite news|title=Declare Bhagavad Gita as national book, demands BJP|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220143222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, [[Tarun Vijay]], who asked rhetorically  "Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?"&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; Members across party lines voiced their support.&lt;ref name=HT-NB/&gt;  [[Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha]] [[K.

On December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief [[Vijay Jolly]] met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's "pain and anguish" at the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial and demand that "suitable measures" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that "[[India–Russia relations]] is of paramount importance to both countries". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy  a copy of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' to [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of "sublime thoughts" that "preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties".&lt;ref name=Outlook-BJP&gt;{{cite news|title=Take Steps to Withdraw Gita Case: BJP to Russia|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616082341/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|archive-date=16 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in [[Kolkata]], holding up copies of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|last=Prusty|first=Nigam|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/uk-india-russia-idUKTRE7BI0W620111219|title=Hold India uproar at call in Russia to ban Hindu holy book|work=[[Reuters]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protest marches were held in [[New Delhi]]&lt;ref name=HT-GKG&gt;{{cite news|last=Arora|first=Rajat|title=ISKCON: If Gita is banned, we’ll intensify protest|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=20 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221010708/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|archive-date=21 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Chandigarh]].&lt;ref name=TOI-On&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/chandigarh/30537527_1_bhagawad-gita-signatures-petition|title=Bhagawad Gita on trial gathers online support|last=Negi|first=Himanshi|date=December 20, 2011|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]], ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]]er for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, "I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court".&lt;ref name=HT-GKG /&gt;

On December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he  condemned  "Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Manjari|title=Darul Uloom Deoband urges Hindus, Muslims to unite on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/india/30546086_1_darul-uloom-deoband-hindus-muslims|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism "totally baseless and highly objectionable",&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt; maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience "enshrined" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the "Russian highhandedness".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;
Maulana Khalid Rashid,  head of [[Firangi Mahal]], another Islamic center of higher education in [[Lucknow]],  also condemned what he called "Russian arrogance" and called on Muslims to support  Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government "to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;

On December 22, 2011,  [[Isai Mahasangh]] organization representing  Christians in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] addressed the [[President of India]] [[Pratibha Patil]] and the [[Pope Benedict XVI]], asking for their intervention in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor [[Ram Naresh Yadav]], and to the Pope through the [[Holy See]] embassy in [[New Delhi]]. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that  "the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians".&lt;ref name=Hindu-Chr&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Mahim Pratap|title=Christians in MP oppose proposed Russian ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2738302.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent Hindu teacher [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]] in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia "an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia" and, countering accusations of the book of "extremism" and "intolerance"  opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings.&lt;ref name=DB-NET&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita ban: Outrage grows as sales soar|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/NAT-TOP-bhagvad-gita-ban-outrage-grows-as-sales-soar-2660886.html?HT4=|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu activists====
On December 20, 2011, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)]] threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary [[Pravin Togadia]] said in a statement that the ''Bhagavad Gita'' is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and "touch humanity so very deeply", citing [[Albert Einstein]]'s fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia.&lt;ref name=AA-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP threatens Russian establishments with retaliation if Gita is banned|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/vhp-threatens-russian-establishments-retaliation-if-gita-banned-632|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Asian Age]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the [[Russian consulate in Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Kates|first=Glenn|title=In Russia, the Bhagavad Gita has a date in court|url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/in-russia-the-bhagavad-gita-has-a-date-in-court/|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VHP and [[Bajrang Dal]] activists also staged protest in [[Chandigarh]], calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of [[Hindus in Russia]] and denouncing the proposed ban.&lt;ref name=DB-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Bajrang Dal protest against bid to ban Bhagwad Gita|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/PUN-NEWS-vhp-bajrang-dal-protest-against-bid-to-ban-bhagwad-gita-2657671.html?LHS-|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, dozens of activists of [[Rashtrawadi Sena]], a hardline Hindu group,  burned a [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in [[New Delhi]] over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the ''Gita'' "the most pious book of the nation" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the ''Bhagavad Gita''  a "national scripture" in order to prevent such insults in the future.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion or extremism?

====Atheists and rationalists====
[[Sanal Edamaruku]], the president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the [[Tarksheel Society]], also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.&lt;ref name=atheist/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Dalit]] [[Marxist]] scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.&lt;ref name=atheist&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheists, rationalists oppose ban on Bhagwat Gita|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-12-23/news/30550973_1_ban-iskon-bhagwat-gita|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian community in Goa====

On December 21, 2011,  the Russian community in [[Goa]] has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa [[Vikram Varma]] stated: "The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians in Goa flay possibility of ban on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/goa/30545829_1_russian-consulate-russian-city-goa|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Society====
The trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from  all over the world, mostly from India.&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;

The topic has gone viral on social networks, with the [[hashtag]] #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; Noted poet and lyricist [[Javed Akhtar]], for instance, twitted: "Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;&lt;ref name=Link&gt;{{cite news|title=Should Bhagavad Gita be India’s National Book?|url=http://thelinkpaper.ca/?p=12828|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=The Link|date=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member of Parilament [[Naveen Jindal]] wrote in his blog, "I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the ''Bhagavad Gita'' controversy".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; [[Janata Dal]] party leader [[Subramanian Swamy]] wrote on Twitter: "Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?"&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; and  Bollywood celebrity [[Farah Khan]] suggested in a retweet: "The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;

Prominent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3&gt;{{cite news|last=Nanjappa|first=Vicky|title=Bhagavad Gita ban:Three views, three solutions|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-debate-bhagavad-gita-ban/20111223.htm|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Rediff News|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A vocal anti-fundamentalist [[Ram Puniyani]] of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita'' translation "irrational",&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;  Former president of the [[Students Islamic Movement of India]] Shahid Badr Falahi said he was "completely against"&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; this or any other bans of religious books, calling on  "equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; [[Ram Madhav]], national executive member of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]  termed the attempted ban "a shameful act"  planned by some "fundamentalist groups in Russia" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a "terror manual".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;

===In Russia===
The Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like "Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

====Indian diaspora and ISKCON====
Hare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; On November 1, ISKCON leader in India [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]] appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;  Hindu followers in Russia from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nepal]] and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the [[Hindu Council of Russia]] meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected [[Sadhu Priya Das]], and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman.  Das said that  they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that "finally the truth will prevail".&lt;ref name=STAT-BAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Statesman /&gt;

ISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTx/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNLx /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-reject&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court rejects bid to ban "Bhagavad-Gita"|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/28/tomsk_court_rejects_the_bid_to_ban_bhagavad-gita_14108.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-bilateral&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita in court: Overcoming unexpected roadblock to relationship|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/10/bhagavad_gita_in_court_overcoming_unexpected_roadblock_to_bilateral_14141.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholars====
[[Islamic studies]] scholar [[Roman Silantyev]] opined that  Prabhupada's interpretation "has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.&lt;ref name=Interfax-MID&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper&amp;nbsp;– ministry|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8941|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=23 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'', scientists and members of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, "there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations."&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

Sergey Serebryanny, the head of the [[Institute of High Humanitarian Studies]] at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers "have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation".&lt;ref name=RT /&gt;

Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the ''Bhagavad Gita'', which "is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was "admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, "nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism  against Prabhupada's "copious" commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are fallacious and based on a "primitive" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as "fool," "enemy," "demon, "kill"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when  "specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards "a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy  book to ''Mein Kampf'', should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, "people will again start being burned alive".&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

Historian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the ''Gita'' was "contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, "one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' Volodin replied that "all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world".&lt;ref name=RIR-Volodin&gt;{{cite news|last=Volodin|first=Andrei|title=Gita row: A test of Russian toleration|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/gita_row_a_test_of_russian_toleration_14077.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government====
In an interview by ''[[CNN-IBN]]'', Russia's ambassador to India [[Alexander Kadakin]] called ''Bhagavad Gita'' "the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world."

He assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the ''Bhagavad Gita'' scandal and added that he thought it "categorically inadmissible" to take any sacred scriptures "for examination to ignorant people" to the courts  rather than to academic forums&lt;ref name=IE-RU&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia expresses sadness over Bhagwad Gita controversy|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/russia-expresses-sadness-over-bhagwad-gita-controversy/889960/0|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=KadTOI /&gt; Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still "can do something" and called the instigators of the trial "madmen", whose "madness should be stopped."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it "has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;

On December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban.&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK&gt;{{cite news|title=Krishna discusses Bhagavad Gita row with Russian ambassador|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-27/india/30560871_1_court-in-tomsk-city-bhagavad-gita-nerpa|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 December 2011|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia "to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that "no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court".&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK /&gt;

According to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also "expressed regrets" about the situation.&lt;ref name=Hindu-LS /&gt;

Russian [[Ombudsman|Chief Director]] for [[Human rights in Russia|Human Rights]] [[Vladimir Lukin]] stated that the attempt to ban ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' amounted to "infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness"&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=India asks Russia to drop the case against Gita translation|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2731900.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was "unacceptable" to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a "globally respected book".&lt;ref name=Statesman&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita ban: Russian court suspends verdict till 28 Dec|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108011714/http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|archivedate=8 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.&lt;ref name=TheHindu-MID&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Gita ban: Russia rejects India's complaints|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2741599.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a December 22, 2011 press briefing, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]] spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: "In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The work represents an authorized translation of the original from Sanskrit into English. The book was translated into Russian in 1984. As evident from the materials available, the complaints of law enforcement are not so much about the text of the book itself, whose double translation suffers from semantic distortions, as about the author's comments which were regarded as falling under Article 13 of the Federal Law 'On Counteracting Extremist Activity'."&lt;ref name=Interfax-MID /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Interfax&gt;{{cite news|author=Interfax|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper - ministry|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/tomsk_trial_held_over_bhagavad_gita_translation_not_book_proper_-_mi_14078.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheHindu-MID /&gt;&lt;ref name=MID-brief&gt;{{cite press release |script-title=ru:Брифинг официального представителя МИД России А.К.Лукашевича, 22 декабря 2011 года|trans-title=Briefing by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mr. Lukashevitch, December 22, 2011|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Foreign Ministry]]|date=22 December 2011|url=http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/briefview/5A299EC9BE98767A4425796E005447BD|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial "absurd". Speaking on the ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'' radio station, she said, "This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years."  She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to "violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith." &lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

The court case  evoked protests by US-based [[Hindu]] activists, who called the trial "an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire [[Hindu]] community."&lt;ref name=YahooNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/hindus-upset-bhagavad-gita-ban-attempt-russian-city-095924009.html|title=Hindus upset at Bhagavad Gita ban attempt by Russian city|work= [[Asian News International|ANI]]|publisher = [[Yahoo!

Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors "indefensible" and "a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia".
Shukla added that, "[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society".&lt;ref name=HAF /&gt; HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government "to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens". They also warned that "Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world".&lt;ref name=HAF&gt;{{cite news|last=Jha|first=Lalit K.|title=Hindus in US outraged at attempts to ban Gita in Russia|url=http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5694646|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=[[MSN News]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, [[Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal]], condemned the proposed ban, urging the [[Politics of Nepal|government]] and the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Parliament]] to support the ''Bhagavad Gita''. Chairman of the Dharma Sabha [[Madhav Bhattarai]] also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal.&lt;ref name=HimTimes1&gt;{{cite news|title=Dharma Sabha Nepal denounces ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Dharma+Sabha+Nepal+denounces+ban+on+Gita&amp;NewsID=313585|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the ''Gita'' "guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban.&lt;ref name=HimTimes2&gt;{{cite news|title='Bhagwat Gita is not extremist literature'|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline='Bhagwat+Gita+is+not+extremist+literature'&amp;NewsID=313597&amp;a=3|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] in its annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]] for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of  "selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom" by the Russian government. The report quoted the Russian Ombudsperson for Human Rights Vladimil Lukin as saying that  "the struggle with terrorism is a struggle with real terrorist planning and creation of groups, not with the interpretation of ancient holy books, of whatever faith".&lt;ref name=US-DS&gt;{{cite web|last=[[United States Department of State]]|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2011|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193067.pdf|publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholars===
{{Wikinews|Russian scholars call on Medvedev and Putin to defend Bhagavad Gita}}
On February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference ''Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society'' at the Tomsk State University.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita case perplex scientists|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120224/260445972.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=RAPSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said they were "perplexed" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the ''Bhagavad Gita as It Is'' declared extremist. [[Chief researcher]] of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], indologist [[Irina Glushkova]] said in an interview with ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' that there are various schools of Hinduism "and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary", adding that "from this point of view ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office".&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt; She also stated it was "impermissible" to subject the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' to a criminal court trial, because "it is inseparable from the original ''Bhagavad Gita'', both being parts of the same culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Рассматривать "Бхагавад-гиту как она есть" с точки зрения Уголовного кодекса - недопустимо, утверждают ученые|trans-title=Scholars: It's impermissible to view the Bhagavad Gita As It Is via the Criminal Code|url=http://www.interfax-russia.ru/Siberia/report.asp?id=295556|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosopher [[Tatyana Lyubimova]], chief researcher of the [[Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], said that most ancient scriptures, including the ''Bhagavad Gita'', were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

On March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[Oriental studies|orientologists]], and [[philology|philologists]] published an open letter addressing both [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] and [[President-elect]] [[Vladimir Putin]], with copies sent to Russia's [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Presecutor General]], [[Ministry of Justice of Russia|Ministry of Justice]], and [[Public Chamber]], urging the ruling tandem to take the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' court case under their "personal control".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Russian scholars' plea on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2999643.ece|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 March 2012|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsru-20&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Российские ученые просят Медведева и Путина взять процесс над "Бхагавад-гитой" под личный контроль|trans-title=Russian scholars ask Medvedev and Putin to take "Bhagavad Gita" court case under their personal control|url=http://newsru.com/religy/15mar2012/bhagavad.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=15 March 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as "untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Bengali Vaishnavism]], "one of the most popular branches of Hinduism",&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; and "did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial "discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

===ISKCON===
Maxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]], said that the commentary to ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' is "a precise and clear reflection" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-[[acharya]] of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us", said [[Ajai Malhotra]], Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name=RIR-Mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court dismisses Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/03/21/tomsk_court_dismisses_bhagavad_gita_case_15204.html|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible.

{{expand section|date=April 2012}}
On April 11, 2012 [[Vladimir Lukin]], the [[Human Rights]] [[Commissioner]] of Russia, "warned against court decisions on ''Bhagavad Gita'' texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations." Lukin stated that the "Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to [[theologian]]s and [[historian]]s." Lukin noted that "[[Winston Churchill]] once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it."&lt;ref name=dailymail-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns Gita rulings should be up to experts|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2128403/Russian-ombudsman-warns-Gita-rulings-experts.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 April 2012|location=London|first=Dadan|last=Upadhyay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns on Gita rulings|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/russian-ombudsman-warns-on-gita-rulings/1/184131.html|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-Lukin&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita Texts Up for Experts to Judge - Russian Ombudsman|url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20120411/172744774.html|newspaper=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religions====
On December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council [[Roman Silantyev]] said that the examination of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' as extremist was accurate, and that "it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism."

He also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with "extremely nasty reputation" and condemned their [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|charitable food distribution programs]] saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.&lt;ref name=IFSil&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court didn't find "Bhagavad Gita" translation extremist|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8953|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=28 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a "destructive cult" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It''.  [[Mufti]] Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, 
"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to "pay the debt" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable  food distribution by "delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites".&lt;ref name=IF-Mus&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Muslims believe Krishnaites a sect and ready to deliver them Halal meat|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8986|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=18 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Siberian prosecutors make another attempt to ban Prabhupada’s Gita interpretation|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/26/siberian_prosecutors_make_another_attempt_to_ban_prabhupadas_gita_in_14630.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as "fortunately" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal /&gt;

On January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', which they called an "anti-Russian … disgraceful act" and "one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orthodox believers conveyed a batch of tinned stewed meat to Moscow Krishnaites in protest against burning Russian flag|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9015|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is "misinformed" and "exerting pressure" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because "there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet".&lt;ref name=IF-Bud&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:В буддийской общине РФ выступают против строительства храма кришнаитов в Москве|trans-title=The Buddhist community of Russia spoke against the construction of Krishna temple in Moscow|url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=44000|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=31 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Āśraya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: आश्रय) variously means – base, source, assistance, shelter, protection, refuge, dependence, having recourse to or depending on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AF&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Hindu philosophy]], the living entity or ''[[Jiva]]'' is ''āśraya'', and [[Brahman]] or the Supreme Being, the Godhead, is ''[[Visayah|viśaya]]'', the supreme objective, the goal of life [[Bhagavata Purana]] (VII.x.6). But, this word - ''āśraya'' conveying the primary meaning – 'refuge', immediately relates with the deity which is worshipped rather than with the abstract Brahman, the substratum of all that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ganesapurana|publisher=[[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]]|page=65|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WcKf113gPwwC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I2AKVfnpDMyzuASv9ICwBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu view-point==

[[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]], which promotes qualified-monism, holds the belief that ''[[Jiva]]'' is ''anu'' or [[Arity|monadic]] in substance. ''Jiva'' though infinitesimal, is the individual ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' harboured by a body, which ''atman'' the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] tells us, to be known by the mind is capable of becoming infinite through its attributive knowledge. ''Jiva'' is ''kartā'' and ''bhoktā'', both; it is the ''āśraya'' for ''jñāna'', the substrate for ''krti'' or ''[[prayatna]]'' (effort) caused by the desire to act. Therefore, ''Jiva'' is the ''āśraya'' for the states of experience that invariably involve changes in mental disposition without affecting the ''Jiva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vaisnavism: Its Philosophy..|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|pages=71–73|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=evmiLInyxBMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] does not consider ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidyā]]'' (ignorance) as something positively existent, he does not speak about its ''vikśepa-śakti'' (power of dispersion) or ''avarna-sakti'' (power of concealment); he does not raise ''avidyā'' to an eternal metaphysical entity. Shankara also does not subscribe to the view that the individual soul is the bearer of ''avidyā'' (āśraya) or to the contention that the [[Paramatman]] is the ''āśraya'' of ''avidyā'' as is held by [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Mandana]] and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vācaspati]]. He reiterates that for an awakened person there is no ''avidyā'' to delude and cause pain or pleasure. In the context of the origin of the world (the original state is called ''[[avyakta]]'') he terms Parameswara-Brahman as the āśraya of [[Namarupa|nāmarūpe]] (the physical presence which name manifests) and that Brahman is the āspada (locus) of the cosmic vyavahāra imagined by avidya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philology and Confrontation|author=Paul Hacker|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|pages=65, 66, 77|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uP9-Qme_Bo0C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge implies the subject which knows and the object that is known. Suppression (''[[avarna]]'') precedes substitution (''[[viksepa]]''); ''avidyā'' makes one misapprehend and therefore it is described as positive (''bhāva-rūpa''), and does not contradict ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyā]]'' (knowledge). With regard to the transmigrating souls, Shankara does speak about the ''bhūta- āśraya'' or elementary substratum or material substratum of the soul, the subtle body, and about the ''karma- āśraya'' or moral substratum connected with ''vāsanās'' (impressions), ''karma'' (works ordained or forbidden) and ''pūrvaprajñā'' (previous experience) but he does not accept the existence of subtle persisting elements of works or preparatory elements of fruits called ''[[apurva]]'' because of their non-spiritual nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Vedanta Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=43,300|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nzdbNqXIxQkC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NV8KVay6KIe4uATV5YHIAQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bhagavata Purana (one of the 18 Mahapuranas or 18 Major Puranas) the personal aspect of God is the Āśraya of the ātmā.

==Jaina viewpoint==

Condition of existence (''gati''), according to [[Jain philosophy]], is the state of a soul shaped by ''gati-nama-karma'' (body-condition-making) or is the cause of the soul passing through any one of the four conditions of existence – hellish, sub-human, human and celestial. They subscribe to the view that in a thing which is permanent the existence of ''sāmānaya'' and ''samavāya'' is complete, that means that common properties cannot exist without individuals possessing them; the individuals are the ''āśraya''; ''sāmānaya'' and ''samavāya'' is complete in one substance will not exist without ''āśraya'' (substratum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Apta-mimamsa of Acharya Samantabhadra|publisher=Bharatiya Jnanapith|pages=30|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KBbt-zzaKKEC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view-point==

[[Vasubandhu]] explains that the ''āśraya'' (foundation or support) of the fundamental change that indicates ''ātmabhāva'' (psychophysical continuum) is the non-conceptual wisdom free from the duality of the apprehender and the apprehended; ''āśraya'' refers to obscured ''tathagatagarbha'' (the fourth vajra-point) and its change (''tataparāvrtti'') which is enlightenment (the fifth vajra-point). It is possible to replace one ''āśraya'' with another by freeing the ''[[ayatana]]s'' (internal and external sense- bases) from physical and mental impregnations of negative tendencies which bring about craving, suffering etc., by cultivating calm abiding and superior insight, which process activates the''ayatanas'' associated with awareness (''vidyā'') that purify all impregnations of negative tendencies and involve raising oneself to ''śuddhāśrayabhūmi'', the level of pure superior intention, never to return to the lower realms or suffer rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining for Wisdom within Delusion|author=Karl Brunnholzl|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|page=|url= https://books.google.co.in/booksid=W1JbBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1l0KVaPkLdiLuATLtIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tathatā'' is the basis of transcendental wisdom, and ''Bhūtatathatā'' is the genuine 'Suchness', the essential nature of phenomenal existence, the self-identical universality, the grounding (''āśraya'') truth of finite particularity. The [[Buddhists]] believe that the ''skandhas'', the ''ayatanas'' and the ''[[Skandha#Eighteen Dh.C4.81tus|dhātu]]s'' are the ''dharmas'' that constitute the phenomenal world and are the forms (and the conditioning factors) in which consciousness appears to itself. ''Bhūtatathatā'' is the ''āśraya'' i.e. the basis which is to be transformed (''āśraya-paravritti''), and also the ''āśraya'' which is the result of the transformation. Therefore, it is the ''āśraya'' of delusion and awakening. The ''Mahāyāna-samparigrahaśāshtra'' tells us that the mind of Reality is ever obstructed by ''āveṇkī avidyā'' which is ''manas'', the seventh consciousness and the  ''āśraya'' of ''mano-vijñāna'' and the five sensorial consciousnesses evolved from self-patterning of the Absolute; the attachment of ''manas'' to ''ātmagrāha'' (egohood) and ''dharmagrāha'' (thinghood) makes the perception of the multiplicity of forms possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddha Nature|author=Brian Edward Brown|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=196, 217|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NV8KVay6KIe4uATV5YHIAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahāyāna-abhidharmasutra'' tells us that the beginningless ''dhātu'' (locus) is the equal support (''āśraya'') of all phenomena (''dharma'') and rests in the body as seeds. According to the [[Yogacara]]s, ''ātmabhāva'' and ''āśraya'' basically mean – "body", and who also tell us that ''āśraya-paravritti'' can be of the mind or path or errant tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pruning of the Bodhi Tree|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|pages=171, 196|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AjlCz4xm1gIC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fmEKVcCyE9GWuASIiYDIBA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Hindu astrology]]==

''Āśarya yoga'', a special kind of planetary placement with most planets resting in moveable or fixed or common signs (''rāsis''), is one of the thirty-two varieties of ''Nabhasa yogas'' in which regard [[Varahamihira]] tells us –

:  अनुष्टुभ्-आश्रयोक्तास्तु विफला भवन्त्यन्यैर्विमिश्रताः |
:  मिश्रा येस्ते फलं दद्युरमिश्राः स्वफलप्रदाः ||

: " The Āśarya yogas become ineffective, when they look like other yogas, and those other yogas become operative and bear results. When the Āśarya yogasdo not bear any resemblance with other yogas, it is then that the Āśarya yogas produce results. " – [[Brihat Jataka]] (XII.12)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brihajjatakam of Varahamihira|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=213|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KeS5VkbutFEC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=asraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I2AKVfnpDMyzuASv9ICwBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=asraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common technology and alternate fuel available in the market for bi-fuel gasoline cars is [[Liquefied petroleum gas|Autogas (LPG)]], followed by [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html | title=Natural Gas Vehicles | author=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center | publisher=US Department of Energy | date= | accessdate=2008-09-01 |language= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901201306/http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html| archivedate= 1 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used mainly in Europe. The Netherlands and the Baltic states have a large number of cars running with LPG. [[Italy]] currently has the largest number of CNG vehicles, followed by Sweden.  They are also used in [[South America]], where these vehicles are mainly used as [[taxicab]]s in main cities of [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the [[gas cylinder]] in the trunk and the LPG or CNG injection system and electronics.

==Diesel conversions==
Diesel engine is compression ignition engine and does not have spark plug. To operate a diesel engine with an alternate combustible fuel source such as [[Natural gas]], '''Dual-Fuel''' system used. Natural gas as the main fuel while [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] fuel is used for the ignition of the gas/air mixture inside the cylinder (a portion of diesel is injected at the end of the compression stroke, thereby maintaining the original diesel operation principle)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.uthm.edu.my/8473/|title=Conversion method of a diesel engine to a CNG-diesel dual fuel engine and its financial savings|last=Mukhsin|first=Ismail, Muammar|last2=Hakim|first2=Zulkifli, Abd Fathul|date=April 2016|website=eprints.uthm.edu.my|access-date=2018-08-20|last3=Fawzi|first3=Mohd Ali, Mas|last4=Azmir|first4=Osman, Shahrul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual fuel operation means the engine uses two fuels (gas and diesel)  at the same time, as opposed to Bi Fuel which would mean the engine could have the option of using either fuel separately.

There usually two type of conversions - low speed (below 1000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and high speed (between 1200 and 1800 RPM).

[[Image:Low speed conversion.jpg|thumb|Low Speed Conversion]]

===Low and middle speed conversion===
Gas is injected into the cylinder inlet manifold by individual gas electromagnetic valves installed as close to the suction valves as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the suction and exhaust valves (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines – within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.

* This conversion is adjusted for low speed engines up to 1000 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 70-90% natural gas for diesel or HFO.
* Gas is injected directly before intake valve by high speed electromagnetic injector, one or two injector per each cylinder.

=== High speed conversion===
[[Image:High speed conversion.jpg|thumb|High Speed Conversion]]

Gas is mixed with air by a common mixer installed before turbocharger(s). Gas flow is controlled by a throttle valve, which is electronically operated by the special control system according to the required engine output and speed. In order to avoid knocking of the engine, knocking detector/controller is installed, thus enabling engine operation at the most efficient gas/diesel ratio.

* Suitable for all High Speed engines, 1200-1800 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 50-80% natural gas for diesel.
* Gas and air are blended behind air filter before turbocharger by central mixer.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRwH9BF0h1w&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common conversion features==
{{prose|section|date=March 2017}}
* Substantial savings on operation costs
* Practically no engine modification required
* Non-derated output power
* Fuel flexibility: Possibility of bi-fuel or original pure diesel operations
* Safe operations.
* Lower emissions
* Longer engine life span, longer service and maintenance intervals

==Gas types used==
It is common to use [[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG (Liquid Natural Gas)]] for bi-fuel operations. Both are also mostly used for [[Electrical generator|Generator sets]] conversions, because the engine does not lose the output power.

In recent years [[biogas]] is being used. The [[biogas]] composition and calorific value must be known in order to evaluate if the particular biogas type is suitable. Calorific value may be an issue as biogas is derived from different sources and there is low calorific value in many cases. You can imagine you have to inject sufficient volume of gas into the cylinder to substitute [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] oil (or, better to say, substitute energy delivered by diesel oil). If the calorific value (energy) of the biogas was very low, there is a need to inject really big volume of biogas into the cylinder, which might be technically impossible. Additionally, the composition of the biogas has to lean towards ignitable gases and be filtered as much as possible of non-combustible compounds such as carbon dioxide.

Associated gas is the last type of gas which is commonly used for bi-fuel conversions of generator sets. Associated gas is a natural gas found in association with oil, either dissolved in the oil or as a cap of free gas above the oil. It means it has almost the same quality as CNG or LNG.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/halliburton-leads-effort-_n_3342119.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diesel/gas ratio==
It depends on the technical state of the engine, especially of the injection system. The typical Diesel / Gas ratio is 40/60% for the high-speed engines. If the operating output of the engine is constant and between 70-80% of nominal output, than it is possible to reach up to 30/70% ratio.&lt;ref&gt;http://hhpinsight.com/epoperations/2013/02/cummins-for-pge-universal-fracking/&lt;/ref&gt; If the operating output is lower (for example 50% of the nominal output) or if there are variations, the rate is about 45/55% (more of diesel is used).For Low Speed conversions it is possible to reach the Diesel/gas ratio up to 10/90%. Generally, it is not possible to guarantee an exact diesel/gas ratio without a test being done after the conversion.

== Vehicles ==
[[Aftermarket (automotive)|Aftermarket]] 'bi-fuel' and even 'tri-fuel' conversions are also available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5624">[[Image:Windows 2000 architecture.png|thumb|An example block diagram, showing the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 2000]] [[operating system]] architecture.]]

A '''block diagram''' is a [[diagram]] of a [[system]] in which the principal parts or functions are represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships of the blocks.&lt;ref name ="SSEV"&gt;[http://pascal.computer.org/sev_display/index.action SEVOCAB: Software and Systems Engineering Vocabulary]. Term: ''block diagram''. retrieved 31 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They are heavily used in engineering in [[Hardware architecture|hardware design]], [[electronic design]], [[software design]], and [[process flow diagram]]s.

Block diagrams are typically used for higher level, less detailed descriptions that are intended to clarify overall concepts without concern for the details of implementation. Contrast this with the [[schematic diagram]]s and [[integrated circuit layout|layout diagram]]s used in electrical engineering, which show the implementation details of electrical components and physical construction.

== Usage ==
As an example, a block diagram of a [[radio]] is not expected to show each and every connection and dial and switch, but the schematic diagram is. The schematic diagram of a radio does not show the width of each connection in the [[printed circuit board]], but the layout does.

To make an analogy to the map making world, a block diagram is similar to a highway map of an entire nation.  The major cities (functions) are listed but the minor county roads and city streets are not. When troubleshooting, this high level map is useful in narrowing down and isolating where a problem or fault is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=[[American Radio Relay League]] (ARRL) | title =ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications | edition =Eighty-Third | publisher =Amateur Radio Relay League |ISBN=0-87259-948-5 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block diagrams rely on the principle of the [[black box]] where the contents are hidden from view either to avoid being distracted by the details or because the details are not known. We know what goes in, we know what goes out, but we can't see how the box does its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Nilsson | first =James W. | publication-date =October 1986 | date =1986 | title =Electric Circuits
 | edition =Second | publisher =Addison Wesley Publishing Company |isbn =0-201-12695-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hayes&gt;{{Citation | last =Hayes | first =John P. |date=1988 | title =Computer Architecture and | edition =Second | publisher =McGraw Hill Publishing Company |pages=89–92 | isbn =0-07-027366-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]], a design will often begin as a very high level block diagram, becoming more and more detailed block diagrams as the design progresses, finally ending in block diagrams detailed enough that each individual block can be easily implemented (at which point the block diagram is also a schematic diagram). This is known as [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down design]].&lt;ref name=hayes/&gt; [[List of geometric shapes|Geometric shapes]] are often used in the diagram to aid interpretation and clarify meaning of the process or model. The geometric shapes are connected by lines to indicate association and direction/order of traversal. Each engineering discipline has their own meaning for each shape. Block diagrams are used in every discipline of engineering. They are also a valuable source of concept building and educationally beneficial in non-engineering disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iqbal|first=Sajid |title= Concept Building through Block Diagram Using Matlab/Simulink |journal= New Horizons|year=2010|volume=66–67|pages=30–34 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mei|first=C.|title= On teaching the simplification of block diagrams|journal= International Journal of Engineering Education|year=2002|pages=697–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[process control]], block diagrams are a [[visual language]] for describing actions in a complex system in which blocks are [[black box]]es that represent mathematical or logical operations that occur in sequence from left to right and top to bottom, but not the physical entities, such as processors or relays, that perform those operations. It is possible to create such block diagrams and implement their functionality with specialized programmable logic controller (PLC) programming languages.

In [[biology]] there is an increasing use of engineering principles, techniques of analysis and methods of diagramming. There is some similarity between the block diagram and what is called [[Systems Biology Graphical Notation]]. As it is there is use made in [[systems biology]] of the block diagram technique harnessed by [[control engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;Cosentino, C. &amp; Bates, D. 2011. Feedback control in systems biology. New York : CRC Press&lt;/ref&gt; where the latter itself is an application of [[control theory]].
 
An example of this is the [[function block diagram]], one of five programming languages defined in part 3 of the IEC 61131 (see [[IEC 61131-3]]) standard that is highly formalized (see [[formal system]]), with strict rules for how diagrams are to be built. Directed lines are used to connect input variables to block inputs, and block outputs to output variables and inputs of other blocks.

'''Charismatic authority''' is a concept about leadership that was developed by the German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. It involves a type of [[organization]] or a type of [[leadership]] in which [[authority]] derives from the [[charisma]] of the leader. This stands in contrast to two other types of authority: [[legal authority]] and [[traditional authority]]. Each of the three types forms part of [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]].

"Charisma" is an ancient Greek term that initially gained prominence through Saint Paul's letters to the emerging Christian communities in the first century. In this context, it generally referred to a divinely-originating "gift" that demonstrated the authority of God within the early leaders of the Church. [[Max Weber]] took this theological notion and generalized it, viewing it as something that followers attribute, thereby opening it up for use by [[sociologist]]s who applied it to political, military, celebrity, and non-Christian religious contests.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms used are "charismatic domination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o12f99.htm Power, Domination, Legitimation, and Authority] Sociology 250 Retrieved October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and "charismatic leadership".&lt;ref&gt;
Adair-Toteff,  Christopher, ''Max Weber’s Charisma'', ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', Vol. 5, No. 2, 189-204 (2005)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

===Charisma===
Weber applies the term [[charisma]] to 
{{quote|[A] certain quality of an individual personality, by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These are such as are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader ... How the quality in question would be ultimately judged from an ethical, aesthetic, or other such point of view is naturally indifferent for the purpose of definition.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Maximillan. ''Theory of Social and Economic Organization.'' Chapter: "The Nature of Charismatic Authority and its Routinization" translated by A. R. Anderson and [[Talcott Parsons]], 1947. Originally published in 1922 in German under the title [http://www.textlog.de/7415.html ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'' chapter III, § 10] (available online)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Original German: "»Charisma« soll eine als außeralltäglich (ursprünglich, sowohl bei Propheten wie bei therapeutischen wie bei Rechts-Weisen wie bei Jagdführern wie bei Kriegshelden: als magisch bedingt) geltende Qualität einer Persönlichkeit heißen, um derentwillen sie als mit übernatürlichen oder übermenschlichen oder mindestens spezifisch außeralltäglichen, nicht jedem andern zugänglichen Kräften oder Eigenschaften oder als gottgesandt oder als vorbildlich und deshalb als »Führer« gewertet wird."}}}}

===Legitimization===
Charismatic authority is often the most lasting of regimes because the leader is seen as infallible and any action against him will be seen as a crime against the state. Charismatic leaders eventually develop a [[cult of personality]] often not by their own doing. 
{{quote|[P]ower legitimized on the basis of a leader's exceptional personal qualities or the demonstration of extraordinary insight and accomplishment, which inspire loyalty and obedience from followers.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Diana, Jane Lothian Murray, and Rick Linden. ''Sociology in our time'' (2nd ed.), 2000. Scarborough, On: Nelson, 438-439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leadership is the power to diffuse a positive energy and a sense of greatness. As such, it rests almost entirely on the [[leadership|leader]]. The absence of that leader for any reason can lead to the authority's power dissolving. However, due to its idiosyncratic nature and lack of formal [[organization]], charismatic authority depends much more strongly on the perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority than Weber's other forms of authority. For instance, a charismatic leader in a [[religion|religious]] context might require an unchallenged [[belief]] that the leader has been touched by [[God]], in the sense of a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousauthority/a/types_2.htm Charismatic Authority: Emotional Bonds Between Leaders and Followers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Should the strength of this belief fade, the power of the charismatic leader can fade quickly, which is one of the ways in which this form of authority shows itself to be unstable.

In contrast to the current popular use of the term ''charismatic leader'', Weber saw charismatic authority not so much as character traits of the charismatic leader but as a relationship between the leader and his followers. The validity of [[charism]] is founded on its "recognition" by the leader's followers (or "adepts" - ''Anhänger''). 
His charisma risks disappearing if he is "abandoned by God" or if "his government doesn't provide any prosperity to those whom he dominates".{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A Weber-style charismatic leader need not be a positive force;&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology'' By Jens Beckert, Milan Zafirovski, Published by Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-28673-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-28673-2}}, pag. 53&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] qualify. Furthermore, sociology is [[axiology|axiologically]] neutral (''Wertfreie Soziologie'') towards various forms of charismatic domination: it does not differentiate between the charisma of a [[Berserker]], of a [[shaman]] or of that displayed by [[Kurt Eisner]]. For Weber, sociology considers these types of charismatic domination in "an identical manner to the charisma of [[hero]]es, prophets, the "greatest saviours according to common appreciation".}}

=== Routinizing charisma ===
Charismatic authority almost always endangers the boundaries set by [[traditional authority|traditional]] (coercive) or [[Rational-legal authority|rational]] (legal) authority. It tends to challenge this authority, and is thus often seen as [[revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/weber_links.html WEBER LINKS page http&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426080033/http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/weber_links.html |date=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, Seth D. "Religion; the modern theories" University of Edinburgh 2003 {{ISBN|0-7486-1522-9}} page 40&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this charismatic authority is incorporated into society. Hereby the challenge that it presents to society will subside. The way in which this happens is called ''routinization''.

By routinization,  the charismatic authority changes: 
{{quote|[C]harismatic authority is succeeded by a bureaucracy controlled by a rationally established authority or by a combination of traditional and bureaucratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Beeghley, and Powers, 1995 cited in Kendal et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A religion which evolves its own [[priesthood]] and establishes a set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another type of authority. For example, [[Muhammad]], who had charismatic authority as "The Prophet" among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of [[Islam]], a clear example of routinization.

In politics, charismatic rule is often found in various [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian states]], [[Autocracy|autocracies]], [[dictatorship]]s and [[Theocracy|theocracies]]. To help to maintain their charismatic authority, such regimes will often establish a vast [[personality cult]]. When the leader of such a state dies or leaves office, and a new charismatic leader does not appear, such a regime is likely to fall shortly thereafter, unless it has become fully routinized.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology'' By Jens Beckert, Milan Zafirovski, Published by Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-28673-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-28673-2}}, pag. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charismatic succession==
Because the [[authority]] is concentrated in one leader, the death of the charismatic leader would constitute the destruction of the government unless prior arrangements were made. A society that faces the end of their charismatic leader can choose to move to another format of [[leadership]] or to have a transference of charismatic authority to another leader by means of succession.

According to Max Weber, the methods of succession are: search, revelation, designation by original leader, designation by qualified staff, hereditary charisma, and office charisma.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}} These are the various ways in which an individual and a society can contrive to maintain the unique energy and nature of charisma in their leadership.

===Search===
"The search for a new charismatic leader (takes place) on the basis of the qualities which will fit him for the position of [[authority]]." An example of this search method is the search for a new [[Dalai Lama]]. "It consists in a search for a child with characteristics which are interpreted to mean that he is a [[reincarnation]] of the [[Buddha]]." This search is an example of the way in which an original charismatic leader can be made to "live on" through a replacement.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Revelation===
"In this case the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of selection." The technique of selection is the ''modus operandi'' of the selection process. In ancient times, [[oracles]] were believed to have special access to "divine judgment" and thus their technique in selection was perceived to be [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]]. Their choice was imbued with the charismatic authority that came with the oracle's endorsement.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Designation by original leader===
In this form, the original holder of charismatic authority is perceived to have passed their authority to another. An excellent example is [[Joseph Stalin]]'s claim that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had designated him to be his successor as leader of the USSR. Insofar as people believed in this claim, Stalin gained Lenin's charismatic authority.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Designated by qualified staff===
"A successor (may be designated) by the charismatically qualified administrative staff... (T)his process should not be interpreted as 'election' or 'nomination'... It is not determined by merely a majority vote...Unanimity (is) often required." A case example of this form of succession is the [[papal conclave]] of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] to choose a new [[pope]]. The cardinals taking part in the papal conclave are viewed to be charismatically qualified by their [[Roman Catholic]] congregations and thus their choice is imbued with charismatic authority.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Hereditary charisma===
Charisma can be perceived as "a quality transmitted by heredity". This method of succession is present in [[Kim il Sung]]'s charisma being passed on to his son, [[Kim Jong Il]]. This type of succession is a difficult undertaking and often results in a movement toward [[Traditional authority|traditionalization]] and [[Rational-legal authority|legalization]] in [[authority]].{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-B}}{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-D}}

===Office charisma===
"The concept of charisma may be transmitted by [[ritual]] means from one bearer to another...It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular individual, making it an objective, transferable entity." [[Consecration|Priestly consecration]] is believed to be a modus through which priestly charisma to teach and perform other priestly duties is transferred to a person. In this way, [[priest]]s inherit priestly charisma and are subsequently perceived by their congregations as having the charismatic authority that comes with the priesthood.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

==Application of Weber's theories==
Weber's model of charismatic leadership giving way to institutionalization is endorsed by several academic sociologists.

===New religious movements===
[[Eileen Barker]] discusses the tendency for [[new religious movement]]s to have founders or leaders who wield considerable charismatic authority and are believed to have special powers or knowledge.  Charismatic leaders are unpredictable, Barker says, for they are not bound by tradition or rules and they may be accorded by their followers the right to pronounce on all aspects of their lives. Barker warns that in these cases the leader may lack any accountability, require unquestioning obedience, and encourage a dependency upon the movement for material, spiritual and social resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, {{ISBN|0-11-340927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] asserts that not all new religious movements have charismatic leaders, and that there are differences in the hegemonic styles among those movements that do.&lt;ref&gt;[[George D. Chryssides|Chryssides, George D.]] ''Unrecognized charisma? A study and comparison of four charismatic leaders: Charles Taze Russell, Joseph Smith, L Ron Hubbard, Swami Prabhupada.'' Paper presented at the 2001 International Conference The Spiritual Supermarket: Religious Pluralism in the 21st Century, organised by [[INFORM]] and [[CESNUR]] (London, April 19–22, 2001). [http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/chryssides.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism==
[[Len Oakes]], an [[Australia]]n psychologist who wrote a [[dissertation]] about charisma, had eleven charismatic leaders fill in a psychometric test, which he called the ''adjective checklist'', and found them as a group quite ordinary. Following the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Heinz Kohut]], Oakes argues that charismatic leaders exhibit traits of [[narcissism]] and also argues that they display an extraordinary amount of energy, accompanied by an inner clarity unhindered by the anxieties and guilt that afflict more ordinary people. He did however not fully follow Weber's framework of charismatic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Len: ''Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-8156-0398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4700">In [[physics]], a '''coincidence circuit''' is an [[electronic device]] with one output and two (or more) inputs. The output activates only when the circuit receives signals within a time window accepted as ''at the same time'' and in parallel at both inputs. Coincidence circuits are widely used in [[particle detector]]s and in other areas of science and technology.  

[[Walther Bothe]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1954 "...for his discovery of the method of coincidence and the discoveries subsequently made by it." [[Bruno Rossi]] invented the electronic coincidence circuit for implementing the [[coincidence method]].

==History==
===Bothe, 1924===
In his Nobel Prize lecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/bothe-lecture.html |title=Nobel Lecture |author=Bothe, Walther |year=1954 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}} &lt;/ref&gt; Bothe described how he had implemented the [[coincidence method]] in an experiment on [[Compton scattering]] in 1924. The experiment aimed to check whether Compton scattering produces a [[recoil electron]] simultaneously with the scattered [[gamma ray]]. Bothe used two point discharge counters connected to separate fibre [[electrometer]]s and recorded the fibre  deflections on a moving photographic film. On the film record he could discern coincident discharges with a time resolution of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]].

===Bothe and Kohlhörster, 1929===
In 1929, Walther Bothe and [[Werner Kolhörster]] published the description of a coincidence experiment with tubular discharge counters that [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Wilhelm Müller]] had invented in 1928. The Bothe-Kohlhörster experiment showed penetrating charged particles in [[cosmic ray]]s. They used the same mechanical-photographic method for recording simultaneous discharges which, in this experiment, signalled the passage of a charged cosmic ray particle through both counters and through thick wall of lead and iron that surrounded the counters. Their paper, entitled ''Das Wesen der Höhenstrahlung"'', was published in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' v.56, p.751 (1929).

===Rossi, 1930===
Bruno Rossi, at the age of 24, was in his first job as assistant in the Physics Institute of the [[University of Florence]] when he read the Bothe-Kohlhörster paper. It inspired him to begin his own research on cosmic rays. He fabricated [[Geiger tube]]s according to the published recipe, and he invented the first practical electronic coincident circuit. It employed several [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]]s, and could register coincident pulses from any number of counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution over the mechanical method of Bothe. Rossi described his invention in a paper entitled "Method of Registering Multiple Simultaneous Impulses of Several Geiger Counters", published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' v.125, p.636 (1930). The Rossi coincidence circuit was rapidly adopted by experimenters around the world. It was the first practical [[Logical conjunction|AND]] circuit, precursor of the AND logic circuits of [[electronic computer]]s. 

To detect the voltage pulse produced by the coincidence circuit when a coincidence event occurred, Rossi first used earphones and counted the ‘clicks’, and soon an electro-mechanical register to count the coincidence pulses automatically. Rossi used a triple-coincidence version of his circuit with various configurations of Geiger counters in a series of experiments during the period from 1930 to 1943 that laid an essential part of the foundations of cosmic-ray and particle physics. 

About the same time, and independently of Rossi, Bothe devised a less practical electronic coincidence device. It used a single [[pentode]] vacuum tube and could register only twofold coincidences.

==Probability==
The main idea of 'coincidence detection' in signal processing is that if a detector detects a signal pulse in the midst of random noise pulses inherent in the detector, there is a certain probability, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that the detected pulse is actually a noise pulse. But if two detectors detect the signal pulse simultaneously, the probability that it is a noise pulse in the detectors is &lt;math&gt;P^2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;P=0.1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;P^2=0.01&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the chance of a false detection is reduced by the use of coincidence detection.

== Environmental issues ==
The coral reefs are under threat due to environmental issues such as [[overfishing]], pollution, hurricanes, and disease. Since the 1970s, Jamaica's coral reef cover has declined more than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/02/caribbean-coral-reef-lost-fishing-pollution-report|title=Caribbean coral reefs ‘will be lost within 20 years’ without protection|last=Aldred|first=Jessica|date=2014-07-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, up to 95 percent of the coral was bleached in some locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Overfishing ===
Jamaica's coral reefs house 135 different species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klomp|first=Kristi|date=2003|title=Condition of Reef Fish on Jamaica's North Coast Signals Late Stages of Over Exploitation|url=http://aquaticcommons.org/13590/1/gcfi_54-49.pdf|journal=54th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute|pages=592–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1998, fishing licenses increased by 68 percent for the Montego Bay Marine Park where 69 percent of fishers rely on fishing as their full-time income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunce|first=L.|last2=Gustavson|first2=K.|last3=Williams|first3=J.|last4=Miller|first4=M.|date=1999-12-01|title=The human side of reef management: a case study analysis of the socioeconomic framework of Montego Bay Marine Park|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380050215|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=369–380|doi=10.1007/s003380050215|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 on Jamaica's north coast, trap fishermen set 1800 traps which was at least two times above sustainability levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fish density dwindled to 9.8 fish per 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Status of Caribbean Coral Reefs after Bleaching and Hurricanes in 2005|last=Jones|first=Loureene|publisher=Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network|year=2008|location=Townsville, Australia|pages=73–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing has reduced the herbivorous fish that keep algae populations in check and it has caused a phase shift from coral reefs to algae reefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, algae covers 24 percent of the reefs where corals once stood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1960, fish biomass was reduced by 80 percent due to overfishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fish that are vital to coral reef survival, such as the Parrot fish, have been driven to near extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/content/despair-repair-dramatic-decline-caribbean-corals-can-be-reversed|title=From despair to repair: Dramatic decline of Caribbean corals can be reversed|date=2014-06-30|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, overfishing has also been linked to the disappearance of the black sea urchin, ''[[Diadema antillarum]],'' which also helped to reduce microalgal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 16, 2009|title=Disaster and Recovery of the Fringing Reefs of North Jamaica|url=|journal=CO2 Science|volume=12|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Sewage pollution has led to [[eutrophication]] which results in an abundance of nutrients for microalgal populations to bloom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapointe|first=B. E.|last2=Thacker|first2=K.|last3=Hanson|first3=C.|last4=Getten|first4=L.|date=2011-07-01|title=Sewage pollution in Negril, Jamaica: effects on nutrition and ecology of coral reef macroalgae|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00343-011-0506-8|journal=Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=775–789|doi=10.1007/s00343-011-0506-8|issn=0254-4059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Environmental Program determined that 85 percent of the sewage entering the Caribbean ocean is untreated.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wear|first=Stephanie L.|last2=Thurber|first2=Rebecca Vega|date=2015-10-01|title=Sewage pollution: mitigation is key for coral reef stewardship|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12785/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1355|issue=1|pages=15–30|doi=10.1111/nyas.12785|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raw sewage contains dissolved inorganic nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals, and toxins that can cause coral bleaching, disease, increased mortality, and decreased coral growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study concluded that increased nutrients such as, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, doubled the probability of coral diseases and tripled the probability of bleaching.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An increase of inorganic nitrogen was also linked to the presence of pathogens which can lead to coral mortality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The heavy metals prevent respiration and nerve communication within the coral which also leads to coral mortality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Hurricanes ===
Major hurricane events include Hurricane Allen in 1980, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and Hurricane Ivan in 2004.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2005, there were a record breaking 26 storms recorded that caused 26 events of bleaching in 16 of Jamaica's coral reef sites.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The hurricanes affected 68 percent of Jamaica's coral reefs and 38 percent of those corals later died.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In September 2005, up to 95 percent of Jamaica's corals had bleached, but only 50 percent recovered later.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result of the 2005 hurricane, microalgal blooms took over where the corals once were.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Disease ===
The Caribbean's coral reefs have been increasingly becoming diseased by 20 percent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Coral diseases can cause tissue damage or it could even destroy the entire colony.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1980, white-band disease killed 95 percent of the ''Acroporid palmata'' and ''Acroporid cervicornis'' colonies which placed them on the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2010 study concluded that sewage runoff in was correlated to the white pox coral disease that destroyed the ''Acroporid palmata'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=Kathryn Patterson|last2=Porter|first2=James W.|last3=Turner|first3=Jeffrey W.|last4=Thomas|first4=Brian J.|last5=Looney|first5=Erin E.|last6=Luna|first6=Trevor P.|last7=Meyers|first7=Meredith K.|last8=Futch|first8=J.

'''Essence-Function''' (體用, Chinese pinyin: ''tǐ yòng'', Korean: ''che-yong''), also called '''Substance and Function''', is a key concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] and other Far-Eastern philosophies. ''Essence'' is Absolute Reality, the fundamental "cause" or origin, while ''Function'' is relative or concrete reality, the concrete manifestation of ''Essence''. Ti and yong do not represent two separate things, such as Absolute Reality and Concrete Reality. They are always two, flexibly-viewed aspects of a single thing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acmuller.net/articles/2016-06-tiyong-critical-review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=July 2017}}

==Etymology==
* ''Essence'', [[:wikt:體|體]] (ti), Korean pronunciation 체, or ''CHE'': body; shape, form; entity, unit; style, fashion, system; substance, essence; theory (as opposed to practice).{{r|group=web|Sheik}} 
* ''Function'', [[:wikt:用|用]] (yong), Korean pronunciation 용, or ''YONG'':use, employ, apply, operate; exert; use; effect; finance; need; eat, drink.{{r|group=web|Sheik2}}

Together they form the phrase 體用 ti-yong, 체용 che-yong, ''Essence-Function''.

''Essence'' is Absolute Reality, the fundamental "cause" or origin, while ''Function'' is manifest or relative reality, the discernible effects or manifestations of ''Essence''.{{sfn|Muller|2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}} ''Essence-Function'' describes the interplay between the two: although Absolute Reality is the ultimate reality, the relative reality nevertheless also exists, as is evident from concrete reality. The relationship between these two realms is espressed in such schemata as the [[Five Ranks]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]]. Various terms are used for "absolute" and "relative".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}

The tree forms a metaphor for ''Essence-Function'', with the roots being ''Essence'' and the branches being ''Function''.{{sfn|Muller|2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}} According to Muller "the most important application of t'i-yung thought [...] is to the human being, where the human mind is seen as "essence," and one's words, thoughts and actions are seen as "function."{{sfn|Muller|1999|p=4}}

According to Sung-bae Park the concept of ''essence-function'' is used by East Asian Buddhists "to show a non-dualistic and non-discriminate nature in their [[Kensho|enlightenment experience]]," but does not exclude notions of subjectivity and objectivity.{{sfn|Park|1983|p=147}} According to Sung-bae Park, the terms "essence" and "function" can also be rendered as "body" and "the body's functions," which is a more personal and less abstract expression of nonduality.{{sfn|Park|2009|p=11}}

==Origins and application of the concept==

===China===
The t'i-yung developed in the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] (220–265) – [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Chin]] (265–420) period of Chinese history, when "Unification of the [[Three teachings|Three Teachings]]" ideology was domimant, striving for a theoretical reconciliation of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The t'i-yung concept was first known as ''pen-mo'' ("primary-last" or "primary-subordinate"), and developed into t'i-yung. In the initial development of the theory, "thinkers considered one of the three philosophies as 'the primary' or 't'i' and the others as 'the last' or 'yung,' insisting that their own philosophy was superior to the others."{{sfn|Kim|2004|p=139}} However, although the theory was used to arrange the three teachings hierarchically, it also confirmed their inner unity.{{sfn|Kim|2004|pp=139–144}}

The concept developed with [[Chinese Buddhism|the introduction of Buddhism in China]], adapting Buddhist philosophy to a Chinese frame of reference. One of the core [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhist doctrines is the [[Two Truths doctrine]], which says that there is a relative truth and an ultimate truth. In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Phenomenal reality is relative real or true: one can make factual statements about concrete or manifest reality, but those statements have a relative trueness, since everything that exists changes, and is bound to dissolve again. Ultimately everything is empty, [[sunyata]], of an underlying unchanging essence.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata itself is also "empty," 'the emptiness of emptiness', which means that ''sunyata'' itself does not constitute a higher or ultimate "essence" or "reality.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}} The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]]  and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} 

When Buddhism was introduced to China, the two truths doctrine was a point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} The doctrines of [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Sunyata]] were understood as akin to [[Tao|Dao]] and the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}}  It took the Chinese world several centuries to realize that sunyata has another meaning.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

Based on their understanding of the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths. The idea that ultimate reality is present within the daily world of relative reality melded well with Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as [[Nagarjuna]] does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}

The notions appear already in the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean|Zhongyong]]'' (''Doctrine of the Mean'') attributed to [[Zi Si]] (481–402 BCE), the grandson of [[Confucius]]. The first philosopher to systematically use the ti-yong schema was [[Wang Bi]] (226–249) in his commentary to [[Daodejing]], chapter 22, when he discussed the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relation between non-being (''wu'') and being (''you''). Subsequently, the notion has been borrowed from the [[Neo-Daoist]] philosophy to other schools of Chinese philosophy, including [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] and other schools of Buddhism, and [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]], and served as a basic tool of interpretation. With these schools it has travelled to Korea, Japan and Vietnam, and has been developed there.

The ''[[Awakening of Mahayana Faith]]'', a key text in Chinese Buddhism, also employs ''Essence-Function''. Although attributed to [[Aśvaghoṣa]] (?80-?150 CE), and traditionally thought to have been translated [[Paramartha]] (499–569),{{sfn|Tarocco|2008}} in 553, many modern scholars now opine that it was actually composed by Paramartha or one of his students.{{sfn|Grosnick|1989}}

The concept was employed by Confucian reformers of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] at the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]'s (1644 to 1912) rule in China, in the phrase "Chinese learning for essence, Western learning for application".{{refn|group=note|({{zh|t=中學為體，西學為用|s=中学为体，西学为用|p= zhōng xué wéi tǐ, xī xué wéi yòng}}}} The belief was that China should maintain its own Confucian style of learning to keep the "essence" of society, while at the same time using Western learning for "practical application" in developing its infrastructure and economy.{{sfn|Spence|1999|pp=225–226}}

===Korean Buddhism===
''Essence-Function'' is an essential element in the philosophy of [[Wonhyo]] (617–686 CE).{{sfn|Muller|1995|pp=33–48}} Wonhyo developed t'i-yung theory into its most influential form in his commentary on the ''Ta ch'eng ch'i hsin lun'' (''Treatise on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith''). This scripture proclaims the non-duality of the phenomenal or mundane world and the ''[[tathagata-garbha]]''.{{sfn|Kim|2004|p=163}} Wonhyo saw the ''Treatise'''s treatment of ''t'i-yung'' as a way of harmonizing the thought of Madhyamika and Yogacara. For Wonhyo, ''t'i'' corresponds to Madhyamika's ultimate truth and ''yung'' to its conventional truth, and these, in turn, are the two gates of Yogacara's one-mind.{{sfn|Kim|2004|pp=164–166}}

[[Chinul]] (1158–1210) and [[Kihwa]] (1376–1433) also employ and develop this idea of Essence-Function in their writings in particular ways.{{sfn|Muller|1995}} [[Wonch'uk]] (613–696) employed the conceptual and analytical tool, Essence-Function, as an exegetical, hermeneutical and syncretic device.

[[File:4243 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 28 - In fidelitate nullli gero - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 30-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale in Venice]]: [[:commons:Category:Capitals in the Doge's Palace (Venice) - 28|capital # 28]] in the porch, featuring Virtues and vices - '''In fidelitate nulli gero''' (Fidelity)]]

'''Fidelity''' is the quality of [[faithfulness]] or [[loyalty]]. Its original meaning regarded [[duty]] in a broader sense than the related concept of ''[[fealty]]''. Both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''fidēlis'', meaning "faithful or loyal". In the [[City of London]] financial markets it has traditionally been used in the sense encompassed in the motto "My word is my bond".

==&lt;span id="lofi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Audio and electronics==
{{redirect|Low fidelity|the aesthetic|Lo-fi music}}
{{see also|Sound recording and reproduction}}
In audio, "fidelity" denotes how accurately a copy reproduces its source. For example, a worn [[gramophone record]] will have a lower fidelity than one in good condition, and a recording made by a low budget record company in the early 20th century is likely to have significantly less audio fidelity than a good modern recording. In the 1950s, the terms "[[high fidelity]]" or "hi-fi" were popularized for equipment and recordings which exhibited more accurate [[sound reproduction]]. Similarly in [[electronics]], fidelity refers to the correspondence of the output signal to the input signal, rather than sound quality, as in the popular internet connection technology "[[Wi-Fi]]".

==&lt;span id="scimodsim"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scientific modelling and simulation==
In the fields of [[scientific modelling]] and [[simulation]], fidelity refers to the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object, feature or condition.  Fidelity is therefore a measure of the realism of a model or simulation.&lt;ref name=SISO/&gt;  Simulation fidelity has also been described in the past as "degree of similarity".&lt;ref name=HaysSinger/&gt; In quantum mechanics and optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=D.|last2=Harte|first2=T.

==Program evaluation==
In the field of [[program evaluation]], the term fidelity denotes how closely a set of procedures were implemented as they were supposed to have been. For example, it is difficult to draw conclusions from a study about formative assessment in school classrooms if the teachers are not able or willing to follow the procedures they received in training.&lt;ref name=ODonnell/&gt;

:''For the band, see [[Glass Harp (band)]] or for the similar instrument, see [[Glass harmonica]]''.

A '''glass harp''' (also called '''musical glasses''',''' singing glasses''', '''angelic organ''', '''verrilion''' or '''ghost fiddle''') is a [[musical instrument]] made of upright [[wine glass]]es.

It is played by running moistened or chalked fingers around the rim of the glasses. Each glass is tuned to a different pitch, either by grinding each goblet to the specified pitch, in which case the tuning is invariable, or by filling the glass with water until the desired pitch is achieved.

==History==

Musical glasses were documented in [[Persian traditional music|Persia]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]] (1969). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TMdf1SioFk4C&amp;pg=PA347&amp;dq=Adagio+and+Rondo+for+glass+harmonica,+flute,+oboe,+viola+and+cello&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFks6PxPjRAhUF94MKHY7_AZAQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Adagio%20and%20Rondo%20for%20glass%20harmonica%2C%20flute%2C%20oboe%2C%20viola%20and%20cello&amp;f=false Harvard Dictionary of Music]'', p.347. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674375017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The glass harp was created in 1741 by Irishman [[Richard Pockrich (inventor)|Richard Pockrich]], who is known as the first virtuoso of the musical glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pockrich called his instrument the "angelic organ" and it was played with sticks, rather than by rubbing the glasses with a moistened finger. It was reported in 1760 that, "Pockrich played Handel's ''[[Water Music]]'' on the glasses."&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; His successful concert career was brought to a premature end by a fire in which both the inventor and instrument perished in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Sibyl Marcuse, "Angelic Organ", ''Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary'', corrected edition, Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W.Norton, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] played the musical glasses. He performed in London in 1746,&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; and Copenhagen. His instrument consisted of 26 goblets,&lt;ref&gt;Sibyl Marcuse, "Musical Glasses", ''Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary'', corrected edition, Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W.Norton, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; "filled with spring water."&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

The instrument was popular in the 18th century. Pockrich's contemporary, Ford, published ''Instructions for the Playing of the Musical Glasses'' while Bartl published a German version.&lt;ref&gt;P1205; ''[[W. A. Mozart]]''; Hermann Abert, Stewart Spencer (translator), Cliff Eisen; Yale University Press, 2007; {{ISBN|0-300-07223-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 [[Bruno Hoffmann]] invented a glass harp consisting, "of 46 individually tuned glasses fixed on a resonant table."&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

===''The Art of Instrumentation''===
{{quote|This instrument, consisting of a number of tuned glasses, adapts itself excellently for the accompaniment of a [[Zither]], owing to its delicate tonal-quality. The following is its usual compass: [image: G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] But some possess a compass of only two octaves from [image: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] to [image: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]. Its tone [timbre] is very similar to the [[harmonic]]s of a Zither, and if treated skilfully can be easily produced, in all tonal-shadings, from the most delicate 'pianissimo' to a moderate 'forte.' It is very effective as a solo instrument, with the accompaniment of a muted [[string quartet]]te. Only [[sustain (music)|sustained]] songs and [[melody|melodious]] passages are adapted for this instrument.|Prof. Henri Kling, ''The Art of Instrumentation'' (1905)&lt;ref&gt;Kling, Henri (1905).

On March 9, 1938, [[Bruno Hoffmann]] performed on the glass harp at the London Museum in a program including Mozart's Adagio (K. 356) and Quintet for harmonica, flute, viola, oboe, and cello (K. 617), accompanied by [[Geoffrey Gilbert]], [[Leon Goossens]], [[Frederick Riddle]], and James Whitehead. It was an "exquisite performance, in which the flute and viola in their upper registers were almost indistinguishable from the glasses, [which] held spell-bound a large audience, crowded over the floor, stairs and galleries".&lt;ref&gt;A. Hyatt King, "The Musical Glasses and Glass Harmonica", ''Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association'', 72nd Session (1945–46): 97–122. Citation on 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 1979, [[Gloria Parker]] performed as a musical glasses [[solo (music)|solo]]ist with the [[Hartford Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Jai alai|Jai Alai]] Fronton in Hartford, Connecticut, USA. [[Richard Hayman]], noted for his arrangements for [[Boston Pops]] conductor [[Arthur Fiedler]], was the guest conductor for the 90-piece orchestra that accompanied the musical glasses which included songs such as "[[Lara's Theme]]" from the movie ''[[Dr. Zhivago (film)|Dr. Zhivago]]'', "[[Lover (song)|Lover]]" and "[[Amor (1943 song)|Amor"]].

There are several current musicians who professionally play the glass harp. Among them are the [[Glass Duo]] from Poland, Philipp Marguerre and Clemens Hofinger in Germany, France's Jean Chatillion and Thomas Bloch, Brien Engel, and Dennis James in the United States and Canada's Real Berthiaume.
Glasses have been also used by famous rock band [[Pink Floyd]] during the recording of "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" on their ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' album, recorded and released in 1975. [[Igor Sklyarov (musician)|Igor Sklyarov]] played the glass harp on the same song during two 2006 concerts recorded in [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by former guitarist [[David Gilmour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Igor Sklyarov takes part in David Gilmour's Venetian concerts | url=http://www.crystaltrio.com/eng_projects-2-719.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmour also used the effect during his August 26, 2006, concert in [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]], with the help of [[Guy Pratt]], [[Phil Manzanera]] and [[Dick Parry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Shine On You Crazy Diamond Part I (Live in Gdansk - David Gilmour) | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o76NEJCXG78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both recordings are available on Gilmour's ''[[Live in Gdańsk]]'' CD, although the Venice recording is only available on the five-disc version of the album or as an internet download with the three- and four-disc versions.

A colorful set of water tuned glasses is depicted as being played with a pair of metal sticks in several key scenes of the extremely successful 2009 Korean TV drama ''[[Queen Seon Deok]]'', showing the series' main anti-heroine [[Mishil]] ([[Go Hyun-jung]]) playing her own haunting theme melody ''Yurijan (Glasses)'' on that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., minutes 1:04 to 4:37 of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-5agx2k1Wc scene #6 of the second episode] (birth of the future queen Seondeok).&lt;/ref&gt;

*''A Toast To Christmas with the Singing Glasses'' is an album recorded and released in 1980, composed and performed by [[Gloria Parker]]. Fourteen well-known carols are performed with the glass harp producing flute-like sounds on crystal glasses, marking the first commercial album to use glasses as a musical instrument.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''''Going postal''''' is an [[American English]] [[slang]] phrase referring to becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment. The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1986 onward in which [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or general public in acts of [[mass murder]]. Between 1970 and 1997, more than 40 people were killed by current or former employees in at least 20 incidents of [[workplace rage]]. Between 1986 and 2011, workplace shootings happened at roughly two per year, with an average of 12 people killed per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asisonline.org/globalassets/foundation/documents/crisp-reports/crisp_mass-homicides-by-employees-american-workplace.pdf|title=Mass Homicides by Employees in the American Workplace|last=Lee|first=Seungmug|last2=McCrie|first2=Robert|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The earliest known use of the phrase was on December 17, 1993, in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'':

{{quote|The symposium was sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service, which has seen so many outbursts that in some circles excessive stress is known as 'going postal.' Thirty-five people have been killed in 11 post office shootings since 1983. The USPS does not approve of the term "going postal" and has made attempts to stop people from using the saying. Some postal workers, however, feel it has earned its place.&lt;ref name="vick"&gt;Vick, Karl, "Violence at work tied to loss of esteem", ''St. Petersburg Times'', Dec 17, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On December 31, 1993, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated:

{{quote|Unlike the more deadly mass shootings around the nation, which have lent a new term to the language, referring to shooting up the office as "going postal".&lt;ref&gt;"The Year in Review 1993", ''Los Angeles Times'', December 31, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A former United States postal worker, Joseph M. Harris, killed his former supervisor, Carol Ott, and killed her boyfriend, Cornelius Kasten Jr., at their home.  The following morning, on October 10, 1991, Harris shot and killed two mail handlers, Joseph M.

===Royal Oak, Michigan, 1991===
[[File:RoyalOakPostoffice.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The U.S. post office in Royal Oak]]

On November 14, 1991 in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], Thomas McIlvane killed five people, including himself, with a rifle in Royal Oak's post office, after being fired from the Postal Service for "insubordination." He had been previously suspended for getting into altercations with postal customers on his route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

For some time prior to the Royal Oak incident the service had experienced labor/management and operational problems and customer service complaints. This had drawn the attention of local media. The Office of Senator Carl Levin investigated Royal Oak, the results of which were summarized in a September 10, 1991, staff memorandum. The memorandum documented "patterns of harassment, intimidation, cruelty and allegations of favoritism in promotions and demotions ... [and] testimony relating to wide-ranging delivery and service problems" prior to the McIlvane shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1462820409|title=The Tainted Eagle|last=Withers|first=Charlie|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A post office tragedy:the shooting at Royal Oak, report of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, 102 Congress, {{ISBN|9780160386589}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two events in 1993===
Two shootings took place on the same day, May 6, 1993, a few hours apart. At a post office in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], Lawrence Jasion wounded three and killed one, and subsequently killed himself. In [[Dana Point, California]], Mark Richard Hilbun killed his mother and her dog, then shot two postal workers dead.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory K. Moffatt, Blind-Sided: Homicide Where It Is Least Expected, at 37 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of these two shootings, in 1993 the  USPS created 85 Workplace Environment Analysts for domicile at its 85 postal districts. These new positions were created to help with violence prevention and workplace improvement. In February 2009, the   USPS unilaterally eliminated these positions as part of its downsizing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Musacco|first=Stephen|title=Beyond going postal: Shifting from workplace tragedies and toxic workplace environments to a safe and healthy organization|year=2009|publisher=Booksurge|page=34|quote=the notion of 'going postal' as a myth is not supported by the overwhelming evidence to the contrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goleta, California, 2006===

===Baker City, Oregon, 2006===
Grant Gallaher, a letter carrier in [[Baker City, Oregon]], pleaded guilty to the April 4, 2006 murder of his supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aeA4AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vhQGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1870,1355376&amp;dq=grant-gallaher&amp;hl=en|title=Gallaher Sentenced in Baker County Circuit Court|date=August 16, 2006|work=Hells Canyon Journal|page=3|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly brought his [[.357 Magnum]] revolver to the city post office with the intention of killing his postmaster. When he arrived at the parking lot, he reportedly ran over his supervisor several times. He then went into the post office looking for his postmaster. Not finding him, he went back out to the parking lot and shot his supervisor.&lt;ref name="bakerCity"&gt;http://www.bakercityherald.com/csp/mediapool/sites/BakerCityHerald/LocalNews/story.csp?cid=4122312&amp;sid=818&amp;fid=151&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaher was on a new route for three weeks and had felt pressured by a week-long work-time study and extra time added to his new route.&lt;ref name="bakerCity"/&gt;

On June 14, 2017, [[San Francisco UPS shooting#cite note-LAT-170615-1|Jimmy Lam]], 38, fatally shot three coworkers at a [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) facility in the [[Potrero Hill]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco, California]]. Lam then shot and killed himself as police arrived at the facility. Two others were wounded by gunfire, and three people were injured while escaping.

==Analysis==
Researchers have found that the homicide rates at postal facilities were lower than at other workplaces. In major industries, the highest rate of 2.1 homicides per 100,000 workers per year was in retail. The homicide rate for postal workers was 0.22 per 100,000 versus 0.77 per 100,000 workers in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps12068/33994.pdf Permanent.access.gpo.gov ''Report of The United States Postal Service Commission On A Safe And Secure Workplace'' August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The common depiction of an employee returning to work for revenge on his boss is overdone.  More than half of mass workplace shooting are by current employees, and a little under a quarter are by employees who have been at their job for less than a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1998, the [[United States Congress]] conducted a joint hearing to review the violence in the U.S. Postal Service. In the hearing, it was noted that despite the postal service accounting for less than 1% of the full-time civilian labor force, 13% of workplace homicides were committed at postal facilities by current or former employees.&lt;ref&gt;Musacco, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
In the controversial video game series ''[[Postal (video game series)|Postal]]'', the player takes on the role of an insane mass murderer in the first game, and in the later series a first-person role performing normally mundane chores (such as picking up a paycheck from work) with an often gratuitously violent twist.  In 1997, the USPS sued the creators of the game, [[Running With Scissors (company)|Running With Scissors]], over the use of the term "postal".  Running With Scissors argued that, despite its title, the game has absolutely nothing to do with the USPS or its employees. The case was dismissed [[Prejudice (legal term)|with prejudice]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Justin|title=Postal court case dismissed|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-court-case-dismissed/1100-6030580/|accessdate=25 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 comedy film ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' includes a scene where the main character must deal with a series of escalating threats, including the sudden appearance of dozens of disgruntled postal workers randomly firing weapons in every direction.

The 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' is credited with popularizing the phrase "going postal" and is responsible for the term's casual usage still today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skeels|first=Virginia|title=The cast of Clueless reunites|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2213701/The-cast-Clueless-reunites-remembering-Brittany-Murphy.html|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors in the film had no idea what it meant to "go postal," since it was an uncommon phrase at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first=Nico|title=25 Little-Known Facts About Clueless|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2012/11/25-little-known-facts-about-clueless/|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the 2004 book ''[[Going Postal]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]] makes reference to the contents of the novel, but in future novels of the [[Discworld]] universe characters use the term "going postal" in the common sense, apparently referring to the events of ''Going Postal''.

As referenced on the Simpsons, during Episode "Sunday Cruddy Sunday", Bart and Lisa visit the post office and Nelson asks:
* '''Nelson:''' Have you ever gone on a killing spree?
* '''Postmaster Bill:''' (laughing) Ho ho ho, nooo noo, the day of the gun toting disgruntled postman shooting up the place went out with the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]].

In the ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' episode ''[[USPIS (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|USPIS]]'', a self-righteous [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] agent passionate about his job is adamant that "going postal" is the term most associated with bringing goodness into people's lives, which is a view also shared by his co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-season-2-ed-helms-uspis.html|access-date=August 7, 2018|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine Recap: Going Postal|first=Allie|last=Pape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hedone''' was the personification and goddess of pleasure, enjoyment, and delight. Hedone, also known as [[Voluptas]] in Roman mythology, is the daughter of the Greek gods [[Eros]] (Cupid) and [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]]. She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure. Her opposites were the [[Algos]], personifications of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedone|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hedone.html|website=Theoi Greek Mythology|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hēdonē'' ({{lang|grc|ἡδονή}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning [[pleasure]], and is the root of the English word "[[wikt:hedonism|hedonism]]". In the [[Epicureanism|philosophy]] of [[Epicurus]], hēdonē is described as a pleasure that may or may not derive from actions that are virtuous, whereas another form of pleasure, ''terpsis'', is always virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=James|title=Epicurus and Democritean ethics : an archaeology of ataraxia|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

It is also known as '''Damas–Milner''' or '''Damas–Hindley–Milner'''. It was first described by [[J. Roger Hindley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = J. Roger Hindley | first = J.

Among HM's more notable properties are its completeness and its ability to infer the [[principal type|most general type]] of a given program without programmer-supplied [[type annotation]]s or other hints. [[#Algorithm W|Algorithm W]] is an efficient [[type inference]] method that performs in almost [[linear time]] with respect to the size of the source, making it practically useful to type large programs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hindley–Milner is [[DEXPTIME]]-complete. Non-linear behaviour does manifest itself, yet only on [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] inputs. Thus the complexity theoretic proofs by {{harvtxt|Mairson|1990}} and {{harvtxt|Kfoury|Tiuryn|Urzyczyn|1990}} came as a surprise to the research community. When the depth of nested let-bindings is bounded—which is the case in realistic programs—Hindley–Milner type inference becomes polynomial.&lt;/ref&gt; HM is preferably used for [[functional language]]s. It was first implemented as part of the type system of the programming language [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Since then, HM has been extended in various ways, most notably with [[type class]] constraints like those in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

==Introduction==

{{main|Type system}}

One and the same thing can be used for many purposes.  A [[chair]] might be used to support a sitting person but also as a [[ladder]] to stand on while changing a light bulb or as a [[clothes valet]]. Beside having particular material qualities, which make a chair usable as such, it also has the particular designation for its use. When no chair is at hand, other things might be used as a seat, and so the designation of a thing can be changed as fast as one can turn an empty bottle crate upside down to change its purpose from a container to that of a support.

Different uses of physically near-identical things are usually accompanied by giving those things different names to emphasize the intended purpose. Depending on the use, seamen have a dozen or more words for a [[rope]] though it might materially be the same thing. The same in everyday language, where a [[leash]] indicates a use different to a [[clothes line|line]].

In computer science, this practice of naming things by its intended use is put to an extreme called ''typing'' and the names or expressions called ''types'':

* Contrary to the richly varying raw materials in the physical world, computing has only one raw material, bytes, and much like letters in a book they are used to build up and express everything in a computer's memory.
* Programmers not only have many words indicating the different uses for bytes, but rather a plethora of formal ''type'' ''languages'', each having their own grammar.
* There are branches of research in computer science and mathematics dedicated to developing and enhancing such languages. Their theoretical foundations have [[type systems]] and [[type theory]] as their subjects.
* Types are not only used in specifications and documentations, but are also an integral part of programming languages. There, they are mechanised to strongly support the programmers' tasks.

Beside structuring objects, (data) types serve as means to validate that these objects are used as intended. Much like a crate that could only be used as a support or a container at a time, a particular arrangement of bytes designated for one purpose might exclude other possible uses.

In programming, these uses are expressed as ''functions'' or ''procedures'' which serve the role of verbs in [[natural language]]. As an example for typing verbs, an English dictionary might define ''gift'' as "to give so. sth.", indicating that the object must be a person and the indirect object a physical thing. In programming, "so." (someone) and "sth." (something) would be called types and using a thing into the place of "so." would be indicated as a programming error by a [[type checker]].

Beside checking, one can use the types in this example to gain knowledge about an unknown word. Reading the sentence "Mary gifts John a bilber" the types could be used to conclude that a "bilber" is likely a physical thing. This activity and conclusion is called ''type inference''. As the story unfolds, more and more information about the unknown "bilber" may be gained, and eventually enough details become known to form a complete image of that kind of thing.

The type inference method designed by [[J. Roger Hindley|Hindley]] and [[Robin Milner|Milner]] does just this for programming languages. The advantage of type inference over type checking is that it allows a more natural and dense style of programming. Instead of starting a program text with a glossary defining what a bilber and everything else is, one can distribute this information over the text simply by using the yet undefined words and let a program collect all the details about them. The method works for both nouns (data types) and for verbs (functions types).  As a consequence, a programmer can proceed without ever mentioning types at all, while still having the full support of a type checker that validates their writing. When reading a program, the programmer can use type inference to query the full definition of anything named in the program whenever needed.

=== History of type inference ===
Historically, type inference to this extent was developed for a particular group of programming languages, called [[functional languages]]. These started in 1958 with [[Lisp]], a programming language based on the [[lambda calculus]] and that compares well with modern [[scripting languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. Lisp was mainly used for computer science research, often for symbol manipulation purposes where large, tree-like data structures were common.

Data in Lisp is [[dynamic type|dynamically typed]] and the types are only available to some degree while running a program. Debugging type errors was no less of a concern than it is with modern script languages. But, being completely untyped, i.e. written without any explicit type information, maintaining large programs written in Lisp soon became a problem because the many complicated types of the data were mentioned only in the program documentation and comments at best.

Thus, the need to have a Lisp-like language with machine-checkable types became more and more pressing. At some point, programming language development faced two challenges:

# [[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]. Some kinds of data are very generic. In particular, Lisp is a "list programming language" where lists are data whose type can be a "list of something", e.g. a list of numbers.  Functions for such generic data types are often themselves generic. For instance, counting the number of items on a list is independent of the type of its items. However, a generic function that adds another item to a given list, needs type checking to ensure that the list will remain consistent with respect to the type of its items. For example, that only numbers may be added to a list of numbers.  Types for such "generic" data and functions are called ''polymorphic'', meaning that they can be used for more than one type. The polymorphic function for adding an item can be used for a list of numbers as well as for a list of words or even a list of anything. More precisely, this kind of polymorphism is called [[parametric polymorphism]], where "something" is the parameter in "list of something".  More formally, "list of something" may be written &lt;code&gt;List T&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; being the type parameter. The type of a function that adds a new item to a list is &lt;code&gt;forall T . T -&gt; List T -&gt; List T&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that for any and all types T the adding function needs an item of type T and a list-of-Ts, to produce a resulting (new) list-of-Ts.  Thus, the first challenge was, to design a type system that properly expressed parametric polymorphism.
# [[Type inference]]. Unfortunately, polymorphic functions requiring type checking must be continuously informed of the types. The above function would need the type T as an additional first parameter, resulting in program text so cluttered with type information that it becomes unreadable. Additionally, when keying in a program, a programmer would spend a significant portion of time keying in types.

As an example, polymorphically constructing the list "(1 2)" of two numbers would mean writing:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (addItem Number 1 (addItem Number 2 (emptyList Number)))
&lt;/source&gt;

This example was quite typical. Every third word a type, monotonously serving the type checker in every step. This worsens when the types become more complex. Then, the methods to be expressed in code become buried in types.

To handle this issue, effective methods for type inference were the subject of research, and Hindley-Milner's method was one of them. Their method was first used in [[ML (programming language)|ML]] (1973) and is also used in an extended form in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (1990). The HM type inference method is strong enough to infer types not only for expressions, but for whole programs including the procedures and local definitions, providing a type-less style of programming.

The following text gives an impression of the resulting programming style for the [[quicksort]] procedure in Haskell:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
quickSort []     = []                           -- Sort an empty list
quickSort (x:xs) = quickSort (filter (&lt;x) xs)   -- Sort the left part of the list
                   ++ [x] ++                    -- Insert pivot between two sorted parts
                   quickSort (filter (&gt;=x) xs)  -- Sort the right part of the list
&lt;/source&gt;

Though all of the functions in the above example need type parameters, types are nowhere mentioned. The code is statically type-checked even though the type of the function defined is unknown and must be inferred to type-check the applications in the body.

Over the years, other programming languages added their own version of parametric types. [[C++]] templates were introduced in 1998 and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] introduced [[Generics in Java|generics]] in 2004. As programming with type parameters became more common, problems similar to the ones sketched for Lisp surfaced in [[imperative programming|imperative languages]] too, perhaps not as pressing as it was for the functional languages. As a consequence, these languages obtained support for some type inference techniques, for instance "auto" in [[C++11#Type inference|C++11]] (2014). Unfortunately, the stronger type inference methods developed for functional programming cannot simply be integrated in the imperative languages, as their type systems' features are in part incompatible, and a programming language must be designed from the ground up when continuous type inference is wanted.

== Features of the Hindley–Milner method ==

Before presenting the HM type system and related algorithms, the following sections make some features of HM more formal and precise.

===Type-checking vs. type-inference===

In a typing, an expression E is opposed to a type T, formally written as E : T. Usually a typing only makes sense within some context, which is omitted here.

In this setting, the following questions are of particular interest:

# E : T? In this case, both an expression E and a type T are given. Now, is E really a T? This scenario is known as [[type-checking]].
# E : _? Here, only the expression is known. So, what type is E? If there is a way to derive a type for E, then we have accomplished [[type inference]].
# _ : T? The other way round. Given only a type, is there any expression for it or does the type have no values? Is there any example of a T? And in light of the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]], is there a proof for T?

For the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], all three questions are decidable. The situation is not as comfortable when more expressive types are allowed. Additionally, the simply typed lambda calculus makes the types of the parameters of each function explicit, while they are not needed in HM. While HM is a method for type inference, it can be used also for type checking and answer the first question. To do that, a type is first inferred from E and then compared with the type wanted. The third question becomes of interest when looking at recursively-defined functions at the end of this article.

===Monomorphism vs. polymorphism===

{{main|parametric polymorphism}}

In the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], types &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are either atomic type constants or function types of form &lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt;.  Such types are ''monomorphic''. Typical examples are the types used in arithmetic values:

  3       : Number
  add 3 4 : Number
  add     : Number -&gt; Number -&gt; Number

Contrary to this, the untyped lambda calculus is neutral to typing at all, and many of its functions can be meaningfully applied to all type of arguments. The trivial example is the identity function

:id &lt;math&gt;\equiv \lambda&lt;/math&gt; x . x

which simply returns whatever value it is applied to. Less trivial examples include parametric types like lists.

While polymorphism in general means that operations accept values of more than one type, the polymorphism used here is parametric. One finds the notation of ''type schemes'' in the literature, too, emphasizing the parametric nature of the polymorphism. Additionally, constants may be typed with (quantified) type variables. E.g.:

  cons : forall a . a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a
  nil  : forall a . List a.
  id   : forall a . a -&gt; a

Polymorphic types can become monomorphic by consistent substitution of their variables. Examples of monomorphic ''instances'' are:

 id'  : String -&gt; String
 nil' : List Number

More generally, types are polymorphic when they contain type variables, while types without them are monomorphic.

Contrary to the type systems used for example in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (1970) or [[C (programming language)|C]] (1972), which only support monomorphic types, HM is designed with emphasis on parametric polymorphism. The successors of the languages mentioned, like [[C++]] (1985), focused on different types of polymorphism, namely [[Polymorphism (computer science)#Subtyping|subtyping]] in connection with object-oriented programming and [[Polymorphism (computer science)#Ad hoc polymorphism|overloading]]. While subtyping is incompatible with HM, a variant of systematic overloading is available in the HM-based type system of Haskell.

===Let-polymorphism===

When extending the simply-typed lambda calculus towards polymorphism, one has to define when deriving an instance of a value is admissible. Ideally, this would be allowed with any use of a bound variable, as in:

  (λ id .  ... (id 3) ... (id "text") ... ) (λ x . x)

Unfortunately, type inference in such a system is not decidable.{{Citation needed|reasoning=Not obvious, under what rules.|date=November 2018}} Instead, HM provides ''let-polymorphism'' of the form

  '''let''' id = λ x . x
   '''in''' ... (id 3) ... (id "text") ...

restricting the binding mechanism in an extension of the expression syntax. Only values bound in a let construct are subject to instantiation, i.e. are polymorphic, while the parameters in lambda-abstractions are treated as being monomorphic.

==Overview==

The remainder of the article is more technical as it has to present the HM method as it is handled in the literature. It proceeds as follows:

* The HM type system is defined. This is done by describing a deduction system that makes precise what expressions have what type, if any.
* From there, it works towards an implementation of the type inference method. After introducing a syntax driven variant of the above deductive system, it sketches an efficient implementation (algorithm J), appealing mostly to the reader's metalogical intuition.
* Because it remains open whether algorithm J indeed realises the initial deduction system, a less efficient implementation (algorithm W), is introduced and its use in a proof is hinted.
* Finally, further topics related to the algorithm are discussed.

The same description of the deduction system is used throughout, even for the two algorithms, to make the various forms in which the HM method is presented directly comparable.

== The Hindley–Milner type system ==

The type system can be formally described by [[Formal grammar|syntax rules]] that fix a language for the expressions, types, etc. The presentation here of such a syntax is not too formal, in that it is written down not to study the [[Parse tree|surface grammar]], but rather the [[Abstract syntax|depth grammar]], and leaves some syntactical details open. This form of presentation is usual. Building on this, [[type rule]]s are used to define how expressions and types are related. As before, the form used is a bit liberal.

The expressions to be typed are exactly those of the [[lambda calculus]] extended with a let-expression as shown in the adjacent table. Parentheses can be used to disambiguate an expression. The application is left-binding and binds stronger than abstraction or the let-in construct.

Types are syntactically split into two groups, monotypes and polytypes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Polytypes are called "type schemes" in the original article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monotypes ====
Monotypes always designate a particular type. Monotypes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are syntactically represented as [[Term (logic)|terms]].

Examples of monotypes include type constants like &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{string}&lt;/math&gt;, and parametric types like &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{Map\ (Set\ string)\ int}&lt;/math&gt;.   The later types are examples of ''applications'' of type functions, for example, from the set
&lt;math&gt; \{ \mathtt{Map^2,\ Set^1,\ string^0,\ int^0},\ \rightarrow^2 \} &lt;/math&gt;, 
where the superscript indicates the number of type parameters.  The complete set of type functions &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary in HM,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The parametric types &lt;math&gt;C\ \tau\dots\tau&lt;/math&gt; were not present in the original paper on HM and are not needed to present the method. None of the inference rules below will take care or even note them. The same holds for the non-parametric "primitive types" in said paper. All the machinery for polymorphic type inference can be defined without them. They have been included here for sake of examples but also because the nature of HM is all about parametric types. This comes from the function type &lt;math&gt;\tau\rightarrow\tau&lt;/math&gt;, hard-wired in the inference rules, below, which already has two parameters and has been presented here as only a special case.&lt;/ref&gt; except that it ''must'' contain at least &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow^2&lt;/math&gt;, the type of functions.  It is often written in infix notation for convenience.  For example, a function mapping integers to strings has type &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int}\rightarrow \mathtt{string}&lt;/math&gt;. Again, parentheses can be used to disambiguate a type expression. The application binds stronger than the infix arrow, which is right-binding.

Type variables are admitted as monotypes. Monotypes are not to be confused with monomorphic types, which exclude variables and allow only ground terms.

Two monotypes are equal if they have identical terms.

==== Polytypes ====
''Polytypes'' (or ''type schemes'') are types containing variables bound by one or more for-all quantifiers, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

A function with polytype &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can map ''any'' value of the same type to itself,
and the [[identity function]] is a value for this type.

As another example &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.(\mathtt{Set}\ \alpha)\rightarrow \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of a function mapping all finite sets to integers. A function which returns the [[cardinality]] of a set would be a value of this type.

Note that quantifiers can only appear top level, i.e. a type &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\forall\alpha.\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for instance, is excluded by the syntax of types. Note also that monotypes are included in the polytypes, thus a type has the general form &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha_1\dots\forall\alpha_n.\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a monotype.

Equality of polytypes is up to reordering the quantification and renaming the quantified variables (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-conversion). Further, quantified variables not occurring in the monotype can be dropped.

==== Context and Typing ====

To meaningfully bring together the still disjoint parts (syntax expressions and types) a third part is needed: context. Syntactically, a context is a list of pairs &lt;math&gt;x:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignments]], [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] or [[Name binding|bindings]], each pair stating that value variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;. All three parts combined give a ''typing judgment'' of the form &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\ \vdash\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
stating that under assumptions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Free type variables ====

In a type &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha_1\dots\forall\alpha_n.\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; is the quantifier binding the type variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; in the monotype &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are called ''quantified'' and any occurrence of a quantified type variable in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called ''bound'' and all unbound type variables in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are called ''free''. Additionally to the quantification &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; in polytypes, type variables can also be bound by occurring in the context, but with the inverse effect on the right hand side of the &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;. Such variables then behave like type constants there. Finally, a type variable may legally occur unbound in a typing, in which case they are implicitly all-quantified.

The presence of both bound and unbound type variables is a bit uncommon in programming languages. Often, all type variables are implicitly treated all-quantified. For instance, one does not have clauses with free variables in [[Prolog]]. Likely in Haskell, in the absence of the ScopedTypeVariables language extension, all type variables implicitly occur quantified, i.e. a Haskell type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; here.

=== Type order ===
{{main|Unification (computer science)#Substitution}}

Polymorphism means that one and the same expression can have (perhaps
infinitely) many types. But in this type system, these types are not completely
unrelated, but rather orchestrated by the parametric polymorphism.

As an example, the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x . x&lt;/math&gt; can have &lt;math&gt;\forall
\alpha . \alpha \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt; as its type as well as
&lt;math&gt;\texttt{string} \rightarrow \texttt{string}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\texttt{int}
\rightarrow \texttt{int}&lt;/math&gt; and many others, but not &lt;math&gt;\texttt{int}
\rightarrow \texttt{string}&lt;/math&gt;. The most general type for this function is
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha\rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, while the
others are more specific and can be derived from the general one by consistently
replacing another type for the ''type parameter'', i.e. the quantified
variable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The counter-example fails because the
replacement is not consistent.

The consistent replacement can be made formal by applying a [[Unification (computer science)#Substitution|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;S = \left\{\ a_i \mapsto \tau_i,\ \dots\ \right\}&lt;/math&gt; to the term of a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;S\tau&lt;/math&gt;. As the example suggests, substitution is not only strongly related to an order, that expresses that a type is more or less special, but also with the all-quantification which allows the substitution to be applied.

{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Specialization Rule'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\tau' = \left\{\alpha_i \mapsto \tau_i\right\} \tau \quad \beta_i \not\in \textrm{free}(\forall \alpha_1...\forall\alpha_n . \tau)}{\forall \alpha_1...\forall\alpha_n . \tau \sqsubseteq \forall \beta_1...\forall\beta_m . \tau'}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Formally, in HM, a type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is 
more general than &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, formally &lt;math&gt;\sigma \sqsubseteq
\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; if some quantified variable in &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is
consistently substituted such that one gains &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; as shown in the side bar.
This order is part of the type definition of the type system.

While substituting a monomorphic (ground) type for a quantified variable is
straight forward, substituting a polytype has some pitfalls caused by the
presence of free variables. Most particularly, unbound variables must not be
replaced. They are treated as constants here. Additionally, note
that quantifications can only occur top-level. Substituting a parametric type,
one has to lift its quantors. The table on the right makes the rule precise.

Alternatively, consider an equivalent notation for the polytypes without
quantors in which quantified variables are represented by a different set of
symbols. In such a notation, the specialization reduces to plain consistent
replacement of such variables.

The relation &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]]
and  &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is its smallest element.

==== Principal type ====
While specialization of a type scheme is one use of the order, it plays a
crucial second role in the type system. Type inference with polymorphism
faces the challenge of summarizing all possible types an expression may have.
The order guarantees that such a summary exists as the most general type
of the expression.

==== Substitution in typings ====

The type order defined above can be extended to typings because the implied all-quantification of typings enables consistent replacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma \quad\Longrightarrow\quad S\Gamma \vdash e : S\sigma
&lt;/math&gt;
Contrary to the specialisation rule, this is not part of the definition, but like the implicit all-quantification rather a consequence of the type rules defined next.
Free type variables in a typing serve as placeholders for possible refinement. The binding effect of the environment to free type
variables on the right hand side of &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; that prohibits their substitution in the specialisation rule is again
that a replacement has to be consistent and would need to include the whole typing.

=== Deductive system ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''The Syntax of Rules'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lrl}
  \text{Predicate}  &amp; =      &amp;\sigma\sqsubseteq\sigma'\\
                    &amp; \vert\ &amp;\alpha\not\in free(\Gamma)\\
                    &amp; \vert\ &amp;x:\alpha\in \Gamma\\
\\
  \text{Judgment}   &amp; =      &amp;\text{Typing}\\
  \text{Premise}    &amp; =      &amp;\text{Judgment}\ \vert\ \text{Predicate}\\
  \text{Conclusion} &amp; =      &amp;\text{Judgment}\\
\\
  \text{Rule}       &amp; =      &amp;\displaystyle\frac{\textrm{Premise}\ \dots}{\textrm{Conclusion}}\quad [\mathtt{Name}]
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The syntax of HM is carried forward to the syntax of the [[Rule of inference|inference rules]] that form the body of the [[formal system]], by using the typings as [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgments]]. Each of the rules define what conclusion could be drawn from what premises. Additionally to the judgments, some extra conditions introduced above might be used as premises, too.

A proof using the rules is a sequence of judgments such that all premises are listed before a conclusion. The examples below show a possible format of proofs. From left to right, each line shows the conclusion, the &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Name}]&lt;/math&gt; of the rule applied and the premises, either by referring to an earlier line (number) if the premise is a judgment or by making the predicate explicit.

==== Typing rules ====
{{see also|Type rules}}
{| class=infobox

| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{cl}

 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The side box shows the deduction rules of the HM type system. One can roughly divide the rules into two groups:

The first four rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt; (variable or function access), &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{App}]&lt;/math&gt; (''application'', i.e. function call with one parameter), &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; (''abstraction'', i.e. function declaration) and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; (variable declaration) are centered around the syntax, presenting one rule for each of the expression forms. Their meaning is obvious at the first glance, as they decompose each expression, prove their sub-expressions and finally combine the individual types found in the premises to the type in the conclusion.

The second group is formed by the  remaining two rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;.
They handle specialization and generalization of types. While the rule &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; should be clear from the section on specialization above, &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt; complements the former, working in the opposite direction. It allows generalization, i.e. to quantify monotype variables not bound in the context.
 
The following two examples exercise the rule system in action. Since both the expression and the type are given, they are a type-checking use of the rules.

'''Example''': A proof for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D id(n):int&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = id:\forall \alpha . \alpha\rightarrow\alpha,\ n:int&lt;/math&gt;,
could be written

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{llll}
1:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id : \forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha  &amp;[\mathtt{Var}]&amp; (id : \forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha \in \Gamma) \\
2:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id : int \rightarrow int &amp; [\mathtt{Inst}]&amp;(1),\ (\forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha \sqsubseteq int\rightarrow int)\\

4:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id(n) : int&amp;[\mathtt{App}]&amp; (2),\ (3)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''': To demonstrate generalization,
&lt;math&gt;\vdash_D\ \textbf{let}\, id = \lambda x . x\ \textbf{in}\ id\, :\, \forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
is shown below:

3: &amp; \vdash_D \lambda x.x : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Gen}] &amp; (2),\ (\alpha \not\in free(\epsilon))\\

5: &amp; \vdash_D \textbf{let}\, id = \lambda x . x\ \textbf{in}\  id\, :\,\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha  &amp; [\mathtt{Let}] &amp; (3),\ (4)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Let-polymorphism ===
Not visible immediately, the rule set encodes a regulation under which circumstances a type might be generalized or not by a slightly varying use of mono- and polytypes in the rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt;. Remember that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; denote poly- and monotypes respectively.

In rule &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt;, the value variable of the parameter of the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.e&lt;/math&gt; is added to the context with a monomorphic type through the premise &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\ x:\tau \vdash_D e:\tau'&lt;/math&gt;, while in the rule  &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt;, the variable enters the environment in polymorphic form &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\ x:\sigma \vdash_D e_1:\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Though in both cases the presence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the context prevents the use of the generalisation rule for any free variable in the assignment, this regulation forces the type of parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-expression to remain monomorphic, while in a let-expression, the variable could be introduced polymorphic, making specializations possible.

As a consequence of this regulation, &lt;math&gt;\lambda f.(f\, \textrm{true}, f\, \textrm{0})&lt;/math&gt; cannot be typed,
since the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in a monomorphic position, while &lt;math&gt;\textbf{let}\ f = \lambda x . x\, \textbf{in}\, (f\, \textrm{true}, f\, \textrm{0})&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;(bool, int)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has been introduced in a let-expression and is treated polymorphic therefore.

===Generalization rule===

The generalisation rule is also worth for closer look. Here, the all-quantification implicit in the premise &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is simply moved to the right hand side of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; in the conclusion. This is possible, since &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; does not occur free in the context. Again, while this makes the generalisation rule plausible, it is not really a consequence. Vis versa, the generalisation rule is part of the definition of HM's type system and the implicit all-quantification a consequence.

== An inference algorithm ==
Now that the deduction system of HM is at hand, one could present an algorithm and validate it with respect to the rules.
Alternatively, it might be possible to derive it by taking a closer look on how the rules interact and proof are
formed. This is done in the remainder of this article focusing on the possible decisions one can make while proving a typing.

=== Degrees of freedom choosing the rules ===
Isolating the points in a proof, where no decision is possible at all,
the first group of rules centered around the syntax leaves no choice since
to each syntactical rule corresponds a unique typing rule, which determines
a part of the proof, while between the conclusion and the premises of these
fixed parts chains of &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;
could occur. Such a chain could also exist between the conclusion of the
proof and the rule for topmost expression. All proofs must have
the so sketched shape.

Because the only choice in a proof with respect of rule selection are the
&lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt; chains, the
form of the proof suggests the question whether it can be made more precise,
where these chains might be needed. This is in fact possible and leads to a
variant of the rules system with no such rules.

A contemporary treatment of HM uses a purely [[syntax-directed]] rule system due to
Clement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Clement | date = 1986 | title = A Simple Applicative Language: Mini-ML | conference = LFP'86 | publisher = ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as an intermediate step. In this system, the specialization is located directly after the original &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt; rule
and merged into it, while the generalization becomes part of the &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; rule. There the generalization is
also determined to always produce the most general type by introducing the function &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, which quantifies
all monotype variables not bound in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, to validate, that this new rule system &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the original &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt;, one has
to show that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Leftrightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, which falls apart into two sub-proofs:

* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Leftarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Consistency]])
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]])

While consistency can be seen by decomposing the rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; into proofs in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt;, it is likely visible that &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; is incomplete, as
one cannot show &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.x:\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, but only
&lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.x:\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  An only slightly weaker version of completeness is provable
&lt;ref name=x&gt;{{cite journal | first = Jeff | last = Vaughan | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120324105848/http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~jeff/docs/hmproof.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-24 | url = http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~jeff/docs/hmproof.pdf | title = A proof of correctness for the Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm | origyear = May 5, 2005 | date = July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though, namely

* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\tau \wedge \bar{\Gamma}(\tau)\sqsubseteq\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

implying, one can derive the principal type for an expression in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; allowing us to generalize the proof in the end.

Comparing &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, note that now only monotypes appear in the judgments of all rules. Additionally, the shape of any possible proof with the deduction system is now identical to the shape of the expression (both seen as [[Term (logic)#Formal definition|trees]]). Thus the expression fully determines the shape of the proof. In &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; the shape would likely be determined with respect to all rules except &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;, which allow building arbitrarily long branches (chains) between the other nodes.

=== Degrees of freedom instantiating the rules ===

Now that the shape of the proof is known, one is already close to formulating a type inference algorithm.
Because any proof for a given expression must have the same shape, one can assume the monotypes in the
proof's judgements to be undetermined and consider how to determine them.

Here, the substitution (specialisation) order comes into play. Although at the first glance one cannot determine the types locally, the hope is that it is possible to refine them with the help of the order while traversing the proof tree, additionally assuming, because the resulting algorithm is to become an inference method, that the type in any premise will be determined as the best possible. And in fact, one can, as looking at the rules of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; suggests:

* &lt;math&gt;[Abs]&lt;/math&gt;: The critical choice is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. At this point, nothing is known about &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, so one can only assume the most general type, which is &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The plan is to specialize the type if it should become necessary. Unfortunately, a polytype is not permitted in this place, so some &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has to do for the moment. To avoid unwanted captures, a type variable not yet in the proof is a safe choice. Additionally, one has to keep in mind that this monotype is not yet fixed, but might be further refined.
* &lt;math&gt;[Var]&lt;/math&gt;: The choice is how to refine &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Because any choice of a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; here depends on the usage of the variable, which is not locally known, the safest bet is the most general one. Using the same method as above one can instantiate all quantified variables in &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; with fresh monotype variables, again keeping them open to further refinement.
* &lt;math&gt;[Let]&lt;/math&gt;: The rule does not leave any choice. Done.
* &lt;math&gt;[App]&lt;/math&gt;: Only the application rule might force a refinement to the variables "opened" so far.

The first premise forces the outcome of the inference to be of the form &lt;math&gt;\tau \rightarrow \tau'&lt;/math&gt;.
* If it is, then fine. One can later pick its &lt;math&gt;\tau'&lt;/math&gt; for the result.
* If not, it might be an open variable. Then this can be refined to the required form with two new variables as before.
* Otherwise, the type checking fails because the first premise inferred a type which is not and cannot be made into a function type.

The second premise requires that the inferred type is equal to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the first premise. Now there are two possibly different types, perhaps with open type variables, at hand to compare and to make equal if it is possible. If it is, a refinement is found, and if not, a type error is detected again. An effective method is known to "make two terms equal" by substitution, [[John Alan Robinson|Robinson's]] [[Unification (computing)|Unification]] in combination with the so-called [[Disjoint-set data structure|Union-Find]] algorithm.

To briefly summarize the union-find algorithm, given the set of all types in a proof, it allows one to group them together into [[equivalence class]]es by means of a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{union}&lt;/math&gt;
procedure and to pick a representative for each such class using a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{find}&lt;/math&gt; procedure. Emphasizing the word [[Procedure (computer science)|procedure]] in the sense of [[Side effect (computer science)|side effect]], we're clearly leaving the realm of logic in order to prepare an effective algorithm. The representative of a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{union}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is determined such that, if both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are type variables then the representative is arbitrarily one of them, but while uniting a variable and a term, the term becomes the representative. Assuming an implementation of union-find at hand, one can formulate the unification of two monotypes as follows:

 unify(ta,tb):
   ta = find(ta)
   tb = find(tb)
   '''if''' both ta,tb are terms of the form D p1..pn with identical D,n '''then'''
     unify(ta[i],tb[i]) for each corresponding ''i''th parameter
   '''else'''
   '''if''' at least one of ta,tb is a type variable '''then'''
     union(ta,tb)
   '''else'''
     error 'types do not match'

Now having a sketch of an inference algorithm at hand, a more formal presentation is given in the next section. It is described in Milner&lt;ref name="Milner"/&gt; P. 370 ff. as algorithm J.

=== Algorithm J ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Algorithm J'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{cl}
\displaystyle\frac{x:\sigma \in \Gamma \quad \tau = \mathit{inst}(\sigma)}{\Gamma \vdash_J x:\tau}&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\Gamma \vdash_J e_0:\tau_0 \quad \Gamma \vdash_J e_1 : \tau_1 \quad \tau'=\mathit{newvar} \quad \mathit{unify}(\tau_0,\ \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau') }{\Gamma \vdash_J e_0\ e_1 : \tau'}&amp;[\mathtt{App}]\\ \\

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The presentation of Algorithm J is a misuse of the notation of logical rules, since it includes side effects but allows a direct comparison with &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; while expressing an efficient implementation at the same time. The rules now specify a procedure with parameters &lt;math&gt;\Gamma, e&lt;/math&gt; yielding &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in the conclusion where the execution of the premises proceeds from left to right.

The procedure &lt;math&gt;inst(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; specializes the polytype &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; by copying the term and replacing the bound type variables consistently by new monotype variables. '&lt;math&gt;newvar&lt;/math&gt;' produces a new monotype variable. Likely, &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; has to copy the type introducing new variables for the quantification to avoid unwanted captures. Overall, the algorithm now proceeds by always making the most general choice leaving the specialization to the unification, which by itself produces the most general result. As noted [[#Syntax driven Rule System|above]], the final result &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; has to be generalized to &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; in the end, to gain the most general type for a given expression.

Because the procedures used in the algorithm have nearly O(1) cost, the overall cost of the algorithm is close to linear in the size of the expression for which a type is to be inferred. This is in strong contrast to many other attempts to derive type inference algorithms, which often came out to be [[NP-hard]], if not [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] with respect to termination. Thus the HM performs as well as the best fully informed type-checking algorithms can. Type-checking here means that an algorithm does not have to find a proof, but only to validate a given one.

Efficiency is slightly reduced because the binding of type variables in the context has to be maintained to allow computation of &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and enable an [[occurs check]] to prevent the building of recursive types during &lt;math&gt;union(\alpha,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.
An example of such a case is &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.(x\ x)&lt;/math&gt;, for which no type can be derived using HM.  Practically, types are only small terms and do not build up expanding structures.  Thus, in complexity analysis, one can treat comparing them as a constant, retaining O(1) costs.

==Proving the algorithm==

In the previous section, while sketching the algorithm its proof was hinted at with metalogical argumentation.  While this leads to an efficient algorithm J, it is
not clear whether the algorithm properly reflects the deduction systems D or S
which serve as a semantic base line.

The most critical point in the above argumentation is the refinement of monotype
variables bound by the context. For instance, the algorithm boldly changes the
context while inferring e.g. &lt;math&gt;\lambda f . (f\ 1)&lt;/math&gt;,
because the monotype variable added to the context for the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; later needs to be refined
to &lt;math&gt;int \rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; when handling application.
The problem is that the deduction rules do not allow such a refinement.
Arguing that the refined type could have been added earlier instead of the
monotype variable is an expedient at best.

The key to reaching a formally satisfying argument is to properly include
the context within the refinement. Formally,
typing is compatible with substitution of free type variables.

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_S e : \tau \quad\Longrightarrow\quad S \Gamma \vdash_S e : S \tau&lt;/math&gt;

To refine the free variables thus means to refine the whole typing.

=== Algorithm W ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Algorithm W'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{cl}
\displaystyle\frac{x:\sigma \in \Gamma \quad \tau = \mathit{inst}(\sigma)}{\Gamma \vdash_W x:\tau,\emptyset}&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\begin{array}{ll}\Gamma \vdash_W e_0 : \tau_0, S_0 &amp; S_0 \Gamma \vdash_W e_1 : \tau_1, S_1\\ \tau'=\mathit{newvar} &amp; S_2 = \mathsf{mgu}(S_1 \tau_0,\ \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau')\end{array} }{\Gamma \vdash_W e_0\ e_1 : S_2 \tau', S_2 S_1 S_0}&amp;[\mathtt{App}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\tau = \mathit{newvar} \quad \Gamma,\;x:\tau\vdash_W e:\tau',S}{\Gamma \vdash_W \lambda\ x\ .\ e : S\tau \rightarrow \tau',S}&amp;[\mathtt{Abs}]\\ \\

\end{array}

&lt;/math&gt;
|}
From there, a proof of algorithm J leads to algorithm W, which only makes the
side effects imposed by the procedure &lt;math&gt;\textit{union}&lt;/math&gt; explicit by
expressing its serial composition by means of the substitutions
&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. The presentation of algorithm W in the sidebar still makes use of side effects
in the operations set in italic, but these are now limited to generating
fresh symbols. The form of judgement is &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e : \tau, S&lt;/math&gt;,
denoting a function with a context and expression as parameter producing a monotype together with
a substitution. &lt;math&gt;\textsf{mgu}&lt;/math&gt; is a side-effect free version
of &lt;math&gt;\textit{union}&lt;/math&gt; producing a substitution which is the [[Unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|most general unifier]].

While algorithm W is normally considered to be ''the'' HM algorithm and is
often directly presented after the rule system in literature, its purpose is
described by Milner&lt;ref name="Milner"/&gt; on P. 369 as follows:

: ''As it stands, W is hardly an efficient algorithm; substitutions are applied too often. It was formulated to aid the proof of soundness. We now present a simpler algorithm J which simulates W in a precise sense.''

While he considered W more complicated and less efficient, he presented it 
in his publication before J. It has its merits when side effects are unavailable or unwanted.
By the way, W is also needed to prove completeness, which is factored by him into the soundness proof.

=== Proof obligations ===

Before formulating the proof obligations, a deviation between the rules systems
D and S and the algorithms presented needs to be emphasized.

While the development above sort of misused the monotypes as "open" proof variables, the possibility that proper monotype variables might be harmed was sidestepped by introducing fresh variables and hoping for the best. But there's a catch: One of the promises made was that these fresh variables would be "kept in mind" as such. This promise is not fulfilled by the algorithm.

Having a context &lt;math&gt;1 : int,\ f : \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;f\ 1&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be typed in either &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, but the algorithms come up with
the type &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, where W additionally delivers the substitution &lt;math&gt;\left\{\alpha \mapsto int \rightarrow \beta\right\}&lt;/math&gt;,
meaning that the algorithm fails to detect all type errors. This omission can easily be fixed by more carefully distinguishing proof
variables and monotype variables.

The authors were well aware of the problem but decided not to fix it. One might assume a pragmatic reason behind this.
While more properly implementing the type inference would have enabled the algorithm to deal with abstract monotypes,
they were not needed for the intended application where none of the items in a preexisting context have free
variables. In this light, the unneeded complication was dropped in favor of a simpler algorithm.
The remaining downside is that the proof of the algorithm with respect to the rule system is less general and can only be made
for contexts with &lt;math&gt;free(\Gamma) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; as a side condition.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
\text{(Correctness)}  &amp;\Gamma |-_W e : \tau, S &amp;\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \Gamma \vdash_S e : \tau \\
\text{(Completeness)} &amp;\Gamma |-_S e : \tau   &amp;\quad\Longrightarrow\quad  \Gamma \vdash_W e : \tau', S \quad\quad \text{forall}\ \tau\ \text{where}\ \overline\emptyset(\tau') \sqsubseteq \tau
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The side condition in the completeness obligation addresses how the deduction may give many types, while the algorithm always produces one. At the same time, the side condition demands that the type inferred is actually the most general.

To properly prove the obligations one needs to strengthen them first to allow activating the substitution lemma threading the substitution &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash_W&lt;/math&gt;. From there, the proofs are by induction over the expression.

Another proof obligation is the substitution lemma itself, i.e. the substitution of the typing, which finally establishes the all-quantification. The later cannot formally be proven, since no such syntax is at hand.

== Extensions ==

=== Recursive definitions ===

To make [[Turing completeness|programming practical]] recursive functions are needed.
A central property of the lambda calculus is that recursive definitions
are not directly available, but can instead be expressed with a [[fixed point combinator]].
But unfortunately, the fixpoint combinator cannot be formulated in a typed version
of the lambda calculus without having a disastrous effect on the system as outlined
below.

==== Typing rule ====

The original paper&lt;ref name="Damas"/&gt; notes that recursion can be realized by a combinator
&lt;math&gt;\mathit{fix}:\forall\alpha.(\alpha\rightarrow\alpha)\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. A possible recursive definition could thus be formulated as
&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{rec}\ v = e_1\ \mathtt{in}\ e_2\ ::=\mathtt{let}\ v = \mathit{fix}(\lambda v.e_1)\ \mathtt{in}\ e_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively an extension of the expression syntax and an extra typing rule is possible:

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{
\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash e_1:\tau_1\quad\dots\quad\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash e_n:\tau_n\quad\Gamma, \Gamma'' \vdash e:\tau
}{
\Gamma\ \vdash\ \mathtt{rec}\ v_1 = e_1\ \mathtt{and}\ \dots\ \mathtt{and}\ v_n = e_n\ \mathtt{in}\ e:\tau
}\quad[\mathtt{Rec}]&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma' = v_1:\tau_1,\ \dots,\ v_n:\tau_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'' = v_1:\bar\Gamma(\ \tau_1\ ),\ \dots,\ v_n:\bar\Gamma(\ \tau_n\ )&lt;/math&gt;
basically merging &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; while including the recursively defined
variables in monotype positions where they occur to the left of the &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{in}&lt;/math&gt; but as polytypes to the right of it. This
formulation perhaps best summarizes the essence of [[#Let-polymorphism|let-polymorphism]].

==== Consequences ====

While the above is straightforward it does come at a price.

[[Type theory]] connects lambda calculus computation and logic.
The easy modification above has effects on both:

* The [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strong normalisation property]] is spoiled.
* The logic [[Consistency|collapses]].

Programs in simply typed lambda calculus are guaranteed to always terminate. Moreover, they
are even guaranteed to terminate under any evaluation strategy, be it top down, bottom up, breadth first, whatever. The same is true for expressions that have types in HM. It is well-known that separating
terminating from non-terminating programs is most difficult, and especially in lambda calculus,
which is so expressive that it can formulate recursion with just a few symbols. Thus the initial
inability of HM to provide recursive functions was not an omission, but a feature. Adding
recursion enables normal programming but the guarantee is not longer valid.

Another reading of the typing is given by the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]. Here
the types are interpreted as logical expressions. Let's look at the type of the fixpoint combinator from this
perspective, assuming the variables to have logical value:
: &lt;math&gt;
(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha  \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad 
\textsf{true} \rightarrow \alpha  \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad  \alpha
&lt;/math&gt;
But this is [[Validity (logic)|invalid]].
Adding an invalid axiom will break the logic in the sense that
every formula can then be shown to be true in it, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\text{true} \Leftrightarrow \text{false}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the ability to distinguish even two simple things is no longer given. Everything is the same and
collapses into [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]]. The fixpoint
combinator that came in so handy above also plays a role in [[Curry's paradox#Lambda calculus|Curry's paradox]].

Logic aside, does this matter for typing programs? It does. Since one is now able to formulate
non-terminating functions, one can make a function that would return whatever one wants&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
To make a function that works just like [[Aladdin]]'s wonderful lamp, one can define: &lt;math&gt;\text{iwisha} \equiv \text{fix id}&lt;/math&gt;
and formulate the wish in a slightly more expressive type language like: "(iwisha ([[flying carpet]]))" passing the type explicitly as
in the introduction. When the function returns, it delivers the wish, but no longer as a type (i.e. specification), but as something
real, a value of that type. This implementation at least does not return. Many have dreamed of such a useful device, and if it exists it could do wonders even if only in computing. The type &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha.\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is so general, that its values belong to the realm of imagination.&lt;/ref&gt; but never really returns:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{fix}\ \text{id} : \forall a . a&lt;/math&gt;.
In practical programming such a function can come in handy when breaking out of a computation,
like with &lt;code&gt;exit(1)&lt;/code&gt; in [[C (programming language)|C]], while silencing the type checker in
the current branch by returning essentially nothing but with a suitable type.

Less desirable is that the type checker (type inferencer) now succeeds with a type for a function that in fact never returns any value, like &lt;math&gt;\text{fix}\ \text{id}&lt;/math&gt;. The function ''would'' return a value of this type, but it ''cannot'' because no terminating function with this type exists. The type checker's claim that everything is ok thus has to be taken with a grain of salt. The types might only be ''claimed'' to be checked, but the program can still be typed wrong. Only if all functions are terminating does &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the logic above have a ''true'' value, and the assertions of the type checker become strong again.

=== Overloading ===

{{main|Type class}}

Overloading means, that different functions still can be defined and used with the same name. Most programming languages at least provide overloading with the built-in arithmetic operations (+,&lt;,etc.), to allow the programmer to write arithmetic expressions in the same form, even for different numerical types like &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;. Because a mixture of these different types within the same expression also demands for implicit conversion, overloading especially for these operations is often built into the programming language itself. In some languages, this feature is generalized and made available to the user, e.g. in C++.

While [[Ad hoc polymorphism|ad-hoc overloading]] has been avoided in functional programming for the computation costs both in type checking and inference{{Citation needed|reasoning=I remember Huet wrote an article on this topic|date=June 2018}}, a means to systematise overloading has been introduced that resembles both in form and naming to object oriented programming, but works one level upwards. "Instances" in this systematic are not objects (i.e. on value level), but rather types.
The quicksort example mentioned in the introduction uses the overloading in the orders, having the following type annotation in Haskell:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
quickSort :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
&lt;/source&gt;
Herein, the type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not only polymorphic, but also restricted to be an instance of some type class &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;, that provides the order predicates &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; used in the functions body. The proper implementations of these predicates are then passed to quicksorts as additional parameters, as soon as quicksort is used on more concrete types providing a single implementation of the overloaded function quickSort.

Because the "classes" only allow a single type as their argument, the resulting type system can still provide inference. Additionally, the type classes can then be equipped with some kind of overloading order allowing one to arrange the classes as a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]].

=== Meta types ===

{{main|Type_class#Higher-kinded_polymorphism}}

Parametric polymorphism implies that types themselves are passed as parameters as if they were proper values. Passed as arguments into a proper functions as in the introduction, but also into "type functions" as in the "parametric" type constants, leads to the question how to more properly type types themselves. A meta type,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
The term "higher-order" has been so overused, that "meta type" is preferred here.
&lt;/ref&gt; the "type of types" would be useful to create an even more expressive type system.

Though this would be a straight forward extension, unfortunately, only [[Unification (computer science)#Higher-order unification|unification]] is not longer decidable in the presence of meta types, rendering type inference impossible in this extend of generality.
Additionally, assuming a type of all types that includes itself as type leads into a paradox, as in the set of all sets, so one must proceed in steps of levels of abstraction.
Research in [[second order lambda calculus]], one step upwards, showed, that type inference is undecidable in this generality.

Parts of one extra level has been introduced into Haskell named [[Kind (type theory)|kind]], where it is used helping to type [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]]. Kinds are left implicit, working behind scene in the inner mechanics of the extended type system.

=== Subtyping ===

{{main|Subtyping}}

Attempts to combine subtyping and type inference have caused quite some frustration. While type inference is needed in object-oriented programming for the same reason as in functional languages, methods like HM cannot be made going for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is not difficult to setup a type system with subtyping enabling object-oriented style, as
e.g. [[Cardelli]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
  | first = Luca
  | last = Cardelli |author2=Martini, Simone |author3=Mitchell, John C. |author4=Scedrov, Andre
  | title = An extension of  system F with subtyping
  | booktitle = Information and Computation, vol. 9
  | pages = 4–56
  | year = 1994
  | location = North Holland, Amsterdam
  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540184710133

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; shows in [[System F-sub|his system]] &lt;math&gt;F_{&lt;:}&lt;/math&gt;.

* The type equivalence can be broken up into a subtyping relation "&lt;:".
* Extra type rules define this relation e.g. for the [[Subtyping#Function types|functions]].
* A suiting [[Subtyping#Record types|record type]] is then added whose values represent the objects.

Such objects would be immutual in a functional language context, but the type system would enable object-oriented programming style and the type inference method could be reused in imperative languages.

The subtyping rule for the record types is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\displaystyle\frac{
n \le m\quad\quad \tau_1 &lt;: \tau_1' \quad \dots \quad \tau_n &lt;: \tau_n'
}{
\Gamma\ \vdash\ \mathbf{Record}\ v_1 : \tau_1\ \dots\  v_n : \tau_n\ \mathbf{end} &lt;: \mathbf{Record}\ v_1 : \tau_1'\ \dots\  v_m : \tau_m'\ \mathbf{end}
}\quad[\mathtt{Record}]
&lt;/math&gt;
Syntatically, record expressions would have form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{record}\ v_1 = e_1,\ \dots\ \mathbf{end}&lt;/math&gt;
and have a type rule leading to the above type.
Such record values could then be used the same way as objects in object oriented programming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1246">An '''immutable characteristic''' is any sort of physical attribute which is perceived as being unchangeable, entrenched and innate. The term is often used to describe segments of the population which share such attributes and are contrasted from others by those attributes, and is used in [[human rights law]] to classify [[protected class|protected group]]s of people who should be protected from civil or criminal actions which are directed against those immutable characteristics.

For example, a legal debate about [[sexual orientation]] concerns whether it is a mutable or immutable characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0AMN4_xZJDsC|title = The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation|last = Stein|first = Edward|date = 2001-04-12|publisher = OUP USA|isbn = 9780195142440|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If it is immutable, then homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality, heterosexuality, etc., are all immutable characteristics that naturally occur and cannot be changed.  If it is mutable, then those characteristics ''can'' be changed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">The '''''Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations''''' (Russian: «Закон О свободе совести и о религиозных объединениях»), also known as the 1997 Law  (Russian: «Закон 1997 года») is a [[Russia]]n law passed and signed by President [[Boris Yeltsin]] on September 26, 1997.&lt;ref name="Law of Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association"&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/freedomofconscienceeng.html], the translation of the law from Stretson University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law redefined the state's relationship with religion, as Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had defined in on the Law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on Freedom of Worship passed on October 25, 1990, commonly known as the 1990 Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/cedir/cedir/Lex-doc/Ru_l_1990.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[fall of Communism]], Gorbachev had given much-needed breathing room to the practice of religion in Russia, whose culture's heart is Eastern Orthodoxy, but had also opened the door indescriminately and generally to the practice of religion. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] believed that a new law was needed to preserve Russia against what they considered to be the corruption of Orthodoxy.

The law was formulated and pushed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], secular nationalists, and communists alike, with such determination that though Yeltsin vetoed the bill once, he could not legitimately do so a second time.

Written in the law was the upholding of separation of church and state, as well as an interdiction against a state religion.  With that in mind, the following definitions and regulations are given:

==Definitions==
* ''religious organizations:'' at the level of individual church congregations
* ''religious associations:'' whole denominations
* ''religious groups:'' groups without legal status, such as a bible study group

==Regulations==
* Organizations may only be founded by Russian citizens
: ''this ostensibly provided for national security.''

* All associations must have a religious purpose, including:
** a [[creed]],
** regular worship services,
** the conducting of religious education.
: ''aimed at [[Evangelicalism#Evangelical para-church organizations|para-church]] organizations such as [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] and the [[Salvation Army]].''

* No organization may function until they have been registered with the government for 15 years, unless it affiliates with an existing association.  During the wait, the following is forbidden:
** public worship services,
** distribution of literature and materials,
** the hiring of foreign clergy.
: ''this discouraged independent-style and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches such as [[Baptists]].''

* A religious group may be liquidated by the government for any of the following reasons:
** creating an armed [[militia]] unit,
** threatening the integrity of the [[Russian Federation]],
** infringing on the health of its citizens,
** restricting its members from leaving the religion,
** encouraging its members to disobey civic duties.

==Effects==
Religion under the new law became nearly as regulated as it had been in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, though without the official communist hostility.  It did accomplish some expulsion of [[Western culture|Western]] religious work, though it left room for some foreign churches to legitimately register.  There had been on the order of 16,000 registered organizations before the passage of the law, and by 2004 there were 22,000.  By regulating on grounds common among new, foreign organizations, it made it difficult for them to take root, and it succeeded in promoting and securing a privileged place for the Russian Orthodox Church.

On June 22, 2005, debate of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) concluded, that the 1997 Law "creates a complex form of categorization of religions which has led to various forms of discrimination and to the stigmatization of 'non-traditional' religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dimarzio.info/it/docum/finish/7-acm-europe/251-a-case-study-fecris.html|title=A Case Study: FECRIS|last=Besier|first=Gerhard|last2=Seiwert|first2=Hubert|publisher=Lit verlag|year=2012|isbn=978-3-643-99894-1|location=Berlin|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lotka–Volterra equations''', also known as the '''predator–prey equations''', are a pair of first-order [[nonlinear]] [[differential equation]]s, frequently used to describe the [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of [[Systems biology|biological systems]] in which two species interact, one as a [[predator]] and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= \alpha x - \beta x y, \\
 \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= \delta x y - \gamma y,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:{{mvar|x}} is the number of prey (for example, [[rabbit]]s);
:{{mvar|y}} is the number of some [[Predation|predator]] (for example, [[fox]]es);
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; represent the instantaneous growth rates of the two populations;
:{{mvar|t}} represents time;
:{{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} are positive real [[parameter]]s describing the interaction of the two [[species]].

The Lotka–Volterra system of equations is an example of a [[Kolmogorov]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=H. I. |title=Deterministic Mathematical Models in Population Ecology |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brauer |first=F. |last2=Castillo-Chavez |first2=C. |title=Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoppensteadt |first=F. |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Predator-prey_model |title=Predator-prey model |work=[[Scholarpedia]] |volume=1 |issue=10 |page=1563 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a more general framework that can model the dynamics of ecological systems with predator–prey interactions, [[Competition_(biology)|competition]], disease, and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].

==History==
The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey [[mathematical model|model]] was initially proposed by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] in the theory of autocatalytic chemical reactions in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Periodic Reaction|journal=[[Journal of Physical Chemistry A|J. Phys.

S.|display-authors=etal|title=On the Volterra and Other Non-Linear Models of Interacting Populations|location=|publisher=Academic Press|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was effectively the [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic equation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman|first=A.

H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&amp;id=8GsEAAAAYAAJ&amp;jtp=113#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Notice sur la loi que la population poursuit dans son accroissement|journal=Corresp. mathématique et physique|volume=10|issue=|pages=113–121|year=1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 Lotka extended the model, via [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], to "organic systems" using a plant species and a herbivorous animal species as an example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|pmc=1084562|title=Analytical Note on Certain Rhythmic Relations in Organic Systems|journal=[[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.]]|volume=6|issue=|pages=410–415|year=1920|doi=10.1073/pnas.6.7.410|pmid=16576509}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 he utilised the equations to analyse predator–prey interactions in his book on [[biomathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|title=Elements of Physical Biology|location=|publisher=[[Williams and Wilkins]]|year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same set of equations was published in 1926 by [[Vito Volterra]], a mathematician and physicist, who had become interested in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref name="Goelmany"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volterra|first=V.|title=Variazioni e fluttuazioni del numero d’individui in specie animali conviventi|journal=[[Accademia dei Lincei|Mem. Acad. Lincei Roma]]|volume=2|issue=|pages=31–113|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Volterra|first=V.|chapter=Variations and fluctuations of the number of individuals in animal species living together|title=Animal Ecology|editor-last=Chapman|editor-first=R. N.|location=|publisher=[[McGraw–Hill]]|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volterra's enquiry was inspired through his interactions with the marine biologist [[Umberto D'Ancona]], who was courting his daughter at the time and later was to become his son-in-law. D'Ancona studied the fish catches in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and had noticed that the percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of [[World War I]] (1914–18). This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years. Volterra developed his model independently from Lotka and used it to explain d'Ancona's observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kingsland|first=S.|title=Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology|location=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0-226-43728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was later extended to include density-dependent prey growth and a [[functional response]] of the form developed by [[C. S. Holling]]; a model that has become known as the Rosenzweig–McArthur model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=M. L.|last2=MacArthur|first2=R.H.|year=1963|title=Graphical representation and stability conditions of predator-prey interactions|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=209–223|doi=10.1086/282272|volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Lotka–Volterra and Rosenzweig–MacArthur models have been used to explain the dynamics of natural populations of predators and prey, such as the [[lynx]] and [[snowshoe hare]] data of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilpin|first=M. E.|year=1973|title=Do hares eat lynx?|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=727–730|doi=10.1086/282870|volume=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the moose and wolf populations in [[Isle Royale National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=C.|last2=Devulder|first2=G.|last3=Vucetich|first3=J.A.|last4=Peterson|first4=R.|last5=Arditi|first5=R.|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00977.x|title=The wolves of Isle Royale display scale-invariant satiation and density dependent predation on moose|journal=J. Anim. Ecol.|volume=74|issue=5|pages=809–816|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, an alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model (and its common-prey-dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations|Arditi–Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arditi|first=R.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L. R.|year=1989|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf|title=Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=139|issue=|pages=311–326|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(89)80211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of prey- or ratio-dependent models has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abrams|first=P. A.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L. R.|year=2000|title=The nature of predation: prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=15|issue=8|pages=337–341|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)01908-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lotka–Volterra equations have a long history of use in [[Economics|economic theory]]; their initial application is commonly credited to [[Richard M. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gandolfo|first=G.|authorlink=Giancarlo Gandolfo|title=Giuseppe Palomba and the Lotka–Volterra equations|journal=Rendiconti Lincei|volume=19|issue=4|pages=347–357|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12210-008-0023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=R. M.|chapter=A Growth Cycle|title=Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth|editor-last=Feinstein|editor-first=C. H.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=M.|last2=Ormerod|first2=P.|url=http://www.paulormerod.com/pdf/economicjournal1998.pdf|title=Richard Goodwin: A Short Appreciation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|volume=108|issue=450|pages=1431–1435|year=1998|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical meaning of the equations==
The Lotka–Volterra model makes a number of assumptions, not necessarily realizable in nature, about the environment and evolution of the predator and prey populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/predator-prey.html|title=PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS|website=www.tiem.utk.edu|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The prey population finds ample food at all times.
#The food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population.
#The rate of change of population is proportional to its size.
#During the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species, and genetic adaptation is inconsequential.
#Predators have limitless appetite.

As differential equations are used, the solution is [[determinism|deterministic]] and [[Continuous function|continuous]]. This, in turn, implies that the generations of both the predator and prey are continually overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=D.|last2=Hiorns|first2=R. W.|display-authors=etal|title=The Mathematical Theory of the Dynamics of Biological Populations|volume=II|publisher=Academic Press|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations}}

===Prey===
When multiplied out, the prey equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta x y.&lt;/math&gt;

The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this [[exponential growth]] is represented in the equation above by the term ''αx''. The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet, this is represented above by ''βxy''. If either {{mvar|x}} or {{mvar|y}} is zero, then there can be no predation.

With these two terms the equation above can be interpreted as follows: the rate of change of the prey's population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is preyed upon.

===Predators===
The predator equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta xy - \gamma y.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''δxy'' represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). ''γy'' represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration, it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey.

Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator's population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate.

==Solutions to the equations==
The equations have [[periodic function|periodic]] solutions and do not have a simple expression in terms of the usual [[trigonometric function]]s, although they are quite tractable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Antonio|last2=Gander|first2=Martin Jakob|year=1999|title=Parametrische Lösungen der Räuber-Beute-Gleichungen im Vergleich|journal=Il Volterriano|volume=7|issue=|pages=32–44|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:6300/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=C. M.|last2=Findley|first2=G. L.|title=A new transformation for the Lotka-Volterra problem|journal=Journal of Mathematical Chemistry|volume=25|issue=|pages=105–110|year=1999|doi=10.1023/A:1019172114300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If none of the non-negative parameters {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} vanishes, three can be absorbed into the normalization of variables to leave only one parameter: since the first equation is homogeneous in {{math|''x''}}, and the second one in {{math|''y''}}, the parameters ''β''/''α'' and ''δ''/''γ'' are absorbable in the normalizations of {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, and {{math|''γ''}} into the normalization of {{math|''t''}}, so that only {{math|''α''/''γ''}} remains arbitrary. It is the only parameter affecting the nature of the solutions.

A [[linearization]] of the equations yields a solution similar to [[simple harmonic motion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tong|first=H.|title=Threshold Models in Non-linear Time Series Analysis|location=|publisher=Springer–Verlag|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the population of predators trailing that of prey by 90° in the cycle.

===A simple example===
Suppose there are two species of animals, a baboon (prey) and a cheetah (predator). If the initial conditions are 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs, one can plot the progression of the two species over time. The choice of time interval is arbitrary.
[[File:Cheetah Baboon LV.jpg|center]]

One may also plot solutions parametrically as [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s in [[phase space]], without representing time, but with one axis representing the number of prey and the other axis representing the number of predators for all times.

This corresponds to eliminating time from the two differential equations above to produce a single differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{y}{x} \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{\beta y -\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
relating the variables ''x'' and ''y''. The solutions of this equation are closed curves. It is amenable to [[separation of variables]]: integrating
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta y - \alpha}{y} \,dy + \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{x} \,dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
yields the implicit relationship 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \delta x - \gamma \ln(x) + \beta y - \alpha \ln(y),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is a constant quantity depending on the initial conditions and conserved on each curve.

[[File:CentralTendencyLV.jpg|center|Phase-space plot]]

An aside: These graphs illustrate a serious potential problem with this ''as a biological model'': For this specific choice of parameters, in each cycle, the baboon population is reduced to extremely low numbers, yet recovers (while the cheetah population remains sizeable at the lowest baboon density). In real-life situations, however, chance fluctuations of the discrete numbers of individuals, as well as the family structure and life-cycle of baboons, might cause the baboons to actually go extinct, and, by consequence, the cheetahs as well. This modelling problem has been called the "atto-fox problem", an [[atto-]]&lt;nowiki&gt;fox&lt;/nowiki&gt; being a notional 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; of a fox.&lt;ref name="LobrySari2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobry |first1=Claude |last2=Sari |first2=Tewfik |title=Migrations in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and the "atto-fox" problem |journal=Arima |date=2015 |volume=20 |pages=95-125 |url=http://arima.inria.fr/020/pdf/vol.20.pp.95-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mollison |first=D. |url=http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~denis/epi/velocities.pdf |title=Dependence of epidemic and population velocities on basic parameters |journal=Math. Biosci. |volume=107 |pages=255–287 |year=1991 |doi=10.1016/0025-5564(91)90009-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase-space plot of a further example===
A less extreme example covers: 
{{mvar|α}} = 2/3, {{mvar|β}} = 4/3, {{mvar|γ}} = 1 = {{mvar|δ}}. Assume {{math|''x'', ''y''}} quantify thousands each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}} = 0.9 to 1.8, in steps of 0.1. The fixed point is at (1, 1/2).
[[Image:Lotka-Volterra orbits 01.svg|center]]

==Dynamics of the system==
In the model system, the predators thrive when there are plentiful prey but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator population is low, the prey population will increase again. These dynamics continue in a cycle of growth and decline.

===Population equilibrium===
Population equilibrium occurs in the model when neither of the population levels is changing, i.e. when both of the derivatives are equal to 0:
:&lt;math&gt;x(\alpha - \beta y) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-y(\gamma - \delta x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above system of equations yields two solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\{y = 0, x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{y = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}, x = \frac{\gamma}{\delta} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, there are two equilibria.

The first solution effectively represents the extinction of both species. If both populations are at 0, then they will continue to be so indefinitely. The second solution represents a fixed point at which both populations sustain their current, non-zero numbers, and, in the simplified model, do so indefinitely. The levels of population at which this equilibrium is achieved depend on the chosen values of the parameters ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', and ''δ''.

===Stability of the fixed points===
The stability of the fixed point at the origin can be determined by performing a [[linearization]] using [[partial derivative]]s.

The [[Jacobian matrix]] of the predator–prey model is

:&lt;math&gt;J(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 
 \alpha - \beta y &amp; -\beta x \\
 \delta y &amp; \delta x - \gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
and is known as [[community matrix]].

====First fixed point (extinction)====
When evaluated at the steady state of (0,&amp;nbsp;0), the Jacobian matrix ''J'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt;J(0, 0) = \begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -\gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvalue]]s of this matrix are

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \alpha, \quad \lambda_2 = -\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

In the model ''α'' and ''γ'' are always greater than zero, and as such the sign of the eigenvalues above will always differ. Hence the fixed point at the origin is a [[saddle point]].

The stability of this fixed point is of significance. If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels. However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model.) The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover.

====Second fixed point (oscillations)====
Evaluating ''J'' at the second fixed point leads to
:&lt;math&gt;J\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right) = \begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; -\frac{\beta \gamma}{\delta} \\
 \frac{\alpha \delta}{\beta} &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of this matrix are
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}, \quad \lambda_2 = -i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As the eigenvalues are both purely imaginary and conjugate to each others, this fixed point is [[Dynamical system#Conjugation results|elliptic]], so the solutions are periodic, oscillating on a small ellipse around the fixed point, with a period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

As illustrated in the circulating oscillations in the figure above, the level curves are closed [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s surrounding the fixed point: the levels of the predator and prey populations cycle and oscillate without [[damping]] around the fixed point with period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the [[constant of motion]] ''V'', or, equivalently, ''K'' = exp(''V''), &lt;math&gt;K = y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found for the closed orbits near the fixed point.

Increasing ''K'' moves a closed orbit  closer to the fixed point. The largest value of the constant ''K'' is obtained by solving the optimization problem
:&lt;math&gt;y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x} = \frac{y^\alpha x^\gamma}{e^{\delta x+\beta y}} \longrightarrow \max\limits_{x,y&gt;0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The maximal value of ''K'' is thus attained at the stationary (fixed) point &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and amounts to 
:&lt;math&gt;K^* = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta e}\right)^\alpha \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta e}\right)^\gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''e'' is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]].

==The Model==
[[File:Magpie illustration.jpg|thumb|Input data and output parameters of MAgPIE]]
The model is based on static yield functions in order to model potential crop productivity and its related water use.&lt;ref name=Lotze-Campen2008 /&gt; For the biophysical supply simulation, spatially explicit 0.5° data is aggregated to a consistent number of clusters. Ten world regions represent the demand side of the model. Required calories for the demand categories (food and non-food energy intake) are determined by a cross-sectional country regression based on population and income projections. In order to fulfill the demand, the model allocates 19 cropping and 5 [[livestock]] activities to the spatially-explicit land and water resources, subject to resource, management and cost constraints. From 1995 MAgPIE simulates time-steps of 10 years. For each period the optimal land use pattern from the previous period is used as a starting point.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt; 

==Demand==
The demand for agricultural products is fixed for every region and every time-step. The drivers of agricultural demand are: time, income and population growth. Total demand is composed of: food demand, material demand, feed demand and seed demand. Food demand depends on food energy demand, and the share of crop and livestock products in the diet. Within livestock products, the share of different products (Ruminant meat, chicken meat, other meat, milk, eggs) is fixed at 1995 levels. The same is valid for the share of crops within total food calories and material demand. The share of livestock products in the total consumed food calories is an important driver for the land-use sector. Different statistical models are used to estimate plausible future scenarios. A calibration is used to reach the livestock shares of the Food Balance Sheets for 1995 for each region.

Feed for livestock is produced as a mixture of concentrates, fodder, livestock products (e.g. bone meal), pasture, crop residues and conversion by-products (e.g. rapeseed cake) at predefined proportions. These differences in the livestock systems cause different emission levels from livestock.

==Biophysical Inputs==
The biophysical inputs for the simulations are obtained from the grid-based model [[LPJmL]]. The global vegetation model with managed land (LPJmL) also delivers values for water availability and requirements for each grid cell as well as the carbon content of the different vegetation types. Cropland, pasture, and irrigation water are fixed inputs in limited supply in each grid cell.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt;

==Cost Types==
MAgPIE takes four different cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components on a global scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). 

MAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC).&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt; Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in agricultural land-use intensity raises costs for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land.

To increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land.&lt;ref name=Krause2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=M.|author2=Lotze-Campen, H. |author3=Popp, A. |title=Spatially-explicit scenarios on global cropland expansion and available forest land in an integrated modelling framework|journal=Conference Paper|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit as a function of the distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt;

'''Manasikara''' (Sanskrit and Pali, also ''manasikāra''; Tibetan Wylie: ''yid la byed pa'' or ''yid byed'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term that is translated as "attention" or "ego-centric demanding". It is defined as the process of the mind fixating upon an object.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 406-410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Manasikara'' is identified within the Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] teachings as follows:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Seven_universal_mental_factors|''seven universal mental factors'']] in the Theravada Abhidharma.
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Five_universal_mental_factors|''five universal mental factors'']] in the Mahayana Abhidharma

==Definitions==
===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2225-2232}}
: The Pali word literally means “making in the mind.” Attention is the mental factor responsible for the mind’s advertence to the object, by virtue of which the object is made present to consciousness. Its characteristic is the conducting (sāraṇa) of the associated mental states towards the object. Its function is to yoke the associated states to the object. It is manifested as confrontation with an object, and its proximate cause is the object. Attention is like the rudder of a ship, which directs it to its destination, or like a charioteer who sends the well-trained horses (i.e. the associated states) towards their destination (the object). Manasikāra should be distinguished from [[vitakka]]: while the former turns its concomitants towards the object, the latter applies them onto the object. Manasikāra is an indispensable cognitive factor present in all states of consciousness; vitakka is a specialized factor which is not indispensable to cognition. 

The [[Atthasālinī]] (I, Part IV, Chapter 1, 133) and the [[Visuddhimagga]] (XIV, 152) define manasikāra as follows:

:...It has the characteristic of driving associated states towards the object, the function of joining (yoking) associated states to the object, the manifestation of facing the object. It is included in the saṅkhārakkhandha, and should be regarded as the charioteer of associated states because it regulates the object.&lt;ref&gt;Gorkom (2010), [https://archive.is/20130505135429/http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Vitality-and-Attention.html Definition of jīvitindriya]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana===
The [[Asanga|Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is manasikara? It is a continuity having the function of holding the mind to what has become its reference.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

[[Herbert Guenther]] states:
: It is a cognition that keeps the complex of mind in its specific objective reference.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

The difference between ''[[cetanā]]'' and ''manasikara'' is that ''cetanā'' brings the mind towards the object in a general move, while ''manasikara'' makes the mind fixate upon this particular objective reference.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">As defined by the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]] the '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful''ness'' of the marginal use thus corresponds to the [[marginal utility]] of the good or service.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that an agent is [[Rational choice theory|economically rational]], each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein" /&gt;  And, in the absence of a complementarity across uses, [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|the “law” of diminishing marginal utility]] will obtain.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; “Utility”, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

The Austrian School of economics explicitly arrives at its conception of marginal utility as the utility of the marginal use, and “Grenznutzen” (the Austrian School term from which “marginal utility” was originally derived in translation&lt;ref&gt;Streissler, E., “Wieser, Friedrich, Freiherr von”, [[The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4  (1987), p. 921.&lt;/ref&gt;) literally means ''border-use''; other schools usually do not make an explicit connection.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

According to the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bradd Shore]], the '''''neuromantic'''''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Culture in Mind: Cognition, Culture, and the Problem of Meaning|url=|volume=|pages=141, 143–4|year=1996|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=|isbn=|id=|authorlink=Bradd Shore|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the cybernetic frame of mind among excited computer enthusiasts as they experience what Michael Heim called "the all-at-once simultaneity of totalizing presentness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Shore explains that "the sense of mastery over language resources that word processing bestows on the experienced user is intimately related to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell|enframing ''(Bestellen'')]], a subjection of the world to human will that Heidegger saw as a characteristic of all modern technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are sources that claim the concept of neuromantic is not only confined to computer enthusiasts. For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the "third nature," which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the "unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teletechnologies, Place, and Community|last=Wilken|first=Rowan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415875950|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Flow (psychology)|Flowstates]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="89717">'''Neuroscience of free will''', a part of [[neurophilosophy]], is the study of the interconnections between [[free will]] and [[neuroscience]].

As it has become possible to study the human living [[brain]], researchers have begun to watch [[decision making]] processes at work. Findings could carry implications for our [[sense of agency]], [[moral responsibility]], and our understanding of [[consciousness]] in general.&lt;ref name="Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Institute of Art and Ideas|title=Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience|url=http://iai.tv/video/fate-freedom-and-neuroscience|publisher=IAI|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; One of the pioneering studies in this domain was designed by [[Benjamin Libet]],&lt;ref name="Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libet|first=Benjamin|title=Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=1985|volume=8|pages=529–566|url=http://selfpace.uconn.edu/class/ccs/Libet1985UcsCerebralInitiative.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2013|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00044903}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies have attempted to predict participant actions before they make them.&lt;ref name=soonetal /&gt; [[File:Some brain areas.png|thumb|right|350px|Some areas of the human brain implicated in mental disorders that might be related to free will.

The field remains highly controversial. There is no consensus among researchers about the significance of findings, their meaning, or what conclusions may be drawn. The precise role of consciousness in decision making therefore remains unclear.

Thinkers like [[Daniel Dennett]] or [[Alfred Mele]] consider the language used by researchers. They explain that "free will" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will are [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]], some not). Dennett insists that many important and common conceptions of "free will" are compatible with the emerging evidence from neuroscience.&lt;ref name=WalterH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = ...the current work is in broad agreement with a general trend in neuroscience of volition: although we may experience that our conscious decisions and thoughts cause our actions, these experiences are in fact based on readouts of brain activity in a network of brain areas that control voluntary action...It is clearly wrong to think of [feeling of willing something] as a prior intention, located at the very earliest moment of decision in an extended action chain. Rather, W seems to mark an intention-in-action, quite closely linked to action execution.|source = -Patrick Haggard&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; discussing an in-depth experiment by Itzhak Fried&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt;}}
One significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, other scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice.&lt;ref name=soonetal&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2112 |title=Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain |year=2008 |last1=Soon |first1=Chun Siong |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Heinze |first3=Hans-Jochen |last4=Haynes |first4=John-Dylan |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=543–5 |pmid=18408715}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some forms of "free will". To be clear, no single study would disprove all forms of free will. This is because the term "[[free will]]" can encapsulate different hypotheses, each of which must be considered in light of existing [[empirical evidence]].

There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0076-2 |title=Free will debates: Simple experiments are not so simple |year=2010 |last1=Klemm |first1=W. R. |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=47–65 |pmid=20859552 |pmc=2942748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that ''have'' been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt; Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of "free will" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

===Free will as illusion===
[[File:Playing the piano.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously.]]It is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.

It may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious 'intentions' have led us astray; it may be the case that we have [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]] by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in [[neurostimulation]], [[brain damage]], but also research into [[introspection illusion]]s. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for [[moral responsibility]]. Neuroscientist and author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is 'intuitive': he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues - "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;"The Moral Landscape", p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientist [[Walter Jackson Freeman III]] nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.

===Disputed relevance of scientific research===
Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that "We feel we choose, but we don't".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Researcher [[John-Dylan Haynes]] adds "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Philosophers Walter Glannon and [[Alfred Mele]] think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because "[[free will]]" can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] notions of free will – but that is an "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in [[materialistic]] terms. In these cases, "free will" means something more like "not coerced" or that "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=left|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote= "[Some senses of free will] are compatible with what we are learning from science...If only that was what scientists were telling people. But scientists, especially in the last few years, have been on a rampage – writing ill-considered public pronouncements about free will which... verge on social irresponsibility.

This issue may be controversial for good reason: There is evidence to suggest that people normally associate a [[Free will#Believing in free will|belief in free will]] with their ability to affect their lives.&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9047-7 |title=Why 'Willusionism' Leads to 'Bad Results': Comments on Baumeister, Crescioni, and Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Nahmias |first1=Eddy |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 |title=Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Holton |first1=Richard |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=13–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], author of ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'' and a supporter of [[compatibilism|deterministic free will]], believes scientists risk making a serious mistake. He says that there are types of free will that are incompatible with modern science, but he says those kinds of free will are not worth wanting. Other types of "free will" are pivotal to people's sense of responsibility and purpose (see also [[Free will#Believing in free will|"believing in free will"]]), and many of these types are actually compatible with modern science.&lt;ref name=DennettPOI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_the_scientific_study_of_religion/|title=Daniel Dennett - The Scientific Study of Religion|publisher=Point of Inquiry |type=Podcast|date=December 12, 2011}}. Discussion of free will starts especially at 24 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other studies described below have only just begun to shed light on the role that consciousness plays in actions and it is too early to draw very strong conclusions about certain kinds of "free will". It is worth noting that such experiments – so far – have dealt only with free will decisions made in short time frames (seconds) and ''may'' not have direct bearing on free will decisions made ("thoughtfully") by the subject over the course of ''many'' seconds, minutes, hours or longer. Scientists have also only so far studied extremely simple behaviors (e.g. moving a finger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/the-moral-sciences-club/what-can-neuroscience-teach-us-about-evil|title=What can neuroscience teach us about evil?|author=Will Wilkinson}} {{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adina Roskies points out five areas of neuroscientific research:  1.) action initiation, 2.) intention, 3). decision, 4.) Inhibition and control, and 5.) the phenomenology of agency, and for each of these areas Roskies concludes that the science may be developing our understanding of volition or "will", but it yet offers nothing  for developing the "free" part of the "free will" discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adina L.

They asked their subjects to read one of two passages: one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control; the other neutral about what influences behaviour. The participants then did a few math problems on a computer. But just before the test started, they were informed that because of a glitch in the computer it occasionally displayed the answer by accident; if this happened, they were to click it away without looking. Those who had read the deterministic message were more likely to cheat on the test. "Perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse to behave as one likes," Vohs and Schooler suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110831/full/477023a.html|title=Neuroscience vs philosophy: Taking aim at free will|first=Kerri|last=Smith|date=31 August 2011|volume=477|issue=7362|pages=23–25|doi=10.1038/477023a|pmid=21886139|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18181791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x | volume=19 | title=The value of believing in free will: encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating | date=January 2008 | journal=Psychol Sci | pages=49–54 | last1 = Vohs | first1 = KD | last2 = Schooler | first2 = JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable experiments==

===Libet experiment===
A pioneering experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain (in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP), which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;). Although it was well known that the Bereitschaftspotential (sometimes also termed "readiness potential") preceded the physical action, Libet asked how the Bereitschaftspotential corresponded to the felt intention to move. To determine when the subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock and report its position when they felt that they had felt the conscious will to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;

[[File:B.Libet.experiment.gif|thumb|left|300px|Libet's experiment: (0) repose, until (1) the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] is detected, (2-Libet's W) the volunteer memorizes a dot position upon feeling their intention, and (3) then acts.]]
Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity leading up to the ''conscious'' decision by the subject to flick their wrist began approximately half a second ''before'' the subject consciously felt that they had decided to move.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0355-1_16 |chapter=Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action |title=Neurophysiology of Consciousness |series=Contemporary Neuroscientists |year=1993 |last1=Libet |first1=Benjamin |isbn=978-1-4612-6722-5 |pages=269–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libet's findings suggest that decisions made by a subject are first being made on a subconscious level and only afterward being translated into a "conscious decision", and that the subject's belief that it occurred at the behest of their will was only due to their retrospective perspective on the event.

The interpretation of these findings has been criticized by [[Daniel Dennett]], who argues that people will have to shift their attention from their intention to the clock, and that this introduces temporal mismatches between the felt experience of will and the perceived position of the clock hand.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.

Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that "the awareness of the intention to move" is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their '[[Bereitschaftspotential]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/ideas/19231 Bigthink.com]{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
[[File:Bereitschaftspotenzial fig1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Typical recording of the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] that was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;). [[Benjamin Libet]] investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the "felt intention" (or will) to move of experimental subjects.]]

In a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide ''which hand to move''. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the "[[lateralized readiness potential]]" (LRP), an [[Event-related potential|ERP]] component which measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.&lt;ref name="HandE" /&gt;

A more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the "awareness of the intention to move" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's "W").  If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information.  However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02254.x |title=We Infer Rather Than Perceive the Moment We Decided to Act |year=2009 |last1=Banks |first1=William P. |last2=Isham |first2=Eve A. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |pages=17–21 |pmid=19152537 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, regardless of whether or not volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a decision has been made.&lt;ref name=Anil&gt;{{cite journal

In a second experiment, researchers asked volunteers to decide on the spot whether to use left hand or right to tap the key while monitoring their brain signals, and they found no correlation among the signals and the chosen hand. This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a "stimulus-response" circuit and a "voluntary" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt;

Libet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious "will" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their "will". Authors have found that [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA]] activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement.&lt;ref name="Lau2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=H. C.|title=Attention to Intention|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5661|year=2004|pages=1208–1210|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1090973}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the perceived onset of intention depends on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) applied over the [[supplementary motor area|preSMA]] after a participant performed an action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and the perceived time of action execution forward in time.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Hakwan C.|last2=Rogers|first2=Robert D.|last3=Passingham|first3=Richard E.|title=Manipulating the Experienced Onset of Intention after Action Execution|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=1|year=2007|pages=81–90|issn=0898-929X|doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.81|pmid=17214565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have speculated that the preceding neural activity reported by Libet may be an artefact of averaging the time of "will", wherein neural activity does not always precede reported "will".&lt;ref name="Trevena" /&gt; In a similar replication they also reported no difference in electrophysiological signs before a decision not to move, and before a decision to move.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

Despite his findings, Libet himself did not interpret his experiment as evidence of the inefficacy of conscious free will — he points out that although the tendency to press a button may be building up for 500 milliseconds, the conscious will retains a right to veto any action at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Libet |first=Benjamin |year=2003 |title=Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity? |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=24–8 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=24&amp;epage=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, unconscious impulses to perform a volitional act are open to suppression by the conscious efforts of the subject (sometimes referred to as "free won't"). A comparison is made with a [[golf]]er, who may swing a club several times before striking the ball. The action simply gets a rubber stamp of approval at the last millisecond. [[Max Velmans]] argues however that "free won't" may turn out to need as much neural preparation as "free will" (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velmans |first1=Max |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=42&amp;epage=61 |title=Preconscious Free Will |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=42–61 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have however replicated Libet's findings, whilst addressing some of the original criticisms.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; A recent study has found that individual neurons were found to fire 2 seconds before a reported "will" to act (long before EEG activity predicted such a response).&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Itzhak Fried replicated Libet's findings in 2011 at the scale of the single neuron. This was accomplished with the help of volunteer [[epilepsy]] patients, who needed [[electrodes]] implanted deep in their brain for evaluation and treatment anyway. Now able to monitor awake and moving patients, the researchers replicated the timing anomalies that were discovered by Libet and are discussed in the following study.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Similarly to these tests, [[Chun Siong Soon]], [[Anna Hanxi He]], [[Stefan Bode]] and [[John-Dylan Haynes]] have conducted a study in 2013 claiming to be able to predict the choice to sum or subtract before the subject reports it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/6217|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|first1=Chun Siong|last1=Soon|first2=Anna Hanxi|last2=He|first3=Stefan|last3=Bode|first4=John-Dylan|last4=Haynes|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=15|pages=6217–6222|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William R.

===Unconscious actions===

====Timing intentions compared to actions====
A study by Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, published in 2008, claims to have replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization on the part of participants.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the [[readiness potential]]). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.

=====The experiment=====
[[File:Wijsvinger.jpg|thumb|right|120px|It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain.]]
Matsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.

To test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled "stop-signal" sound was played at pseudo random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there ''was'' an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his "movement genesis" (or else they would have stopped or "vetoed" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.

In this work, "movement genesis" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see [[Benjamin Libet]]).

By looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness (as seen in the graph below) is dubbed "T" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their [[Event-related potential]] (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.

The researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred ''too late'' to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at –2.8 seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time "T" (−1.8 seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

=====Analysis and interpretation=====
[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A simple "signalling noise" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of.]]
This study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed "stop tones" during the self paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call "T"(time)

Testing the hypothesis that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action – they have passed the action's "point of no return". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).

[[File:TimingConsciousIntentiontoMoveHistogram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe the subject becomes aware of his actions at about -1.769 seconds (this is time 'T'). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as −2.8 seconds.]]
The graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (dubbed "tone events" on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about −1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (−1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to [[Event-related potential|ERP]] measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about −2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T — like Libet's original W — was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Haggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing "a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations"&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements, and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of [[planning]] has implications for free will and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our "conscious self" has become aware of it does not mean our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.&lt;ref name=mele&gt;{{cite book

===Unconsciously cancelling actions===
The possibility that human "free won't" is also the prerogative of the subconscious is being explored.

====Retrospective judgement of free choice====
[[File:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|left|140px|As green light switches to yellow, research seems to suggest that humans cannot tell the difference between "deciding" to keep driving, and having no time to decide at all.]]

Recent research by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may not be what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it ''easy'' to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the [[introspection illusion]]. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to "veto" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====The experiment=====
The experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic "go" button as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the "primary response trials".

The primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal – either a "stop" or "decide" signal. The additional signals occurred after a "signal delay" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2 seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal – and was therefore considered the "default" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the "go" button) remained.

Upon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the "go" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the "go" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the "go" button, or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal ("decide trials"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too ''late'' in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).

Those trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

The participant was asked at the end of those "decide trials" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.

=====The rationale=====

Kuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed-to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants’ successful decide trials into "decide go" and "decide nogo", but were not concerned with the nogo trials since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either.
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionTrials.png|thumb|right|400px|The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes.]]

Kuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the "failed-to-decide" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively – they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the "successful ''decide''" trials (where the decision was a "go" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject ''does'' act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====Results and implications=====
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionGraph.png|thumb|left|300px|The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled "successful decide".]]
Unsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and "failed-to-decide" trials all showed similar RTs: 600&amp;nbsp;ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some "successful decide" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400&amp;nbsp;ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as "successful decide". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious "I will not veto", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain:

{{cquote|[The results of the experiment] clearly argue against Libet's assumption that a veto process can be consciously initiated. He used the veto in order to reintroduce the possibility to control the unconsciously initiated actions. But since the subjects are not very accurate in observing when they have [acted impulsively instead of deliberately], the act of vetoing cannot be consciously initiated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;}}

In decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide – at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of "consciousness" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously).

=====Criticisms=====
After the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between "producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600&amp;nbsp;ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study).

The results of the trial in which the so-called "successful decide" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response — and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

It is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"/&gt; That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by Kühn and Brass using their decide signal.

Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds &amp;mdash; a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D.

=== The point of no return ===
In early 2016, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] published a paper by researchers in [[Berlin]], Germany, ''The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements'', in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/1080|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2016-01-26|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4743787|pmid = 26668390|pages = 1080–1085|volume = 113|issue = 4|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1513569112|first = Matthias|last = Schultze-Kraft|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Birman|first3 = Marco|last3 = Rusconi|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Allefeld|first5 = Kai|last5 = Görgen|first6 = Sven|last6 = Dähne|first7 = Benjamin|last7 = Blankertz|first8 = John-Dylan|last8 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is an instance of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neural oscillation|electrical activity]] within the [[motor cortex]], quantified by the use of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is "getting ready" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neuroscience and Free Will Are Rethinking Their Divorce|url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html|website = Science of Us|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously, it had been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brain might not stand in the way of free will|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22144-brain-might-not-stand-in-the-way-of-free-will/|website = New Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-13|first = Anil|last = Ananthaswamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21870/free_will_web.pdf|title = Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism|date = |access-date = |website = Oxford University|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Swinburne|first = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Libet Experiments|url = http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html|website = www.informationphilosopher.com|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that subjects were able to "override" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a "point of no return": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it 200 [[millisecond]]s or longer before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, USA, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuronal prediction of free will ===
Despite criticisms, experimenters are still trying to gather data that may support the case that conscious "will" can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so.&lt;ref name="soonetal" /&gt; Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex ([[anterior]] [[Lateral and medial|medial]] [[prefrontal cortex]]) and [[precuneus]]/[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[cingulate cortex]] (medial [[parietal cortex]]). In order to ensure report timing of conscious "will" to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.

Another version of the fMRI multivariate pattern analysis experiment was conducted using an abstract decision problem, in an attempt to rule out the possibility of the prediction capabilities being product of capturing a built-up motor urge.&lt;ref name="SoonHe2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soon|first1=C. S.|last2=He|first2=A. H.|last3=Bode|first3=S.|last4=Haynes|first4=J.-D.|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=15|year=2013|pages=6217–6222|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each frame contained a central letter like before, but also a central number, and a surrounding 4 possible "answers numbers". The participant first chose in their mind whether they wished to perform an addition or difference (subtraction) operation (and noted the central letter on the screen at the time of this decision). The participant then performed the mathematical operation based on the central numbers shown in the next two frames. In the following frame the participant then chose the "answer number" corresponding to the result of the operation. They were further presented with a frame which allowed them to indicate the central letter appearing on the screen at the time of their original decision. This version of the experiment discovered a brain prediction capacity of up to 5 seconds before the conscious will to act.

Multivariate pattern analysis using EEG has suggested that an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions.&lt;ref name="BodeSewell2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=S.|last2=Sewell|first2=D.

Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine the nature of the stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes.&lt;ref name="MattlerPalmer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattler|first1=Uwe|last2=Palmer|first2=Simon|title=Time course of free-choice priming effects explained by a simple accumulator model|journal=Cognition|volume=123|issue=3|year=2012|pages=347–360|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.002|pmid=22475294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data).&lt;ref name="LagesJaworska2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lages|first1=Martin|last2=Jaworska|first2=Katarzyna|title=How Predictable are "Spontaneous Decisions" and "Hidden Intentions"?

Multivariate pattern analysis using fMRI could be trained on "free decision" data to successfully predict "guess decisions", and trained on "guess data" in order to predict "free decisions" (in the [[cuneus|precuneus and cuneus]] region).

Contemporary voluntary decision prediction tasks have been criticised based on the possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower conscious processing rather than unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="MillerSchwarz2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Jeff|last2=Schwarz|first2=Wolf|title=Brain signals do not demonstrate unconscious decision making: An interpretation based on graded conscious awareness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=24|year=2014|pages=12–21|issn=1053-8100|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2013.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may be aware of their decisions before making their report yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. Such a model does not however explain what is left unconscious if everything can be conscious at some level (and the purpose of defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements.

===Retrospective construction===

It has been suggested that sense authorship is an illusion.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00002-0 |title=The mind's best trick: How we experience conscious will |year=2003 |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=65–69 |pmid=12584024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconscious causes of thought and action might facilitate thought and action, while the agent experiences the thoughts and actions as being dependent on conscious will. We may over-assign agency because of the evolutionary advantage that once came with always suspecting there might be an agent doing something (e.g. predator). The idea behind retrospective construction is that, while part of the "yes, I did it" feeling of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] seems to occur during action, there also seems to be processing performed after the fact – after the action is performed – to establish the full feeling of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2004_2/Rakos_2004.pdf | title=The Belief in Free Will as a Biological Adaptation: Thinking Inside and Outside the Behavior Analytic Box | author=Richard F.

Unconscious agency processing can even alter, in the moment, how we perceive the timing of sensations or actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2497 |title=Human volition: Towards a neuroscience of will |year=2008 |last1=Haggard |first1=Patrick |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=934–46 |pmid=19020512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"/&gt; Kühn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in "successful decide" RT's. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials that should have been labelled "failed to decide" were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They say that people "persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes" when in fact we do a great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs.

It should be noted that criticism to Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. criticism by H. Andersen in his paper with the title 'Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will' ; Also as a criticism, read "On the alleged illusion of conscious will' by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem. Other papers can be found).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulating choice===

[[File:Transcranial magnetic stimulation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] uses magnetism to safely stimulate or inhibit parts of the brain.]]
Some research suggests that [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] can be used to manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice.&lt;ref name="Walsh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Walsh|title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Neurochronometrics of Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rACRPwAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Mit Press|isbn=978-0-262-73174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task.&lt;ref name="ammon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.8.705 |title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation can influence the selection of motor programmes |year=1990 |last1=Ammon |first1=K |last2=Gandevia |first2=S C |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=705–7 |pmid=2213050 |pmc=488179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammon and Gandevia found that it was possible to influence which hand people move by stimulating [[frontal lobe|frontal]] regions that are involved in movement planning using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.

Right-handed people would normally choose to move their right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, [[Alvaro Pascual-Leone]] and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.&lt;ref name="Brasil-NetoPascual-Leone1992"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.55.10.964 |title=Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation and response bias in a forced-choice task |year=1992 |last1=Brasil-Neto |first1=J P |last2=Pascual-Leone |first2=A |last3=Valls-Sole |first3=J |last4=Cohen |first4=L G |last5=Hallett |first5=M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=964–6 |pmid=1431962 |pmc=1015201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, a team of researchers from the UK and the US published a paper demonstrating similar findings. The researchers concluded that "motor responses and the choice of hand can be modulated using [[Transcranial direct-current stimulation|tDCS]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/JOCN_A_00848|title=Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Motor Cortex Biases Action Choice in a Perceptual Decision Task |year=2015 |last1=Javadi |first1=Amir-Homayoun |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=2174–85 |pmid=26151605 |last2=Beyko |first2=Angeliki |last3=Walsh |first3=Vincent |pmc=4745131}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a different attempt by Sohn ''et al.'' failed to replicate such results;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.7.985 |title=The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on movement selection |year=2003 |last1=Sohn |first1=Y H |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=985–7 |pmid=12810802 |last2=Kaelin-Lang |first2=A |last3=Hallett |first3=M |pmc=1738563}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey Gray]] wrote in his book ''Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem'' that tests looking for the influence of electromagnetic fields on brain function have been universally negative in their result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Jeffrey Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-852090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulating the perceived intention to move===

Various studies indicate that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies have focused on the pre-[[supplementary motor area]] (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"/&gt; In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating [[premotor cortex|premotor]] brain regions.&lt;ref name="DesmurgetReilly2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desmurget|first1=M.|last2=Reilly|first2=K. T.|last3=Richard|first3=N.|last4=Szathmari|first4=A.|last5=Mottolese|first5=C.|last6=Sirigu|first6=A.|title=Movement Intention After Parietal Cortex Stimulation in Humans|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5928|year=2009|pages=811–813|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1169896|pmid=19423830}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.

This suggests that awareness of an intention to move may literally be the "sensation" of the body's early movement, but certainly not the cause. Other studies have at least suggested that "The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2007 |title=High-frequency oscillations in distributed neural networks reveal the dynamics of human decision making |year=2008 |last1=Guggisberg |first1=Adrian G. |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=1 |pmid=18958227 |last2=Dalal |first2=SS |last3=Findlay |first3=AM |last4=Nagarajan |first4=SS |pages=14 |pmc=2525986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment involved an electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe they were entirely self-conducted.&lt;ref name="WegnerWheatley1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wegner|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Wheatley|first2=Thalia|title=Apparent mental causation: Sources of the experience of will.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=7|year=1999|pages=480–492|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480|pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones they were more likely to say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).

Lau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16&amp;nbsp;ms, and shifted back the 14&amp;nbsp;ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200&amp;nbsp;ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007" /&gt; Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.

===Related models===

The idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of "forward models of motor control" (or FMMC, which have been used to try to explain [[inner speech]]). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see [[self serving bias]]es) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.009 |title=Metacognition of agency across the lifespan |year=2010 |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Janet |last2=Eich |first2=Teal S. |last3=Castel |first3=Alan D. |journal=Cognition |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=267–82 |pmid=20570251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says "these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur".&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of [[Libertarian free will|contra-causal free will]] even if it were determined.

How the brain constructs [[consciousness]] is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the [[Multiple Drafts Model]] which argues that there is no central [[Cartesian theater]] where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous 'filmstrip' comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of [[Cartesian materialism]] that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as [[epiphenomenalism]] argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also: [[Philosophy of mind]].)

=== Related brain disorders ===
Various brain disorders implicate the role of unconscious brain processes in decision making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by Schizophrenia seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003" /&gt; The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed.&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazzaniga|first1=Michael S.|title=The Cognitive Neurosciences|year=1984|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, people with 'alien hand syndrome' are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.&lt;ref name="GeschwindIacoboni1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geschwind|first1=D.

=== Neural models of voluntary action ===
A neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt; The first involving early preparatory signals ([[basal ganglia]] [[substantia nigra]] and [[striatum]]), prior intention and deliberation (medial [[prefrontal cortex]]), motor preparation/readiness potential ([[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]]), and motor execution ([[primary motor cortex]], [[spinal cord]] and [[muscle]]s). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping ([[premotor cortex]], [[primary motor cortex]], [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal cortex]], and back to the [[premotor cortex]]). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input ('when decision'), motivations/reasons for actions (early 'whether decision'), task and action selection ('what decision'), a final predictive check (late 'whether decision') and action execution.

Another neural model for voluntary action also involves what, when, and whether (WWW) based decisions.&lt;ref name="BrassLynn2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brass|first1=Marcel|last2=Lynn|first2=Margaret T.|last3=Demanet|first3=Jelle|last4=Rigoni|first4=Davide|title=Imaging volition: what the brain can tell us about the will|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=229|issue=3|year=2013|pages=301–312|issn=0014-4819|doi=10.1007/s00221-013-3472-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prospection ===
{{Main article|Prospection}}
[[Martin Seligman]] and others criticize the classical approach in science which views animals and humans as "driven by the past", and suggest instead that people and animals draw on experience to evaluate prospects they face, and act accordingly. The claim is made that this purposive action includes evaluation of possibilities that have never occurred before, and is experimentally verifiable.&lt;ref name=Seligman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

Seligman and others argue that free will and the role of subjectivity in consciousness can be better understood by taking such a "prospective" stance on cognition, and that "accumulating evidence in a wide range of research suggests [this] shift in framework".&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">The '''North–South model''', developed largely by [[Columbia University]] economics professor [[Ronald Findlay]], is a model in [[Development economics|developmental economics]] that explains the growth of a less developed "[[Global South|South]]" or "periphery" economy that interacts through trade with a more developed "[[Global North|North]]" or "core" economy. The North–South model is used by dependencia theorists as a theoretical economic justification for [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdenur, Adriana [http://www.tc.columbia.edu/cice/Issues/04.02/42abdenur.pdf "Tilting the North South Axis"], ''Princeton University'', 2002, accessed June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
The model makes a few critical assumptions about the North and the South, as well as the relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Molana, H. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2234035 "North South Growth and the Terms of Trade"], ''The Economic Journal'', 1989, accessed June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Northern economy is operating under [[Exogenous growth model|Solow-Swan assumptions]] while the Southern economy is operating under [[Dual sector model|Lewis growth assumptions]]. However, for the purposes of simplicity of this model, the output of the traditional sector of the Lewis model is ignored, and we equate output in the modern sector of the South to total output of the South.
* The more developed North produces [[final goods|manufactured goods]] while the less developed South produces [[primary sector of the economy|primary goods]]. These are the only two goods.
* Both economies undergo complete [[division of labor|specialization]]
* There are no barriers to trade, and only two trading partners
* [[Income elasticity of demand]] equals unity in both countries, so economic growth results in a proportionate growth in demand.
* The South depends on the imported goods from the North in order to produce its own goods. This is because the heavy machinery required for production of primary products comes only from the North. The relationship is nonreciprocal, however; the North does not depend on the South, since it can use its own heavy machinery to produce manufactured goods.

==Theory==
The North–South model begins by defining the relevant equations for the economies of each country, and concludes that the growth rate of the South is locked by the growth rate of the North.&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, Ronald. ''Growth and Development in Trade Model''.Handbook of International Economics, 1984, p. 185-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion relies heavily on an analysis of the [[terms of trade]] between the two countries; i.e., the price ratio between manufactures and primary products. The terms of trade, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, are defined as

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{price\,of\,primary\,products}{price\,of\,manufactures} &lt;/math&gt;

To determine equilibrium, we need only to look at the market for one of the goods, as per [[Walras' law]]. We consider the market for the South's goods: primary products. The demand for imports, M, from the South is a positive function of per capita consumption in the North and a negative function of the terms of trade, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, (higher &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; means relative price of primary products is high and less will be demanded). The supply side comes from export of primary products by the South, X, and is a positive function of the terms of trade and the South’s aggregate consumption of primary products.

[[File:Terms of Trade in North-South Model.png|Screen shot 2000-06-24 at 11.23.41 AM]]

This graph makes it clear that the real terms of trade decreases when the growth rate is higher in the South than in the North (because, thanks to unity in elasticity of demand, the export line would shift to the right faster than the import line). The resultant decrease in the terms of trade, however, means a lower growth rate for the South. This creates a [[negative feedback]] cycle in which the growth rate of the South is exogenously determined by that of the North. Note that the growth rate of the north, g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, is equal to n + m, where n is population growth and m is growth of [[technological change|labor-augmenting technical progress]], as per the [[Exogenous growth model|Solow-Swan model]].

[[File:Growth in the North South Model.png|Growth in the North South Model]]

The conclusion, which fits in with dependency theory, is that the South can never grow faster than the North, and thus will never catch up.

==Relationship to import substitution theories==

Economic theories such as the North–South model have been used to justify arguments for [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]]. Under this theory, less developed countries should use barriers to trade such as [[protective tariff]]s to shelter their industries from foreign competition and allow them to grow to the point where they will be able to compete globally.&lt;ref&gt;Whalley, John. ''The North South Debate and the Terms of Trade''. A Review of Economics and Statistics, 1984, Vol. 66 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note, however, that the North–South model only applies to countries that are completely specialized; that is, they are not competing with foreign markets – they are the only ones producing whichever good they are producing. The way around the terms of trade trap predicted by the North–South model is to produce goods that do compete with foreign goods. For example, the [[four asian tigers|Asian Tigers]] are famous for pursuing development strategies that involved using their [[comparative advantage]] in labor to produce [[labor intensity|labor-intensive]] goods like textiles more efficiently than the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Anne. ''Trade Policy as an Input to Development''. NBER Working Paper No. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32318">Relatively speaking, the [[brain]] consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body. The mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function.&lt;ref name="alpha" /&gt; Human bodily processes, including the brain, all require both [[Nutrient|macronutrients]], as well as [[micronutrients]].&lt;ref name= bravo&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17066209 |year=2006 |last1=Bourre |first1=JM |title=Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: Update on dietary requirements for brain.

==Nutrients needed for memory development==

===Choline===
[[Choline]] is an [[essential nutrient]] and its primary function within the human body is the synthesis of [[Cell membrane|cellular membranes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/choline Choline (at Linus Paulin Inst){{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it serves other functions as well.  It is a precursor molecule to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] which serves a wide range of functions including motor control and memory.  Choline itself has also been shown to have additional health benefits in relation to memory and choline deficiencies may be related to some liver and [[neurological disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x |title=Choline: An essential nutrient for public health |year=2009 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H |last2=Da Costa |first2=Kerry-Ann |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain. Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the [[Adequate Intake]] levels.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt; Women, especially pregnant or lactating women, older people, and infants, are especially at risk for choline deficiency.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt;

==B-Vitamin deficiencies and cognition==
[[B vitamins]], also known as the B-complex, are an interrelated group of nutrients which often co-occur in food. The complex consists of: [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|pyridoxin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[biotin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/27-40_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was " |page=27 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B vitamins are not [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] in the body, and thus need to be obtained from food. B-complex vitamins are water-soluble vitamins, which means that they are not stored within the body. In consequence, the B vitamins need ongoing replenishment.&lt;ref name= charlie/&gt; It is possible to identify broad cognitive effects of certain B vitamins, as they are involved in many significant [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="bravo" /&gt;

Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 "D's": diarrhea, [[dermatitis]], dementia, and death. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis.

Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's dementia]]. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (folic acid)===
Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; play a vital role in the synthesis of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]], which is of key importance in the maintenance and repair of all cells, including neurons.&lt;ref name= oscar&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1865312 |year=1991 |last1=Hauck |first1=MR |title=Cognitive abilities of preschool children: Implications for nurses working with young children |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=230–5 |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name= november&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/196-305_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was "|page=196 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of blood plasma folate and [[homocysteine]] concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration.

The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood,&lt;ref name="quebec"/&gt; as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6247.1036 |title=The neuropsychiatry of megaloblastic anaemia |year=1980 |last1=Shorvon |first1=S D |last2=Carney |first2=M W |last3=Chanarin |first3=I |last4=Reynolds |first4=E H |journal=BMJ |volume=281 |issue=6247 |pages=1036–8 |pmid=6253016 |pmc=1714413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt; In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard [[Antidepressant|antidepressant therapy]] than did those with normal levels within plasma.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; However, replication of these findings are less robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12042457 |year=2002 |last1=Bryan |first1=J |last2=Calvaresi |first2=E |last3=Hughes |first3=D |title=Short-term folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-6 supplementation slightly affects memory performance but not mood in women of various ages |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1345–56 |journal=The Journal of Nutrition|doi=10.1093/jn/132.6.1345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in [[learning]] and memory, particularly within the elderly population.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.11.3.487 |title=Effects of serum vitamin B-sub-1-sub-2 and folate status on episodic memory performance in very old age: A population-based study |year=1996 |last1=Wahlin |first1=Åke |last2=Hill |first2=Robert D. |last3=Winblad |first3=Bengt |last4=Bäckman |first4=Lars |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=487–96 |pmid=8893317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] speed were observed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60109-3 |title=Effect of 3-year folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in older adults in the FACIT trial: A randomised, double blind, controlled trial |year=2007 |last1=Durga |first1=Jane |last2=Van Boxtel |first2=Martin PJ |last3=Schouten |first3=Evert G |last4=Kok |first4=Frans J |last5=Jolles |first5=Jelle |last6=Katan |first6=Martijn B |last7=Verhoef |first7=Petra |journal=The Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=208–216 |pmid=17240287|url=https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/effect-of-3year-folic-acid-supplementation-on-cognitive-function-in-older-adults-in-the-facit-trial-a-randomised-double-blind-controlled-trial(35d288c0-c91e-417c-b2b7-a35a0fbc8361).html |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance. However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.&lt;ref name= "Fioravanti"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18653121 |year=1998 |last1=Fioravanti |first1=M |last2=Ferrario |first2=E |last3=Massaia |first3=M |last4=Cappa |first4=G |last5=Rivolta |first5=G |last6=Grossi |first6=E |last7=Buckley |first7=AE |title=Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |doi=10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy.&lt;ref name= papa&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11475447 |year=2001 |last1=Moyers |first1=S |last2=Bailey |first2=LB |title=Fetal malformations and folate metabolism: Review of recent evidence |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=215–24 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref name="oscar"/&gt;

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin)===
Also known as cobalamin, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health.&lt;ref name= sierra&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf }}{{page needed|was "|page=306 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, also known as [[hypocobalaminemia]], often results from complications involving absorption into the body.&lt;ref name= victor&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17043022 |year=2006 |last1=Hvas |first1=AM |last2=Nexo |first2=E |title=Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency--an update |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1506–12 |journal=Haematologica}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75–90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.

These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of [[myelin]],&lt;ref name= yankee&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5006.1394 |title=Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin-B12 Deficiency |year=1956 |last1=Holmes |first1=J.

Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of [[Mental confusion|confusion]], severe agitation and depression, [[delusions]] and paranoid behavior, visual and auditory [[hallucinations]], dysphasia, violent maniacal behavior and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency.&lt;ref name="yankee"/&gt;

Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show poor [[Attentional control|concentration]]. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss. It is not always easy to determine whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is present, especially within older adults.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Patients may present with violent behavior or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behavior in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well.

Patients deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6&amp;nbsp;µg/day of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000&amp;nbsp;µg of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; administered [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patients life. The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.&lt;ref name= zulu&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malouf|first1=R|title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD004514|authorlink2=John Grimley Evans|last2=Grimley Evans|first2=J|last3=Areosa Sastre|first3=A|last4=Malouf|first4=Reem|year=2003|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004514|pmid=14584018|chapter=Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843658|date = November 2018}}

==Vitamin A deficiency and impaired memory==
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential [[nutrient]] for mammals which takes form in either [[retinol]] or the [[provitamin]] [[beta-Carotene]]. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the [[central nervous system]] and vision.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3923/ajcn.2009.65.82 |title=Vitamin A: A Review |year=2009 |last1=Edem |first1=D.O. |journal=Asian Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and cognitive disease==
Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1159/000310330 |title=Phosphatidylserine Containing ω–3 Fatty Acids May Improve Memory Abilities in Non-Demented Elderly with Memory Complaints: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial |year=2010 |last1=Vakhapova |first1=Veronika |last2=Cohen |first2=Tzafra |last3=Richter |first3=Yael |last4=Herzog |first4=Yael |last5=Korczyn |first5=Amos D. |journal=Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=467–74 |pmid=20523044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), which is the most prevalent omega-3 fatty acid found in neurons, have been studied extensively for use in possible prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Some studies (cross-sectional) suggest that reduced intake or low brain levels of DHA are associated with earlier development of cognitive deficits or development of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Several clinical trials suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation does not have significant effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease—which in turn may suggest that the protective benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could depend on the scope of the disease and other confounding factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jicha|first=GA|author2=Markesbery, WR |title=Omega-3 fatty acids: potential role in the management of early Alzheimer's disease.|journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging|date=Apr 7, 2010|volume=5|pages=45–61|pmid=20396634|pmc=2854051|doi=10.2147/cia.s5231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diet that is rich in antioxidants will also help get rid of free radicals in the body, which could be a cause for Alzheimer's. The buildup of Beta Amyloid plaques, a marker highly associated with Alzheimer's disease, generates cell damaging free radicals. Therefore, the role of antioxidants as protectants against Alzheimer's disease has become a hot topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Miranda S, Opazo C, Larrondo LF, Muñoz FJ, Ruiz F, Leighton F, Inestrosa NC  | year =2000| title =The role of oxidative stress in the toxicity induced by amyloid ß-peptide in Alzheimer's disease| journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume =62|issue =6|pages =633–648 | doi =10.1016/S0301-0082(00)00015-0|pmid =  10880853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple dietary modification, towards fewer highly processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats ad cholesterol, is likely a protective measure against Alzheimer's disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Additionally, [[folic acid]] has also been found to improve the memory of older people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3132">'''Oneironautics''' [ə.neɪ.roʊ.nɔː.tɪks] refers to the ability to travel within a [[dream]] on a [[lucid dreaming|conscious basis]]. Such a traveler in a dream may be called an '''oneironaut'''.

==Within one's dream==
{{main|Lucid dreaming}}
A lucid dream is one in which the dreamer is aware of dreaming and may be able to exert some degree of control over the dream's characters, narrative or environment. Early references to the phenomenon are found in ancient Greek texts.

==Within the dream of another==
{{main|Dream telepathy}}
The idea of one person being able to consciously travel or interact within the dream of another person, known variously as "'''dream telepathy'''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://alquinte.com/en/importance/lucid_mutual.shtml The Importance of Dreams Survey - Lucidity And Telepathy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucidity.com/LD9DIR.html Chapter 9 - Stephen LaBerge, (1985). LUCID DREAMING.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dream Telepathy by Montague Ullman, MD and Stanley Krippner, PhD with Alan Vaughan, {{ISBN|1-57174-321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreaminglucid.com/articles/Dream%20Telepathy%20Explain%20Mutual%20Dreaming%2053.pdf Does Dream Telepathy Explain Mutual Lucid Dreaming?]&lt;/ref&gt; "'''telepathic lucid dreaming'''" or "'''telepathic dreaming'''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychics.co.uk/telepathy.html Telepathy Dreams]&lt;/ref&gt; has been explored in the realms of science and fantasy fiction; in recent works, such an interaction is often depicted as a computer-mediated [[psychotherapeutic]] action, as is the case in ''[[The Cell]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'', as well as through the direct intervention of another sleeping person, as in ''[[Inception]]'', ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'' and ''[[Waking Life]]''. The concept is also included in the fantasy series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' as an ability "[[Unusual abilities (Wheel of Time)#Dreamers and Dreamwalking|dreamwalkers]]" are able to use.

A trope in such works of fiction explores the ramifications of whether the sleeping protagonist should enter the sleeping brain of another as opposed to allowing another individual to enter one's own brain; the entering of another individual's brain often results in unpleasant surprises, depending upon the mental state of the host or the preparedness of the guest. [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1966 sci-fi novella ''[[The Dream Master]]'', which applies computer-mediated dream telepathy in a psychotherapeutic setting, focuses on the protagonist's growing struggle to keep his balance as he enters the brain of a fellow psychotherapist who is blind and subconsciously, destructively hungers for the visual stimuli upon which dreams largely depend.

"'''Orwellian'''" is an adjective describing a situation, idea, or societal condition that [[George Orwell]] identified as being destructive to the welfare of a free and [[open society]]. It denotes an attitude and a brutal policy of draconian control by [[propaganda]], [[surveillance]], [[misinformation]], [[Denialism|denial of truth]] ([[doublethink]]), and manipulation of the past, including the "[[unperson]]"—a person whose past existence is expunged from the public record and memory, practised by modern repressive governments.

The '''ovulatory shift hypothesis''' is the [[theory]] that women experience [[evolution]]arily [[Adaptation|adaptive]] changes in subconscious thoughts and behaviors related to [[mating]] across the [[Menstrual cycle|ovulatory cycle]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gangestad |first=Steven W. |last2=Thornhill |first2=Randy |date=1998 |title=Menstrual cycle variation in women's preferences for the scent of symmetrical men |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1399/927 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=265 |issue=1399 |pages=927–933 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0380 |pmid=9633114|pmc=1689051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It proposes that [[Hormone|hormonal]] changes across the cycle cause women, when they are most likely to get [[Pregnancy|pregnant]], to be more attracted to traits in potential short-term male [[sexual partner]]s that indicate high [[gene]]tic quality, leading to greater [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; Some of these proposed traits are physical features like [[Fluctuating asymmetry|symmetry]]&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and [[masculinity]],&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while others are personality traits like [[Dominance and submission|dominance]]&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and [[creativity]],&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; and others are genetic traits like compatible [[major histocompatibility complex]] gene profiles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The theory also proposes that women's behavior may change during the most [[Fertility|fertile]] time in their ovulatory cycle. At high fertility, women may experience increased [[sexual desire]],&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; consume fewer calories,&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; become more physically active,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; avoid risky situations,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; avoid male relatives,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; dress more provocatively,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Durante |first=Kristina M. |last2=Li |first2=Norman P. |last3=Haselton |first3=Martie G. |date=2008 |title=Changes in women's choice of dress across the ovulatory cycle: Naturalistic and laboratory task-based evidence |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167208323103 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=1451–1460 |doi=10.1177/0146167208323103}}&lt;/ref&gt; become more competitive with other women,&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; flirt with men more frequently,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and experience decreased satisfaction with their current romantic partner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The theory is based on the principles of [[evolutionary psychology]] and has been extensively researched by scientists in the fields of [[psychology]], [[biological anthropology]], and [[evolutionary biology]].

Related research has shown that both men and other women may be able to subconsciously detect when a woman is in the most fertile phase of her ovulatory cycle. Women in the fertile phase are often rated as being more [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]], [[Body odour and sexual attraction|smelling more attractive]], and having [[Vocal register|higher-pitched voices]].&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haselton |first=Martie G. |last2=Gildersleeve |first2=Kelly |date=2011 |title=Can men detect ovulation? |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721411402668 |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=87–92 |doi=10.1177/0963721411402668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men in relationships tend to become more [[Jealousy|jealous]] of other men and protective of their partner when she is at high fertility.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Additionally, [[lap dance]]rs report receiving more tips during the fertile phase of their cycle.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As ovulatory shifts are predicted to be caused by changes in [[Sex steroid|sex hormones]] across the menstrual cycle, they may be affected by the use of [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]]. Studies often report that women who use hormonal birth control experience weaker or nonexistent ovulatory shifts in thoughts and behavior.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;

While many studies have demonstrated strong evidence in support of the ovulatory shift hypothesis, some studies have also failed to show significant effects for some predictions of the theory. Two [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] published in 2014 reached opposing conclusions on whether or not the existing evidence was robust enough to support the prediction that women's mate preferences change across the cycle.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Additionally, some researchers have suggested that the ovulatory shift hypothesis model that proposes changes in thoughts and behavior ''within'' each ovulatory cycle is incorrect, and that changes actually occur ''between'' cycles.&lt;ref name="Roney 14–19" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Estrus in humans ===
[[File:Baboon Butt (18601474779).jpg|thumb|Female baboons and many other primates experience sexual swellings that advertise their fertility during estrus. Humans do not display any such obvious physical signals of fertility, but may still experience a subtle estrus-like state.]]

Most female [[mammal]]s experience reproductive [[fertility]] cycles. They typically consist of a long period of low fertility, and a brief period of high fertility just prior to and including [[ovulation]]. In humans, this is called the ovulatory cycle, or [[menstrual cycle]]. The period of high fertility is also called the fertile window, and is the only time during the cycle when [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] can result in [[Pregnancy|conception]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925498570 |title=Intro to behavioral endocrinology |last=Randy |first=Nelson |date=2015 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=1605353825 |oclc=925498570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females of most mammalian species display hormonally-induced physical and behavioral signals of their fertility during the fertile window, such as [[sexual swelling]]s and increased motivation to mate.&lt;ref name="F. 2012"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778123209 |title=Primate sexuality: Comparative studies of the prosimians, monkeys, apes, and humans |last=Dixson |first=Alan F. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=0199676615 |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |pages= |oclc=778123209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species will not—or cannot—engage in sex at all outside of this window.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This phase of sexual receptivity and proceptivity, [[Estrous cycle|estrus]], is often referred to as being "in heat".

Human females, however, engage in sex throughout their ovulatory cycles, and even beyond their reproductive years. Additionally, they do not show obvious physical signals of high fertility. This has led many researchers to conclude that humans lost their estrus through evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/245881483 |title=Social behavior and organization among vertebrates |last=Etkin |first=William |publisher=University of Chicago Press |others= |year=1972 |isbn=0226220362 |edition=5 |location=Chicago |pages= |oclc=245881483}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized that this could be due to the adaptive benefits of [[concealed ovulation]] and [[Extended female sexuality|extended sexuality]].&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4135550 |title=Evolutionary biology and human social behavior : an anthropological perspective |date=1979 | publisher=Duxbury Press |others=Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-, Irons, William., American Anthropological Association |isbn=0878721932 |oclc=4135550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/265732721 |title=The evolutionary biology of human female sexuality |last=Randy. |first=Thornhill, |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |others=Gangestad, Steven W. |isbn=0195340981 |oclc=265732721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, research has shown that human females may in fact experience subtle but distinct physiological, behavioral, and cognitive changes during the high-fertility phase of their ovulatory cycle,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gangestad |first=Steven W. |last2=Thornhill |first2=Randy |date=2008 |title=Human oestrus |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1638/991 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=275 |issue=1638 |pages=991–1000 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1425 |pmid=18252670|pmc=2394562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gildersleeve |first=Kelly |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |last3=Fales |first3=Melissa R. |date=2014 |title=Do women’s mate preferences change across the ovulatory cycle?

=== Evolution of ovulatory cycle shifts ===
Estrus evolved to facilitate [[reproduction]] and maximize [[reproductive success]], or the success of passing on one's [[gene]]s by producing [[offspring]] that are most likely to survive and reproduce themselves.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that motivation and desire to mate should increase during the fertile window, and that females should seek and attract the best possible mate at their highest fertility.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; An ideal mate could have many qualities: resources to care for offspring, the physical ability and [[social status]] to protect a mate and offspring, a compatible personality for a long-term [[pair bond]], etc. [[Evolution |Evolutionary theory]] and [[Sexual selection |sexual selection theory]] suggest that an organism’s top priority should be to maximize survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952666572 |title=The selfish gene |date=1941 |author=Dawkins, Richard |isbn=0198788606 |edition=40th anniversary |location=Oxford |oclc=952666572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women possess a dual sexuality, where during the fertile window, a woman should prioritize attracting and choosing a mate with the best genetic quality, or “[[Good genes hypothesis|good genes]]”, since this is the only time she can become pregnant and pass on [[Heritability|heritable]] genetic qualities to her offspring. However, at low-fertility, a woman should prioritize a mate with "good parenting" traits, such as willingness and ability to invest in parenting, resources to devote to offspring, and compatibility for a long-term partnership.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905450212 |title=The handbook of evolutionary psychology |others=Buss, David M., |isbn=111875588X |edition=2nd |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |oclc=905450212}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differing traits are sometimes referred to as the "sexy cad" vs. the "good dad".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cantú |first=Stephanie M. |last2=Simpson |first2=Jeffry A. |last3=Griskevicius |first3=Vladas |last4=Weisberg |first4=Yanna J. |last5=Durante |first5=Kristina M. |last6=Beal |first6=Daniel J. |date=2013 |title=Fertile and selectively flirty |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613508413 |journal=Psychological Science |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=431–438 |doi=10.1177/0956797613508413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Durante |first=Kristina M. |last2=Griskevicius |first2=Vladas |last3=Simpson |first3=Jeffry A. |last4=Cantú |first4=Stephanie M. |last5=Li |first5=Norman P. |date=2012 |title=Ovulation leads women to perceive sexy cads as good dads |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0028498 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=292–305 |doi=10.1037/a0028498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been hypothesized that high-fertility preferences should be strongest when evaluating a short-term sexual partner, but low-fertility preferences should be strongest when evaluating a long-term relationship partner.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gangestad |first=Steven W. |last2=Garver-Apgar |first2=Christine E. |last3=Simpson |first3=Jeffry A. |last4=Cousins |first4=Alita J. |date=2007 |title=Changes in women's mate preferences across the ovulatory cycle |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.92.1.151 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=151–163 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.1.151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman can gain the benefits of good genes through only a single sexual encounter, and good dad traits are only relevant for a long-term pair bond.

Some researchers have suggested that over evolutionary time, women may have maximized reproductive success by seeking good genes from an [[extra-pair copulation]]—&lt;nowiki/&gt;cheating on their partner—at high fertility, while also maintaining a long-term pair bond with a partner who provides parenting resources for the offspring, sometimes called the dual strategy hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eastwick |first=Paul W. |date=2009 |title=Beyond the pleistocene: Using phylogeny and constraint to inform the evolutionary psychology of human mating |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0016845 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=5 |pages=794–821 |doi=10.1037/a0016845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; Of course, an optimal partner is one with both sexy cad and good dad traits, but such a man is statistically unlikely to be common. Thus, [[natural selection]] may have designed ancestral women to be opportunistic. If successful, a woman could gain the benefits of both high-quality genetics and high-quality parenting to give her offspring the best chance of survival. However, natural selection would not have favored men who desire to provide for offspring that do not share their genes, so this would have been a risky strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pillsworth |first=Elizabeth G. |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |date=2006 |title=Women's sexual strategies: The evolution of long-term bonds and extrapair sex |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10532528.2006.10559837 |journal=Annual Review of Sex Research |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=59–100 |doi=10.1080/10532528.2006.10559837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanisms ===

Ovulatory cycle shifts are hypothesized to be regulated by [[Sex steroid|sex hormones]], primarily [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]], which become elevated at different times across the cycle. In particular, high levels of estradiol and low levels of progesterone, which peak at high fertility just prior to ovulation, have been shown to be correlated with several mating-related psychological changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Puts |first=David A. |date=2010 |title=Beauty and the beast: Mechanisms of sexual selection in humans |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513810000279 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=157–175 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Garver-Apgar |first=Christine E. |last2=Gangestad |first2=Steven W. |last3=Thornhill |first3=Randy |date=2003 |title=Hormonal correlates of women's mid-cycle preference for the scent of symmetry |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.12.007 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=223–232 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some studies have only found correlations with changes in estradiol.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lukaszewski |first=Aaron W. |last2=Roney |first2=James R. |date=2009 |title=Estimated hormones predict women’s mate preferences for dominant personality traits |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0191886909000956 |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=191–196 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.02.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roney 14–19"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Roney |first=James R. |last2=Simmons |first2=Zachary L. |date=2008 |title=Women's estradiol predicts preference for facial cues of men's testosterone |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.09.008 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=14–19 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well-established that estradiol can act in the brain to produce other psychological and behavioral changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douma |first=S.

== Changes in cognition and behavior across the ovulatory cycle ==
Numerous studies have demonstrated ovulatory cycle shifts in women’s mating-related motivations, preferences, thoughts, and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that these shifts are designed by [[natural selection]] as [[evolutionary adaptation]]s for selecting and attracting specific types of mates with high genetic quality when a woman is most likely to get pregnant.

===Sexual desire===
Some of the earliest studies on human ovulatory shifts explored whether women engage in more instances of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] during high fertility, as this could indicate a human estrus-like state. While some studies have found increases in frequency of sexual activity at high fertility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilcox |first=A.

Researchers have subsequently explored whether [[sexual desire]], rather than frequency of sexual activity, changes across the ovulatory cycle, as this would not be affected by practical barriers to engaging in sex. Several studies in this area have shown that women’s sexual desire and [[masturbation]] behaviors do increase during the fertile window,&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Roney |first=James R. |last2=Simmons |first2=Zachary L. |date=2013 |title=Hormonal predictors of sexual motivation in natural menstrual cycles |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.02.013 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=636–645 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.02.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harvey |first=Marie S. |date=1987 |title=Female sexual behavior: Fluctuations during the menstrual cycle |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-3999(87)90104-8 |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1016/0022-3999(87)90104-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; although results have been mixed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haselton |first=Martie G. |last2=Gangestad |first2=Steven W. |date=2006 |title=Conditional expression of women's desires and men's mate guarding across the ovulatory cycle |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.10.006 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=509–518 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationship satisfaction ====
Consistent with the hypothesis that women may seek high quality genes from short-term extra-pair partners at high fertility, several studies have shown that fertile-phase women are more attracted to, [[Flirting|flirt]] more, and initiate sex more often, with men who are not their partner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In fact, women often report that attraction to their current partner does not increase during the fertile window, but both attraction and relationship satisfaction may actually decrease.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gangestad |first=Steven W. |last2=Thornhill |first2=Randy |last3=Garver |first3=Christine E. |date=2002 |title=Changes in women's sexual interests and their partner's mate–retention tactics across the menstrual cycle: Evidence for shifting conflicts of interest |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/269/1494/975 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=269 |issue=1494 |pages=975–982 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1952 |pmid=12028782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gangestad |first=Steven W. |last2=Thornhill |first2=Randy |last3=Garver-Apgar |first3=Christine E. |date=2005 |title=Women's sexual interests across the ovulatory cycle depend on primary partner developmental instability |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1576/2023 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=272 |issue=1576 |pages=2023–2027 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3112 |pmid=16191612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that this effect is particularly strong when women do not perceive their current partner to be highly [[Physical attractiveness|sexually attractive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Larson |first=Christina M. |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |last3=Gildersleeve |first3=Kelly A. |last4=Pillsworth |first4=Elizabeth G. |date=2013 |title=Changes in women's feelings about their romantic relationships across the ovulatory cycle |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.10.005 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=128–135 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pillsworth |first=Elizabeth G. |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |date=2006 |title=Male sexual attractiveness predicts differential ovulatory shifts in female extra-pair attraction and male mate retention |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.002 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=247–258 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Larson |first=Christina M. |last2=Pillsworth |first2=Elizabeth G. |last3=Haselton |first3=Martie G. |date=2012 |title=Ovulatory shifts in women’s attractions to primary partners and other men: Further evidence of the importance of primary partner sexual attractiveness |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044456 |journal=PLoS One |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=e44456 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0044456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eastwick |first=Paul W. |last2=Finkel |first2=Eli J. |date=2011 |title=The evolutionary armistice |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167211422366 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=174–184 |doi=10.1177/0146167211422366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in relationships also tend to be more [[Assertiveness|assertive]] and independent during the fertile phase.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gangestad |first=Steven W. |last2=Garver-Apgar |first2=Christine E. |last3=Cousins |first3=Alita J. |last4=Thornhill |first4=Randy |date=2014 |title=Intersexual conflict across women's ovulatory cycle |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.02.012 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=302–308 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, researchers have shown that women at ''low'' fertility tend to initiate sex with their primary partner more frequently, especially when they perceive their partner to be less invested in the relationship than they are, consistent with the idea that women seek investment in a long-term relationship when they are not likely to get pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grebe |first=Nicholas M. |last2=Gangestad |first2=Steven W. |last3=Garver-Apgar |first3=Christine E. |last4=Thornhill |first4=Randy |date=2013 |title=Women’s luteal-phase sexual proceptivity and the functions of extended sexuality |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613485965 |journal=Psychological Science |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=2106–2110 |doi=10.1177/0956797613485965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flirting ====
While women in relationships may experience decreased relationship satisfaction and increased flirting with [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair partners]] during high fertility, studies have shown that single women at high-fertility also engage in more flirting behavior, and are more receptive to men's advances.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Guéguen |first=Nicolas |date=2009 |title=Menstrual cycle phases and female receptivity to a courtship solicitation: An evaluation in a nightclub |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.03.004 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=351–355 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also flirt selectively with men described as "sexy cads" who display indicators of [[Sexy son hypothesis|good genes]], especially when considering them as short-term sexual partners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although women's attention to attractive men increases at high fertility, their memory for those men is not increased, consistent with the hypothesis that women would only be interested in them as short-term partners and would not need to remember them after ovulation has passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Uriah S. |last2=Perea |first2=Elaine F. |last3=Becker |first3=D.

===Attraction and mate preferences===
The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women at high fertility should be most [[Sexual attraction|attracted]] to short-term sexual partners with physical and behavioral features that likely signal genetic [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], or good genes.

====Symmetry====
[[File:Attracive-faces-symmetry.jpg|thumb|Female humans and other primates find faces with high levels of symmetry and masculinity more attractive, especially at high fertility.|252x252px]]

Charles Darwin first proposed that music, lacking a functional evolutionary explanation by natural selection, may be an instrument of [[sexual selection]], just like a male [[Peafowl|peacock]]'s extravagant feathers, which serve to attract a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |last=Darwin |first=Charles |publisher=John Murray |year=1871 |isbn= |location=London |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, humans may use artistic expressions as a display of good genetic qualities like [[creativity]] and [[intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43648482 |title=The mating mind : how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature |last=Miller |first=Geoffrey F. |publisher=Doubleday |year=2000 |isbn=0385495161 |edition=1st |location=New York |pages= |oclc=43648482}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, one study has found that women at high fertility preferred short-term partners described as creative artists over those described as wealthy businessmen, despite the fact that a wealthy man would have more resources to care for offspring.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haselton |first=Martie G. |last2=Miller |first2=Geoffrey F. |date=2006 |title=Women’s fertility across the cycle increases the short-term attractiveness of creative intelligence |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-006-1020-0 |journal=Human Nature |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=50–73 |doi=10.1007/s12110-006-1020-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compatible genes ====
The [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) is a suite of genes responsible for [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]] and [[histocompatibility]] in an organism's cells. In animals, including mammals and other primates, MHC has been shown to play a role in [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection|MHC sexual selection]], where organisms mate selectively with individuals who possess MHC alleles that are more dissimilar from their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yamazaki |first=K. |last2=Boyse |first2=E.

=== Clothing and grooming ===
The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women's behavior during the fertile phase should also reflect evolutionary adaptations for reproductive success, primarily through attempting to attract short-term mates of high-genetic quality. One avenue of this research has found that women tend to dress in clothing that is perceived to be more revealing, fashionable, or sexy at high fertility.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Fertile-phase women also spend more time on their appearance and tend to wear accessories like jewelry, makeup, or hairstyles that are perceived as trying to look more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haselton |first=Martie G. |last2=Mortezaie |first2=Mina |last3=Pillsworth |first3=Elizabeth G. |last4=Bleske-Rechek |first4=April |last5=Frederick |first5=David A. |date=2007 |title=Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.07.007 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=40–45 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Saad |first=Gad |last2=Stenstrom |first2=Eric |date=2012 |title=Calories, beauty, and ovulation: The effects of the menstrual cycle on food and appearance-related consumption |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1057740811001021 |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=102–113 |doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that women tend to purchase more products related to enhancing their appearance, attractive clothing, shoes, or accessories, during the fertile window.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Durante |first=Kristina M. |last2=Griskevicius |first2=Vladas |last3=Hill |first3=Sarah E. |last4=Perilloux |first4=Carin |last5=Li |first5=Norman P. |date=2011 |title=Ovulation, female competition, and product choice: Hormonal influences on consumer behavior |url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/6/921/1868588 |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=921–934 |doi=10.1086/656575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Risk-taking and inbreeding avoidance ===
Although a majority of research on the ovulatory shift hypothesis indicates that women consistently attempt to seek out and attract men during peak fertility, some studies have shown that high-fertility women strategically avoid two specific types of mating situations: [[rape]] and [[incest]]. Several studies have shown that women at peak fertility are more likely to avoid risky situations where [[sexual assault]] may be more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chavanne |first=Tara J. |last2=Gallup |first2=Gordon G. |date=1998 |title=Variation in risk taking behavior among female college students as a function of the menstrual cycle |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S1090-5138(98)00016-6 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=27–32 |doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(98)00016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bröder |first=Arndt |last2=Hohmann |first2=Natalia |date=2003 |title=Variations in risk taking behavior over the menstrual cycle: An improved replication |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513803000552 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=391–398 |doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(03)00055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have argued that natural selection should have designed women to be especially wary of rape during the fertile window, because women would not be able to selectively choose the genetic qualities they would prefer for their offspring, and that a man willing to engage in rape may actually possess some unfavorable genes. Women may also selectively avoid incest, another situation where deleterious genes could be passed on to her offspring. Studies have found that females of other species tend to avoid male kin during the fertile window,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ishida |first=Yasuko |last2=Yahara |first2=Tetsukazu |last3=Kasuya |first3=Eiiti |last4=Yamane |first4=Akihiro |date=2001 |title=Female control of paternity during copulation: Inbreeding avoidance in feral cats |jstor=4535818 |journal=Behaviour |volume=138 |issue=2 |pages=235–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Winn |first=Berry E. |last2=Vestal |first2=Bedford M. |date=1986 |title=Kin recognition and choice of males by wild female house mice (Mus musculus) |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0735-7036.100.1.72 |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=72–75 |doi=10.1037/0735-7036.100.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one study showed a similar result in humans: that women avoid speaking to their fathers when they are at peak fertility.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=Debra |last2=Pillsworth |first2=Elizabeth G. |last3=Haselton |first3=Martie G. |date=2010 |title=Kin affiliation across the ovulatory cycle |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797610390385 |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=13–18 |doi=10.1177/0956797610390385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitiveness with other women ===
[[Parental investment |Parental investment theory]] posits the idea that natural selection designed each sex to have different mating strategies based on how much investment the sex is required to devote to offspring for their survival.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62857839|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man|last=Trivers|first=Robert|publisher=Aldine Transaction|others=|year=1972|isbn=0202308456|editor-last=Campbell|editor-first=Bernard|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection|oclc=62857839}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex that invests more in offspring should be more [[Intersexual selection|intersexuality selective]], or picky when choosing a sexual partner, because they have more time and resources to lose if they make a poor choice. The other sex should be more [[Intrasexual competition|intrasexually competitive]], or competitive with members of their same sex, in order to access and attract the more selective sex.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In humans, as in all mammals, females are the sex that invests more in parenting, simply through the lengthy and taxing process of pregnancy and lactation, whereas males need only to contribute one act of sexual intercourse to pass on their genes. Thus, females are expected to be the more selective sex, and males are expected to be more competitive. However, unlike many species where males do not contribute to parenting at all, humans have highly dependent offspring, and a complex social structure that allows males to make significant and important investments in parenting effort. According to parental investment theory, this indicates that natural selection may have designed women to be somewhat competitive with other women for access to the best mates and potential fathers for their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rosvall |first=Kimberly A. |date=2011 |title=Intrasexual competition in females: Evidence for sexual selection? |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr106 |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=1131–1140 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arr106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have indicated that women engage in more competitive behaviors with other women when they are at high fertility. During the fertile window, women not using hormonal contraceptives self-report increased feelings of intrasexual competitiveness, describe other women as less attractive, and use more dehumanizing terms when talking about women, but not men.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fisher |first=M.

However, some researchers have noted that the reason why women should be more competitive during the fertile window is unclear.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women should be seeking short-term sexual partners at peak fertility, but men can effectively have multiple sexual partners, so competition over one high-quality man should not be necessary. If women were competing for a long-term partner, there is no reason why they should be more competitive during the fertile window than any other time in their cycle.

== Detecting ovulatory cycle shifts ==
In related research, there is evidence that both men and women can subconsciously detect cues to women's fertility that change across the ovulatory cycle.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; Some researchers have suggested that natural selection designed women to signal their fertility in order to attract a mate.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; However, other researchers have proposed that women evolved to have [[concealed ovulation]] but they still "leak" subtle cues of their fertility, and men have evolved to detect these cues.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Lap dancer tips ===
One of the first modern studies to explore whether women have truly concealed ovulation utilized a simple task: have professional [[lap dance]]rs record the amount of tips they receive for each day of their ovulatory cycle. The study found that women not using hormonal contraceptives earned significantly more money on the days they were most fertile, compared to other days in the cycle.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miller |first=Geoffrey |last2=Tybur |first2=Joshua M. |last3=Jordan |first3=Brent D. |date=2007 |title=Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers: Economic evidence for human estrus? |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.06.002 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=375–381 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers suggest that women may be more attractive to men during the fertile window, indicating that women do possess an estrus phase and that their ovulation is not completely concealed.

=== Body odor ===
During estrus, many species produce [[pheromone]]s, or body odors that indicate to potential mates that one is in the fertile phase. While no specific human pheromones have been identified, there is evidence that humans may exhibit similar scent changes at high fertility. Body odors of high-fertility women not using hormonal contraceptives are rated more attractive by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gildersleeve |first=Kelly A. |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |last3=Larson |first3=Christina M. |last4=Pillsworth |first4=Elizabeth G. |date=2012 |title=Body odor attractiveness as a cue of impending ovulation in women: Evidence from a study using hormone-confirmed ovulation |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0018506X11002704 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=157–166 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kuukasjarvi |first=S. |date=2004 |title=Attractiveness of women's body odors over the menstrual cycle: The role of oral contraceptives and receiver sex |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arh050 |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=579–584 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arh050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal odors from high-fertility women are also rated as more attractive than odors from the same women at low-fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doty |first=R.

=== Physical attractiveness ===
Researchers have found that both men and women rate physical features of women at high fertility more [[Physical attractiveness|attractive]] than when they are at low fertility. Facial attractiveness has been shown to increase in fertile phase women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Roberts |first=S.

=== Vocal pitch ===
Studies have found that fertile phase women speak with a slightly higher [[Vocal register|vocal pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryant |first=Gregory A. |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |date=2009 |title=Vocal cues of ovulation in human females |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/1/12 |journal=Biology Letters |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=12–15 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0507 |pmid=18845518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings of women's voices in the fertile phase are rated, by both men and women, as more attractive than recordings by the same women during low fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pipitone |first=R.

=== Partner jealousy ===
Several studies have found that men in a relationship tend to be more protective and possessive of their partner when she is at peak fertility, as well as more [[Jealousy|jealous]] of any advances their partner might make on other men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; One study also demonstrated that after interacting with their partner during the fertile phase, men shown a photograph of an attractive man exhibit increased testosterone, which may be a competitive response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fales |first=Melissa R. |last2=Gildersleeve |first2=Kelly A. |last3=Haselton |first3=Martie G. |date=2014 |title=Exposure to perceived male rivals raises men's testosterone on fertile relative to nonfertile days of their partner's ovulatory cycle |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2014.04.002 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=454–460 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of hormonal contraception ==
Since it has been proposed that changes in hormone levels across the ovulatory cycle are the primary mechanisms that causes cycle shifts, some studies have explored the effects of [[hormonal contraception]], like [[the pill]], on both women's cycle shifts and other people's ability to detect cycle shifts.

Most studies have reported that hormonal contraceptives weaken or eliminate cycle shifts entirely.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alvergne |first=Alexandra |last2=Lummaa |first2=Virpi |date=2009 |title=Does the contraceptive pill alter mate choice in humans? |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2009.08.003 |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=171–179 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the synthetic hormones present in hormonal contraception that suppress ovulation also suppress the subsequent cognitive and behavioral changes found in naturally-cycling women. Other studies have concluded that changes in synthetic hormones produce cycle shifts similar to effects produced by the real hormonal changes in naturally-cycling women.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grøntvedt |first=Trond Viggo |last2=Grebe |first2=Nicholas M. |last3=Kennair |first3=Leif Edward Ottesen |last4=Gangestad |first4=Steven W. |date=2016 |title=Estrogenic and progestogenic effects of hormonal contraceptives in relation to sexual behavior: insights into extended sexuality |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.10.006 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=283–292 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise effects of each hormone on cycle shifts, and the effects of each synthetic hormone present in different types of contraceptive, are not well understood.

== Alternative hypotheses ==

=== Within-cycle vs. between-cycle shifts ===
While the ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that [[Adaptation|adaptive]] changes in mating-related cognition and behavior occur ''within'' each ovulatory cycle, some researchers have posited a ''between''-cycle shift theory. Many women experience regular [[anovulatory cycle]]s, or non-fertile cycles where ovulation does not occur, therefore hormonal changes between ovulatory cycles may be a more reliable indicator of true fertility, as higher levels of [[estradiol]] are more likely to produce a fertile ovulatory cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435534359 |title=On Fertile Ground: A Natural History of Human Reproduction |last=Ellison |first=Peter |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780674011120 |location=Cambridge, MA |pages= |oclc=435534359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some researchers have proposed that hormonal changes between cycles, primarily in elevated estradiol levels, are responsible for changes in mating-related cognition and behavior.&lt;ref name="Roney 14–19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UComqxHpkJAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=The+role+of+sex+hormones+in+the+initiation+of+human+mating+relationships&amp;ots=kuPOtiRHu7&amp;sig=lY4UpcH0rjcQNTtzrVrDsmWeIxs#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20role%20of%20sex%20hormones%20in%20the%20initiation%20of%20human%20mating%20relationships&amp;f=false |title=Endocrinology of Social Relationships |last=Ellison |first=Peter T. |last2=Gray |first2=Peter B. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780674031173 |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Within-cycle shifts may be simply a byproduct of between-cycle shifts caused by elevated estradiol.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Meta-analyses ===
One [[meta-analysis]] and several reviews of the literature have been conducted on both published and unpublished data that support the claim of the ovulatory shift hypothesis that women experience changes in attraction preferences at high fertility.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, another meta-analysis and subsequent commentary concluded that the effect is not actually significant and may be a result of some studies using imprecise measurements of when women are in the fertile window, as well as [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wood |first=Wendy |last2=Carden |first2=Lucas |title=Elusiveness of menstrual cycle effects on mate preferences: Comment on Gildersleeve, Haselton, and Fales |date=2014 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0036722 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=140 |issue=5 |pages=1265–1271 |doi=10.1037/a0036722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the former meta-analysis subsequently published a [[P-curve|''p''-curve]] analysis, a statistical test which supports the claim that the effects are not a result of publication bias or [[P hacking|''p''-hacking]], and concluded that the methodology used by the latter meta-analysis caused the authors to overlook patterns of robust effects in cycle shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gildersleeve |first=Kelly |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |last3=Fales |first3=Melissa R. |title=Meta-analyses and p-curves support robust cycle shifts in women’s mate preferences: Reply to Wood and Carden (2014) and Harris, Pashler, and Mickes |date=2014 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037714 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=140 |issue=5 |pages=1272–1280 |doi=10.1037/a0037714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy protocols''' are [[Guideline|guildline]]s intended to allow computation while still protecting the individuals involved.  It can be developed from just two individuals trying to discover if they both know the same secret, without leaking information about the secret itself. In this case, after the protocol runs, both individuals will either know that they share the secret, or know that they do not share it; they will have gained no additional information about the other's secret.

==Examples of privacy protocols==
For example, say the secret is a name of a person.  One protocol is to use a random phone number, such as 555-111-2222, then replace the last n digits of the phone number with the secret such as 555-111-JOHN.  Then the first person calls the number and leaves a message with the person on the other end for the second person.  Next the second person calls the number of their secret and asks if there are any messages for him.  One issue with this protocol is that the phone number created might not exist.

Another protocol without this issue is to designate an airline, destination and date, and have the first person make a reservation using the name of their secret, then the second person goes and cancels the reservation using the name of their secret.  If the second person is not successful, then they don't share the secret.

A simple protocol that does not rely on a human third party involves [[password]] changing.  This works anywhere one has to type in new passwords the same twice before the password is changed.  The first individual will type their secret in the first box, and the second person will type their secret in the second box, if the password is successfully changed then the secret is shared.  However the computer is still a third party and must be trusted not to have a [[key logger]].

A more involved protocol that does not involve any reliance on a third party, human or machine, involves ''n'' cups, each with a label of the name of a person that could be the secret.  Each individual will then place a slip of paper under each cup, one slip of paper will say 'yes' on it and will go under the cup with the name of the secret on it, all the other slips will say 'no'.  Then the labels will be removed, the cups shuffled, then flipped over to reveal the slips of paper.  If there is a cup with both slips of paper saying 'yes' on them then they share the secret.

There are many other protocols that involve two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Problem management''' is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems that happen or could happen in an IT service. The primary objectives of problem management are to prevent problems and resulting incidents from happening, to eliminate recurring incidents, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. The [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] defines a problem as the cause of one or more [[incident management|incidents]].

==Scope==
Problem Management includes the activities required to diagnose the [[root cause]] of incidents identified through the [[Incident Management]] process, and to determine the resolution to those problems. It is also responsible for ensuring that the resolution is implemented through the appropriate control procedures, especially [[Change_management_(ITSM)|Change Management]] and [[Release Management]].

Problem Management will also maintain information about problems and the appropriate workarounds and resolutions, so that the organization is able to reduce the number and impact of incidents over time. In this respect, Problem Management has a strong interface with [[Knowledge Management]], and tools such as the [[Known Error Database]] will be used for both. Although Incident Management and Problem Management are separate processes, they are closely related and will typically use the same tools, and may use similar categorization, impact and priority coding systems. This will ensure effective communication when dealing with related incidents and problems.

==Value to business==
Problem Management works together with Incident Management and Change Management to ensure that IT service availability and quality are increased. When incidents are resolved, information about the resolution is recorded. Over time, this information is used to speed up the resolution time and identify permanent solutions, reducing the number and resolution time of incidents. This results in less downtime and less disruption to business critical systems.

==Process activities, methods and techniques==
Problem Management consists of two major processes:
* Reactive Problem Management, which is generally executed as part of [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Service operation|Service Operation]]
* Proactive Problem Management which is initiated in [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Service operation|Service Operation]], but generally driven as part of [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Continual service improvement (CSI)|Continual service improvement (CSI)]].

==Problem detection==
*Suspicion or detection of a cause of one or more incidents by the [[Service Desk]], resulting in a [[Problem Record]] being raised – [[Service Desk]] may have resolved the incident but has not determined a definitive cause and suspects that it is likely to recur.
* Analysis of an incident by a technical support group which reveals that an underlying problem exists, or is likely to exist.
* Automated detection of an infrastructure or application fault, using event/alert tools automatically to raise an incident which may reveal the need for a [[Problem Record]].
* A notification from a supplier or contractor that a problem exists that has to be resolved.
* Analysis of incidents as part of proactive Problem Management: watch-bulletins, releases, relevant papers

==Problem logging==
All the relevant details of the problem must be recorded so that a full historic record exists. This must be date and time stamped to allow suitable control and escalation. A cross-reference must be made to the incident(s) which initiated the "Problem Record":
* Service details
* Equipment details
* Date/time initially logged
* Priority and categorization details
* Incident description
* Details for all diagnostic or attempted recovery actions taken.

==Problem Prioritization==
Problems may be categorized according to their severity and priority in the same way as incidents in order to facilitate their tracking, taking the impact of the associated incidents and their frequency of occurrence into account.
From an infrastructure point of view one may ask:
* Can the system be recovered, or does it need to be replaced?
* How much will it cost?
* How many people will be required to fix the problem?
* How long will it take to fix the problem?
* How many additional resources will be involved?
* What is the impact of '''not''' resolving the problem?

==Problem investigation and diagnosis==
The result of an investigation for a problem will be a root cause diagnosis or a RCA report. The resolution should be the sum of the appropriate level of resources and skills used to find it.
There are a number of useful problem solving techniques that can be used to help diagnosis and resolved problems.

*The '''CMS''' must be used to help determine the level of impact and to assist in pinpointing the point of failure. 
*The [[Known Error Database]] or KEDB should be accessed and checked in order to find out if the problem has occurred in the past, if so a resolution should be already in place.
*The Chronological analysis, the events that trigged the problem will be checked in chronological order in order to have a timeline of events. The purpose is to see which event trigger the next event and so on, or to rule out some possible events.

The '''Pain Value Analysis''' contains a broader view of the impact of an incident or a problem on the business. Rather than analysing the number of incidents/problems of a particular type in a particular time interval, the technique focus on in-depth analysis of what level of pain has been caused to the business by these incidents/problems. A formula to calculate the level of pain should take into account:
* the number of people affected
* the duration of the downtime caused
* the cost to the business

The '''Kepner and Tregoe''' method is used to investigate deeper-rooted problems. They defined the following stages:
* defining the problem
* describing the problem in terms of identity, location, time (duration) and size (impact)
* establishing possible causes
* testing the most probable cause
* verifying the true cause

'''Pareto Analysis''' or [[Pareto chart]] is a technique for separating important potential causes from trivial issues. The following steps should be taken:
# Form a table listing the causes and their frequency as a percentage
# Arrange the rows in the decreasing order of importance of the causes (the most important cause first)
# Add a cumulative percentage column to the table
# Create a bar chart with the causes, in order of their percentage of total
# Draw a line at 80% on the Y-axis, then drop the line at the point of intersection with the X-axis. From the chart you can see the primary causes for the network failures. These should be targeted first.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|+ Network failures
! Causes || Percentage of total || Computation %
|-
| Network Controller || 35 || 0+35% = 35%
|-
| File corruption || 26 || 35% + 26% = 61%
|-
| Server OS || 6|| 61%+6% = 67%
|-
|}

==Known Error Record==
After the investigation is complete and a workaround (or even a permanent solution) has been found, a Known Error Record must be raised and placed in the Known Error Database in order to identify and resolve further similar problems. The main purpose is to restore the affected service as soon as possible with a minimal impact on the business.

A good practice would be to raise a Known Error Record as early in the investigation as possible; once a workaround has been successfully tested or a root cause has been identified.

==Major Problem Review==
A good practice is to have a review for all major problems.
The review should examine:
*The correct steps taken
*The problems encountered during the implementation of the solution
*The need to improve
*Prevent the recurrence of further similar incidents
*Third-Party/Vendor/Supplier involved in the implementation

The knowledge learned from the review should be incorporated into a service review with the business customer to ensure that the customer is aware of the actions taken and the plans to prevent future similar incidents from occurring.This helps to improve customer satisfaction and assure the business that Service Operations is handling major incidents responsibly and actively working to prevent their future recurrence..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12736">In [[psychology]], '''prospection''' is the generation and evaluation of mental representations of possible futures. The term therefore captures a wide array of future-oriented psychological phenomena, including the prediction of future emotion ([[affective forecasting]]), the imagination of future scenarios (episodic foresight), and [[planning]]. Prospection is central to various aspects of human [[cognition]] and [[motivation]]. [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)]] and [[Timothy Wilson]] coined the term in 2007.&lt;ref name=pmid17823345 "Prospection: Experiencing the Future"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert DT, Wilson TD | title = Prospection: Experiencing the future | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5843 | pages = 1351-1354 | date = Sep 2007 | pmid = 17823345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become a central area of enquiry in the [[cognitive sciences]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seligman |first1=Martin E.

== Prospection and learning ==

Even fundamental [[learning]] processes are, in some sense, forms of prospection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=Thomas |last2=Corballis |first2=Michael C. |title=The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=29 October 2007 |volume=30 |issue=03 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X07001975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=D. T. |last2=Wilson |first2=T. D. |title=Prospection: Experiencing the Future |journal=Science |date=7 September 2007 |volume=317 |issue=5843 |pages=1351–1354 |doi=10.1126/science.1144161}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Associative learning]] enables individual animals to track local regularities in their environments and adapt their behaviour accordingly, in order to maximise their chances of positive outcomes and minimise risks. Animals that are capable of positive and negative states (for example pleasure and pain) can eventually learn about the consequences of their actions and thereby predict imminent rewards and punishments before they occur. This enables animals to change their current actions accordingly in line with prospective consequences. 

== Relationship with mental time travel ==
{{Main|Mental time travel}}

[[Mental time travel]] refers to the ability to mentally reconstruct personal events from the past (known as [[episodic memory]]), as well as to imagine personal future events (known as episodic foresight). Mental time travel into the future (episodic foresight or episodic future thinking) is therefore one of several types of ‘prospection’ that refers to the capacity to simulate or imagine personal future events &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=T. |last2=Corballis |first2=M. C. |title=Mental time travel and the evolution of the human mind |journal=Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs |date=1997 |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=133–167 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204544 |issn=8756-7547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szpunar |first1=Karl K. |last2=Spreng |first2=R. Nathan |last3=Schacter |first3=Daniel L. |title=A taxonomy of prospection: Introducing an organizational framework for future-oriented cognition: Fig. 1. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=30 December 2014 |volume=111 |issue=52 |pages=18414–18421 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1417144111}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Examples of the functions of prospection ==

=== Episodic foresight === 
{{Main|Foresight (psychology)}}
Episodic foresight is the capacity to imagine personal future scenarios and shape current action accordingly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=Thomas |last2=Moore |first2=Chris |title=Introduction to the special issue: The development of episodic foresight |journal=Cognitive Development |date=October 2011 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=295–298 |doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2011.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Predicting future emotions (affective forecasting) ===
{{Main|Affective forecasting}}
	
The feelings evoked during episodic foresight enable people to infer how they would really feel if the event were to happen in reality. This thereby enables people to anticipate whether future events are desirable or undesirable, and ability called ‘[[affective forecasting]]’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Timothy D. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel T. |title=Affective Forecasting |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=23 June 2016 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=131–134 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Prospective intentions ===
{{Main|Prospective memory}}
	
Simulating the future enables people to create intentions for future actions. [[Prospective memory]] is the form of memory that involves remembering to perform these planned intentions, or to recall them at some future point in time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Einstein |first1=Gilles O. |last2=McDaniel |first2=Mark A. |title=Normal aging and prospective memory. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |date=1990 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=717–726 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.16.4.717}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Prospective memory tasks are common in everyday life, ranging from remembering to post a letter to remembering to take one’s medication. 

=== Deliberate practice ===
{{Main|Practice (learning method)}}

People anticipate that it is possible to shape their future self. To acquire new knowledge or additional skills, people therefore engage in repeated actions driven by the goal to improve these future capacities. This deliberate practice is essential not only for elite performance but also in the acquirement of numerous everyday feats. 

=== Flexible decision-making ===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}

[[Intertemporal choice|Intertemporal choices]] are choices with outcomes that play out over time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berns |first1=Gregory S. |last2=Laibson |first2=David |last3=Loewenstein |first3=George |title=Intertemporal choice – toward an integrative framework |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=November 2007 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=482–488 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such decisions are ubiquitous in everyday life, ranging from routine decisions about what to eat for lunch (i.e. whether to adhere to a diet) to more profound decisions about [[climate change]] (i.e. whether to reduce current energy expenditure to avoid delayed costs). The ability to imagine future scenarios and adjust decisions accordingly may be important for making intertemporal choices in a flexible manner that accords with delayed consequences. Accumulating evidence suggests that cuing people to imagine the future in vivid detail can encourage preferences for delayed outcomes over immediate ones &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bulley |first1=Adam |last2=Henry |first2=Julie |last3=Suddendorf |first3=Thomas |title=Prospection and the present moment: The role of episodic foresight in intertemporal choices between immediate and delayed rewards. |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=2016 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=29–47 |doi=10.1037/gpr0000061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rung |first1=Jillian M. |last2=Madden |first2=Gregory J. |title=Experimental reductions of delay discounting and impulsive choice: A systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |date=September 2018 |volume=147 |issue=9 |pages=1349–1381 |doi=10.1037/xge0000462}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This has been extended into real-world decisions such as in reducing the consumption of high-calorie food &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dassen |first1=Fania C.M. |last2=Jansen |first2=Anita |last3=Nederkoorn |first3=Chantal |last4=Houben |first4=Katrijn |title=Focus on the future: Episodic future thinking reduces discount rate and snacking |journal=Appetite |date=January 2016 |volume=96 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2015.09.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing pro-environmental behaviours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Pei-Shan |last2=Sung |first2=Yu-Hsien |last3=Wu |first3=Chia-Chun |last4=Ho |first4=Liang-Chu |last5=Chiou |first5=Wen-Bin |title=Using Episodic Future Thinking to Pre-Experience Climate Change Increases Pro-Environmental Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=26 July 2018 |pages=001391651879059 |doi=10.1177/0013916518790590}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Clinical impairment == 

In recent years there have been a range of investigations into variation in prospection and its functions in clinical populations. Deficits to the mechanisms and functions of prospection have been observed in [[Alzheimer’s disease]] and other age-related [[dementias]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Irish |first1=Muireann |last2=Piolino |first2=Pascale |title=Impaired capacity for prospection in the dementias - Theoretical and clinical implications |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |date=March 2016 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=49–68 |doi=10.1111/bjc.12090}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Schizophrenia]], and after brain damage (especially to the [[medial temporal lobe|medial temporal lobes]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henry |first1=Julie D. |last2=Addis |first2=Donna Rose |last3=Suddendorf |first3=Thomas |last4=Rendell |first4=Peter G. |title=Introduction to the Special Issue: Prospection difficulties in clinical populations |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |date=March 2016 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |doi=10.1111/bjc.12108}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Shifts in the content and modes of prospection have been observed in [[affective disorders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacLeod |first1=Andrew |title=Prospection, well-being and memory |journal=Memory Studies |date=30 June 2016 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=266–274 |doi=10.1177/1750698016645233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roepke |first1=Ann Marie |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E. P. |title=Depression and prospection |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |date=March 2016 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=23–48 |doi=10.1111/bjc.12087}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in both clinical [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] there is an overrepresentation of possible negative future events. In depression, there is additionally a reduction in the generation of possible positive future events. There are also a range of changes to the representational format (i.e. whether people tend to represent the future in [[episodic memory|episodic]] or [[semantic]] detail) in affective disorders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miloyan |first1=Beyon |last2=Pachana |first2=Nancy A. |last3=Suddendorf |first3=Thomas |title=The future is here: A review of foresight systems in anxiety and depression |journal=Cognition and Emotion |date=9 December 2013 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=795–810 |doi=10.1080/02699931.2013.863179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bulley |first1=Adam |last2=Henry |first2=Julie D. |last3=Suddendorf |first3=Thomas |title=Thinking about threats: Memory and prospection in human threat management |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |date=March 2017 |volume=49 |pages=53–69 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2017.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">'''Psychic assault''' is a term used by academic legal writers as a synonym for [[assault]] (or [[common assault]]) in order to distinguish that offence from the related crime of [[battery (crime)|battery]] and so avoid confusion. The need for this term arises from the fact that the word assault is frequently used to refer collectively both to that offence and to battery.

The word 'psychic' is used to denote the fact that the [[actus reus]] of the offence that is correctly described as assault consists of affecting the mind of the other person (whereas battery consists of the application of force).

In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''pulation square''' (also called a '''Doolittle diagram''') is a diagram that is simultaneously a [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]] square and a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] square. It is a [[Dual (category theory)|self-dual]] concept.

'''Representational systems''' (also known{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as '''sensory modalities'''{{cn|date=September 2017}} and abbreviated{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to '''VAKOG'''{{cn|date=September 2017}} or known{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as the '''4-tuple'''{{cn|date=September 2017}}) is a postulated model from [[neuro-linguistic programming]],{{cn|date=September 2017}} a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]&lt;ref name="Thyer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Social Work Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nE9FCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;vq=nlp&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|date=2015-05-15|isbn=9780826177698|first1=Bruce A.|last1=Thyer|first2=Monica G.|last2=Pignotti|pages=56–57, 165–167|quote=As NLP became more popular, some research was conducted and reviews of such research have concluded that there is no scientific basis for its methods about representational systems and eye movements.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Sharpley|first= Christopher F.|title= Research findings on neurolinguistic programming: Nonsupportive data or an untestable theory?|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1 January 1987|volume=34|issue=1|pages=103–107|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.34.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; collection of models and methods regarding how the human [[mind]] processes and stores [[information]]. The central idea of this model is that experience is represented in the mind in sensorial terms, i.e. in terms of the putative five senses, qualia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | pages=6–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

According to Bandler and Grinder our chosen words, phrases and sentences are indicative of our referencing of each of the representational systems.&lt;ref name="Bandler 1976 7"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} So for example the words "black", "clear", "spiral" and "image" reference the ''visual'' representation system; similarly the words "tinkling", "silent", "squeal" and "blast" reference the ''auditory'' representation system.&lt;ref name="Bandler 1976 7"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}  Bandler and Grinder also propose that ostensibly metaphorical or figurative language indicates a reference to a representational system such that it is actually ''literal''.  For example, the comment "I see what you're saying" is taken to indicate a visual representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

Further, Bandler and Grinder claim that each person has a "most highly valued" (now commonly termed ''preferred'') representational system in which they are more able to vividly create an experience (in their mind) in terms of that representational system, tend to use that representational system more often than the others, and have more distinctions available in that representation system than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}  So for example a person that most highly values their visual representation system is able to easily and vividly visualise things and has a tendency to do so in preference to creating or recreating an experience in terms of the other representational system.

Representational systems are one of the foundational ideas of NLP and form the basis of many NLP techniques and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | pages=13–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

==Representational systems within NLP==

{{quotation|"At the core of NLP is the belief that, when people are engaged in activities, they are also making use of a representational system; that is, they are using some internal representation of the materials they are involved with, such as a conversation, a rifle shot, a spelling task. These representations can be visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or involve the other senses. In addition, a person may be creating a representation or recalling one. For example, a person asked to spell a word may visualize that word printed on a piece of paper, may hear it being sounded out, or may construct the spelling from the application of a series of logical rules." Daniel Druckman (Ed.) (1988), ''Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques''(pp.138-139)&lt;ref name="druckman"&gt;Druckman (1988), ''Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For many practical purposes, according to NLP,{{who|date=September 2017}} mental processing of events and memories can be treated as if performed by the five senses. For example, [[Einstein]] credited his discovery of [[special relativity]] to a mental visualization strategy of "sitting on the end of a ray of light", and many people as part of decision-making ''talk to themselves'' in their heads.{{synth|date=September 2017}}

The manner in which this is done, and the effectiveness of the [[strategy (NLP)|mental strategy]] employed, is stated by NLP{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to play a critical part in the way mental processing takes place. This observation led to the concept of a ''preferred'' representational system,{{cn|date=September 2017}} the classification of people into fixed ''visual'', ''auditory'' or ''kinesthetic'' [[stereotype]]s. This idea was later discredited{{by whom|date=September 2017}} and dropped within NLP by the early 1980s,{{cn|date=September 2017}} in favor of the understanding that most people use all of their senses (whether consciously or unconsciously), and that whilst one system may seem to dominate, this is often contextualized - globally there is a balance that dynamically varies according to circumstance and mood.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} asserts that for most circumstances and most people, three of the five sensory based modes seem to dominate in mental processing:
* ''[[visual thinking|visual]]'' thoughts - sight, mental imagery, spatial awareness
* ''auditory'' (or linguistic) thoughts - sound, speech, dialog, white noise
* ''kinesthetic'' (or [[proprioception|proprioceptive]]) sense - [[Somatosensory system|somatic]] feelings in the body, temperature, pressure, and also emotion.
The other two senses, gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell), which are closely associated,  often seem to be less significant in general mental processing, and are often considered jointly as one.

For this reason, one often sees the term ''VAK'' in NLP reference texts,{{cn|date=September 2017}} to signify these three primary representational systems, as well as the term ''4-[[tuple]]'' (or ''VAKOG''){{cn|date=September 2017}} if the author wishes to include all senses including taste/smell. The same term is also known as ''First Access'' (John Grinder),&lt;ref name="whispering"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grinder, John  |author2=Carmen Bostic St Clair  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Whispering in the Wind  | location=CA | publisher=J &amp; C Enterprises | year=2001 | pages=127, 171, 222, ch.3, Appendix | id=-}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[primary experience]]'' (Freud){{cn|date=September 2017}}{{synth|date=September 2017}}.

In documenting mental strategies and processing by the senses, NLP practitioners{{who|date=September 2017}} often use a simple shorthand for different modalities, with a letter indicating the representation system concerned, and often, a [[superscript]] to indicate how that system is being used. Three key aspects are commonly notated: The ''representation system'' being used (visual/V, auditory/A, kinesthetic/K, and occasionally, O/G), whether the ''direction of attention'' is internal &lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt; or external &lt;sup&gt;(e)&lt;/sup&gt;, and whether the event is a ''recollection'' of an actual past event &lt;sup&gt;(r)&lt;/sup&gt; or ''construction'' of an imaginary event &lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to its importance in human cognitive processing, auditory internal dialogue, or talking in one's head, has its own shorthand: A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt;.

Putting these together, this is a very simplified example of some steps which might actually be involved in replying to a simple question such as "Do you like that dress?".  The table below is useful for teaching how to identify and access each representational system in context:

:{| class="wikitable" 
|-
! Step !! Activity ||Notation !! What it's being used for
|-
| 1 || auditory external || A&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || Hear the question
|-
| 2 || visual internal || V&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; || picture to oneself the ''meaning'' of the question
|-
| 3 || visual external || V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || look at the dress
|-
| 4 || visual internal constructed || V&lt;sup&gt;ic&lt;/sup&gt; || create a mental image of the dress worn by the person
|-
| 5 || kinesthetic internal || K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; || get an internal feeling from looking at it
|-
| 6 || [[Intrapersonal communication|auditory internal dialog]] || A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt; || ask oneself 'Do I like that impression?'
|-
| 7 || auditory external || A&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || reply
|-
|}

Logically, these or similar steps ''must'' take place somewhere in consciousness in order to cognitively make sense of the question and answer it.{{cn|date=September 2017}} A sequence of this kind is known{{by whom|date=September 2017}} in NLP as a ''[[strategy (NLP)|strategy]]'' - in this case, a functional outline of the strategy used by the mind in answering that question. In a similar way, the process leading to a panic attack of the form "I see the clock, ask myself where the kids are, imagine everything that could be happening and feel scared" might be notated as having a subjective structure: V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; → A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt; → V&lt;sup&gt;ic&lt;/sup&gt; → K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;, signifying that an external sight leads to internal dialog (a question), followed by internal and constructed images, leading to a feeling.

Generally speaking, most human perceptual and cognitive processing occurs before conscious awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/|title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis|last=Heuer, Jr.|first=Richards|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence|year=1999|isbn=1-929667-00-0|location=|pages=1|quote=A basic finding of cognitive psychology is that people have no conscious experience of most of what happens in the human mind. Many functions associated with perception, memory, and information processing are conducted prior to and independently of any conscious direction. What appears spontaneously in consciousness is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline}} For example, few people would ordinarily be aware that between question and even considering an answer, there must be steps in which the mind interprets and contextualizes the question itself, and steps which explore various possible strategies to be used to obtain an answer and select one to be followed.{{cn|date=September 2017}} The mental occurrence of these steps is often identified by deduction following skilled observation, or by careful inquiry, although their presence is usually self-apparent to the person concerned once noticed.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Sensory predicates and eye accessing cues===
Grinder and Bandler believed they identified pattern of relationship between the sensory-based language people use in general conversation, and for example, their eye movement (known as ''eye accessing cues'').&lt;ref name="frogs"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bandler, Richard  |author2=John Grinder  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press | year=1979 | id=- | url= | pages=15, 24, 30, 45,52. | isbn=0-911226-18-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

A common (but not universal) style of processing in the [[Western culture|West]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} is shown in the attached chart, where ''eye flickers'' in specific directions often seem to tie into specific kinds of internal (mental) processing.

NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} also suggests that sometimes (again not universally) such processing is associated with sensory word use; for example, a person asked what they liked about the beach, may flick their eyes briefly in some characteristic direction (visual memory access, often upwards) and then also use words that describe it in a visual sense ("The sea ''looked'' lovely", and so on). Likewise asked about a problem, someone may look in a different direction for a while (kinesthetic access, typically downwards) and then look puzzled and say "I just can't seem to ''get a grip'' on things". Taken together, NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} suggests such eye accessing cues (1) are idiosyncratic and habitual for each person, and (2) may form significant clues as to how a person is processing or representing a problem to themselves unconsciously.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Mouvements-oculaires-PNL.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|The most common arrangement for eye accessing cues in a right-handed person.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Note: - NLP does ''not'' say it is 'always' this way, but rather that one should check whether reliable correlations seem to exist for an individual, and if so what they are'']] 
Common (but not universal) Western layout of eye accessing cues:
* Upwards (left/right) -- Visual (V) -- "I can ''imagine'' the big ''picture''"
* Level (left/right) -- Auditory (A) --  "Let's ''tone'' down the ''discussion''"
* Down-right—Kinesthetic (K) -- "to ''grasp'' a concept" or "to ''gather'' you've understood."
* Down-left [[Intrapersonal communication|Auditory internal dialogue]] (A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt;) -- talking to oneself inside

Eye movement to the left or right for many people seems to indicate if a memory was recalled or constructed.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Thus remembering an actual image (V&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;) is associated more with up-left, whilst imagining one's dream home (V&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;) tends (again not universally) to be more associated with up-right.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Subjective awareness===
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}
When we think about the world, or about our past experiences, we represent those things inside our heads.{{cn|date=September 2017}} For example, think about the holiday you went on last year. Did you see a picture of where you went, tell yourself a story about what you did, feel the sun on your back and the wind in your hair? Can you bring to mind the smell of your favourite flower or the taste of a favourite meal??

The use of the various modalities can be identified based by learning to respond to subtle shifts in breathing, body posture, accessing cues, gestures, eye movement and language patterns such as sensory predicates.&lt;ref name="nlpvol1" &gt;{{cite book | author=Dilts, Robert B, Grinder, John, Bandler, Richard &amp; DeLozier, Judith A. | title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I - The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience | publisher=Meta Publications, 1980. . | year=1980 | url= | id=. | pages=3–4, 6, 14, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="diltsdelozier2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dilts, Robert B, DeLozier, Judith A | title=Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher=NLP University Press | year=2000 | url=http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | isbn=0-9701540-0-3 | pages=75, 383, 729, 938–943, 1003, 1300, 1303}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

===Uses===
NLP's interest in the senses is not so much in their role as bridges to the outside world, but in their role as internal channels for cognitive processing and interpretation.{{cn|date=September 2017}} In an NLP perspective,{{weasel inline|date=September 2017}} it is not very important ''per se'' whether a person ''sees'' or ''hears'' some memory.{{cn|date=September 2017}} By contrast, NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} views it as potentially of great importance for the same person, to discover that some auditory sounds presented almost out of consciousness along with the memory, may be how the brain presents to consciousness, and how consciousness ''knows'', whether this is a heart-warming pleasant memory, or a fearsome phobic one.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Representational systems are also relevant since some tasks are better performed within one representational system than by another. For example, within education, spelling is better learned by children who have unconsciously used a strategy of visualization, than an unconscious strategy of phonetically "sounding out". When taught to visualize, previously poor spellers can indeed be taught to improve.&lt;ref name="Bandler 1979 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | title=Frogs into princes : neuro linguistic programming | publisher=Real People Press | location=Moab, Utah | year=1979 | isbn=978-0-911226-19-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} NLP proponents also found that pacing and leading the various cues tended to build [[rapport (NLP)|rapport]], and allowed people to communicate more effectively. Certain studies suggest that using similar representational systems to another person can help build rapport&lt;ref name="James W. Pennebaker"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pennebaker, J. |author2=Ireland, Molly |author3=Slatcher, Richard |author4=Eastwick, Paul |author5=Scissors, Lauren |author6=Finkel, Eli  |lastauthoramp=yes | title= Language Style Matching Predicts Relationship Initiation and Stability | journal= Psychological Science | year= 2011 | pages= 39–44 | volume= 22 | issue = January | url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/1.toc | doi=10.1177/0956797610392928 | pmid=21149854}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst other studies have found that merely mimicking or doing so in isolation is perceived negatively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==The preferred representational system (PRS)==

Originally NLP taught that people preferred one representational system over another. People could be stuck by thinking about a problem in their "preferred representational system" (PRS). Some took this idea further and categorised people as [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]], [[kinesthetic]], and [[Visual thinking|visual thinkers]] (see also: [[learning styles]]). It was claimed that swifter and more effective results could be achieved by matching this preferred system. Although there is some research that supports the notion that eye movement can indicate visual and auditory (but not kinesthetic) components of thought in that moment,&lt;ref name="Buckner 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckner | last2 = Meara| last3= Reese|last4= Reese | year = 1987 | title =  Eye movement as an indicator of sensory components in thought.| doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.34.3.283 | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 283–287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synth|date=September 2017}} the existence of a preferred representational system ascertainable from external cues (an important part of original NLP theory) was discounted by research in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpley | first1 = C.

In particular, [[New Code of NLP|new code]] emphasizes  individual calibration and sensory acuity, precluding such a rigidly specified model as the one described above.&lt;ref name="Grinder_1996"/&gt; Responding directly to sensory experience requires an immediacy which respects the importance of context. [[John Grinder]] has stated that a representational system diagnosis lasts about 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="Grinder_1996"&gt;Grinder, J. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, The [[United States National Research Council|National Research Committee]] found little support for the influence of PRS as presented in early descriptions of NLP, Frogs into Princes (1979) and Structure of Magic (1975). However, "at a meeting with [[Richard Bandler]] in Santa Cruz, California, on July 9, 1986, the [National Research Committee] influence subcommittee... was informed that PRS was no longer considered an important component of NLP. He said that NLP had been revised." (p.&amp;nbsp;140)&lt;ref name="druckman"/&gt; The NLP developers, Robert Dilts et al. (1980) &lt;ref name="nlpvol1" /&gt; proposed that eye movement (and sometimes bodily gesture) correspond to accessing cues for representations systems, and connected it to specific sides in the brain.

{{nihongo|'''Sada Abe'''|阿部 定|Abe Sada|extra=May 28, 1905 – after 1971}} was a [[Japanese woman]], a [[geisha]] and prostitute, who is remembered for [[erotic asphyxiation|erotically asphyxiating]] her lover, {{nihongo|'''Kichizō Ishida'''|石田 吉蔵}}, on May 18, 1936, and then cutting off his [[penis]] and [[testicle]]s and carrying them around with her in her [[kimono]]. The story became a national sensation in Japan, acquiring mythic overtones, and has been interpreted by artists, philosophers, novelists and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Thompson-1570"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1985|p=1570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abe was released after having served 5 years in prison and went on to write an autobiography.

==Family background==
Sada Abe was the seventh of eight children of Shigeyoshi and Katsu Abe, an [[upper middle-class]] family of [[tatami|tatami mat]] makers in Tokyo's [[Kanda, Tokyo|Kanda]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; Only four of the Abe children survived to adulthood, and of those, Sada was the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's father, Shigeyoshi Abe, was originally from [[Chiba Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; He had been adopted into the Abe family to help with the business, which he eventually inherited.&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; Aged 52 at the time of Sada's birth, Shigeyoshi Abe was described by police as "an honest and upright man" who had neither conspicuous vices nor any brushes with the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=20, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some acquaintances reported him to be somewhat self-centered, with a taste for extravagance. Sada's mother, Katsu Abe, likewise had no known legal or moral blemishes on her record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother Shintarō was known as a womanizer, and after his marriage, ran away with his parents' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sada's sister Teruko was also known to have had several lovers. Her father sent her to work in a [[brothel]], then not an uncommon way to punish female sexual promiscuity in Japan, although he soon bought her back. Teruko's past was not considered a hindrance to marriage for those of the Abes' class at the time, and she soon married.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"&gt;{{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sada Abe was born in 1905.&lt;ref name="Johnston-25"/&gt; Her mother doted on Sada, who was her youngest surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the ''[[shamisen]]'', both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with [[geisha|geishas]] and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time,&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintarō, became more pressing, Abe was often sent out of the house alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Sada quoted in ''Second Interrogation of Abe Sada'' in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=169}} Chapter "Notes from the Police Interrogation of Abe Sada": ''While we were playing around on the second floor he forced himself into me.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Sada quoted in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=45}}, Chapter 5. "Acquaintance Rape", ''.. in the summer of my fifteenth year because I was raped by a student at a friend's house&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; As she became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in [[Yokohama]] in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=58}}, {{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe's encounter with the geisha world proved to be a frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity, and eventually contracted [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, as would a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter that better-paying profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=66-67}}, {{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 1930s==
[[File:TAISHO-ROU 大正楼、阿部定が最後に勤めた遊郭、P9200158.JPG|thumb|alt=|The brothel where Abe was arrested]]
Abe began work as a prostitute in [[Osaka]]'s famous [[Tobita Shinchi|Tobita brothel district]], but soon gained a reputation as a trouble-maker. She stole money from clients, and attempted to leave the brothel several times, but was soon tracked down by the well-organized legal prostitution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=67-71}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, she eventually succeeded in escaping the licensed prostitution system, and began working as a waitress. However, not satisfied with the wages, she was soon working as a prostitute again, though now unlicensed, and began working in the unlicensed brothels of Osaka in 1932. Abe's mother died in January 1933, and Abe traveled to Tokyo to visit her father, and her mother's grave. She entered into the prostitution market in Tokyo and while there became a mistress for the first time. When her father became gravely ill in January 1934, Abe nursed him for ten days until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1934 Abe was arrested in a police raid on the unlicensed brothel at which she was working at the time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long&amp;nbsp;... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Deposition by Kasahara Kinnosuke in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=165-166}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for [[Nagoya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nagoya in 1935, and again intending to leave the sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Gorō Ōmiya, a professor and banker who aspired to become a member of the [[Diet of Japan]] (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Ōmiya met Abe in Tokyo, and, finding that she had in the past contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in [[Kusatsu, Gunma|Kusatsu]] from November until January 1936. In January, Ōmiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=78–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquaintance with Kichizō Ishida==
Back in Tokyo, Abe began work as an apprentice at the Yoshidaya restaurant on February 1, 1936. The owner of this establishment, Kichizō Ishida, 42 at the time, had worked his way up in business, starting as an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in eel dishes. He had opened the Yoshidaya in Tokyo's [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] neighborhood in 1920.&lt;ref name="Johnston-11"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abe joined his restaurant, Ishida had become known as a womanizer who by that time did little in the way of actually running the restaurant, which had become in fact managed primarily by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous advances towards her. Ōmiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, and she gave in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant to the accompaniment of a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936, Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or ''machiai''—the contemporary equivalent of a [[love hotel]]&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] neighborhood. Planning only for a short "fling", the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of [[Futako Tamagawa]] where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve [[sake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=84–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Ishida, Abe later said, "It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=92, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their two-week encounter ended, Abe became agitated and began drinking excessively. She said that with Ishida she had come to know true love for the first time in her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=95–99, 192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Abe Sada Incident"==

[[File:The scene of the Abe Sada Incident.JPG|thumb|Site of the "Abe Sada Incident"]]
Ishida and Abe returned to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife to the base of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her ''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'' sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during [[orgasm]], and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a [[sedative]] called [[Bromisoval|Calmotin]] to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you&amp;nbsp;... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=99–102, 164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the morning of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, "After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, and I felt a sense of clarity." After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his genitalia with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=102–103, 200–201, 206, {{harvnb|Honjo}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the blood she wrote {{nihongo||定、石田の吉二人キリ|''Sada, Ishida no Kichi Futari-kiri''|"We, Sada and Kichi(zō) Ishida, are alone"}} on Ishida's left [[thigh]], and on a bed sheet. She then carved {{lang|ja|定}} ("Sada", the [[kanji|character]] for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8&amp;nbsp;a.m., telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-186"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After leaving the inn, Abe met her former lover Gorō Ōmiya. She repeatedly apologized to him, but Ōmiya, unaware of the murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe's apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association with her was bound to cause. After Ishida's body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. Ōmiya's career was ruined, and Abe's life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abe Sada panic==
The circumstances of the death of Ishida immediately caused a national sensation. The ensuing frenzy over the search for Abe was called "Abe Sada panic".&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Police received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a stampede in the [[Ginza]], resulting in a large traffic jam.&lt;ref name="Johnston-11"/&gt; In a reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo, the [[February 26 Incident|Ni Ni-Roku Incident]] ("2–26" or "February 26"), the crime was satirically dubbed the "Go Ichi-Hachi" Incident ("5–18" or "May 18").&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"/&gt;

On May 19, 1936, Abe went shopping and saw a movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in [[Shinagawa]] on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Ōmiya, a friend, and Ishida.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-186"/&gt; She planned to commit suicide one week after the murder, and practiced [[necrophilia]]. "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me&amp;nbsp;... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on [[Mount Ikoma]] while holding on to his penis."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:00 in the afternoon, police detectives, suspicious of the alias under which Abe had registered, came to her room. "Don't be so formal", she told them, "You're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well that's me. I am Sada Abe." When the police were not convinced, she displayed Ishida's genitalia as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe was arrested and interrogated over eight sessions.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-187"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interrogating officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way."&lt;ref name="Johnston-124"/&gt; Her answer was: "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan,{{cn|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;A book, ''19 nin no Abe Sada'' (''19 Abe Sadas''), detailing similar cases, was published in 1981; and Schreiber, "O-Sada Serves a Grateful Nation" mentions at least 53 cases of women severing male genitalia since the Abe case.&lt;/ref&gt; William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred at a time when the Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the [[February 26 Incident|''Ni-Ni-Roku'' incident]] and a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|looming full-scale war in China]]. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"/&gt; The incident also struck a chord with the ''[[ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]]'' ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the details of the crime were made public, rumors began to circulate that Ishida's penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, "Ishida's was just average. [Abe] told me, 'Size doesn't make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were what I liked about Ishida.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Johnston-124"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her arrest, Ishida's penis and testicles were moved to [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo University]] Medical School's pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of [[World War II]], but have since disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=190}}, {{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and sentencing==
The first day of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. crowds were already gathering to attend.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"/&gt; The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, "The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert&amp;nbsp;... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 1936, Abe was convicted of murder in the second degree and mutilation of a corpse. Though the prosecution demanded ten years, and Abe claimed that she desired the death penalty, she was in fact sentenced to just six years in prison.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"/&gt; She was confined in Tochigi women's penitentiary, where she was prisoner No. 11.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] on November 10, 1940, on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary celebrations of the mythical founding of Japan, when [[Emperor Jimmu]] came to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released, exactly five years after the murder, on May 17, 1941.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt;

The police record of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe's story within the context of the {{nihongo|''dokufu''|毒婦}} or "poison woman" stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the popular "poison woman" literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. [[Kanno Suga]], who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate [[Emperor Meiji]] in what was known as the [[High Treason Incident]], wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fumiko Kaneko]], who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for her victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Upon release from prison, Abe assumed an [[pseudonym|alias]]. &lt;!--what years?--&gt;As the mistress of a "serious man" she referred to in her memoirs as "Y", she moved first to [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] and then to [[Saitama Prefecture]]. When Abe's true identity became known to Y's friends and family, she broke off their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=148-150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the [[Shigeru Yoshida|Yoshida]] government encouraged a "3-S" policy—"sports, screen, and sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLelland|2012|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-war writings, such as ''The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada'' (1937) depict Abe as an example of the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=136, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The ''[[buraiha]]'' writer [[Sakunosuke Oda|Oda Sakunosuke]] wrote two stories based on Abe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a "mountain" of erotic books.&lt;ref name="Marran 2007, p. 140-141"&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 the writer [[Ango Sakaguchi]] interviewed Abe, treating her as an authority on both sexuality and freedom. Sakaguchi called Abe a "tender, warm figure of salvation for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Ichiro Kimura's ''The Erotic Confessions of Abe Sada'' became a national best-seller, with over 100,000 copies sold.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt; The book was in the form of an interview with Sada Abe, but was actually based on the police interrogation records. As a response to this book, Abe wrote her own autobiography, ''Memoirs of Abe Sada'', which was published in 1948. In contrast to Kimura's depiction of her as a pervert, she stressed her love for Ishida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the magazine {{nihongo|''True Story''|実話|Jitsuwa}}, in January 1948, featured previously unpublished photos of the incident with the headline "[[Ero guro|Ero-guro]] of the Century! First Public Release. Pictorial of the Abe Sada Incident." Reflecting the change in tone in writings on Abe, the June 1949 issue of ''Monthly Reader'' calls her a "Heroine of That Time", for following her own desires in a time of "false morality" and oppression.&lt;ref name="Marran 2007, p. 140-141"/&gt;

Abe capitalized on her notoriety by sitting for an interview in a popular magazine,&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt; and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called ''Shōwa Ichidai Onna'' (''A Woman of the Shōwa Period'') under the direction of dramatist [[Nagata Mikihiko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; a working-class pub in Inari-chō in downtown Tokyo. She lived a low-profile life in Tokyo's Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a "model employee" award.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic [[Donald Richie]] visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, ''Japanese Portraits'', he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led into the middle of the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, "Hide the knives!" and "I'm afraid to go and pee!" Abe would slap the banister in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, "...&amp;nbsp;she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. There was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richie|1987|pp=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Abe appeared in the "Sada Abe Incident" section of director [[Teruo Ishii]]'s dramatized documentary {{nihongo|''History of Bizarre Crimes by Women in the Meiji Taishō and Shōwa Eras''|明治大正昭和　猟奇女犯罪史|Meiji Taishō Shōwa Ryōki Onna Hanzaishi}},&lt;ref name="Ishii-JMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1969/cs002880.htm |script-title=ja:明治大正昭和　猟奇女犯罪史 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrEjlO7r?url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1969/cs002880.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last known photograph of Abe was taken in August of that year.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1969 picture of Abe, age 64, seated next to a tense male dancer can be seen at: {{cite web |url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/%7Emd5s-kzo/abesada.html |title=SADA ABE 阿部定 |accessdate=2007-07-28 |language=Japanese |publisher=asahi-net.or.jp |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrElM1tu?url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She disappeared from the public eye in 1970.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; When the film ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' was being planned in the mid-1970s, director [[Nagisa Oshima]] apparently sought out Abe and, after a long search, found her, her hair shorn, in a [[Kansai]] nunnery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richie|1987|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Decades after both the incident and her disappearance, Sada Abe continues to draw public interest. In addition to the documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language ''In the Realm of the Senses'', at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, ''Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei'', made use of Abe's name in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287688/ |title=Sexy doll: Abe Sada sansei |accessdate=2007-07-28 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrElpv0h?url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287688/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan,&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"/&gt; and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston's ''Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan'', was published in 2005.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Japanese [[Noise music]]ian [[Merzbow]] adopted the alias Abe Sada for an early musical project. He released only one record under this name, the 1994 7" ''[[Original Body Kingdom/Gala Abe Sada 1936]]''.&lt;ref name=Discogs-Abe-Sada&gt;{{cite web|title=Abe Sada-Original Body Kingdom / Gala Abe Sada 1936|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/359309|work=Discogs Abe Sada discography|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, a four-bass [[noise rock|noise]] band from [[Perth, Western Australia]], named Abe Sada won a Contemporary Music Grant from the Australian Department of Culture and the Arts to tour Japan in June and July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928100148/http://www.dca.wa.gov.au/ContemporaryMusicGrantResults.asp|archivedate=2007-09-28|url=http://www.dca.wa.gov.au/ContemporaryMusicGrantResults.asp|title=Contemporary Music Grant Results|accessdate=2006-06-02|publisher=Department of Culture and the Arts, Government of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the site's author is celebrated in the 2012 novel ''The Master Blaster'' by writer and former Saipan [[Peace Corps]] Volunteer [[P. F.

== Content ==
[[File:SaipanSucks--logo.png|thumb|265px|Image of one of the dozens of variants of the ''Saipan Sucks'' logo. Other versions contain different sayings under the main caption "Welcome to Saipan". The website also makes available for purchase [[t-shirts]] and other [[paraphernalia]] featuring the logo and above saying.]]

''Saipan Sucks'' seeks to call attention to what it alleges to be systemic societal problems in the CNMI that are supported by misuse of United States taxpayer money.

Nepotism rules on the islands. Fueled by money paid by American taxpayers and diverted to the far-off territory, politicians run for office primarily for the sake of being in a position to appoint their relatives to high-paying sinecures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The website presents allegations of [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[racism]], [[nepotism]], [[jury-rigging]], [[exploitation of labour|worker exploitation]], [[employment discrimination]], and mismanagement of the CNMI [[tourism]] industry by local CNMI officials, and seeks to warn U.S. mainlanders about moving to the islands to accept employment offers.&lt;ref name=SlursSaipan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beautify/&gt;&lt;ref name=CounterCritical/&gt;&lt;ref name="east-west"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AuthorUnknown/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssaboutsaipan"/&gt;

== Criticism ==

Since July 2001, shortly after ''Saipan Sucks'' was created, CNMI government officials criticized the website's [[Anonymity#Issues facing the anonymous|anonymity]] and characterized it as a "[[smear campaign]]". Stemming from its reported investigations, the CNMI government has threatened to [[lawsuit|sue]] the website's author for [[libel]] or [[defamation]].&lt;ref name=SlursSaipan/&gt;&lt;ref name=AuthorUnknown/&gt;&lt;ref name="st:7-27-01"&gt;{{Cite web

In November 2006, a local [[environmental group]], Beautify CNMI!, decried the website's high [[PageRank]] in search engines such as [[Google]], and the fact that anyone who searches with the [[Keyword (Internet search)|keyword]] "Saipan" could find the website in the top-ten search result positions. The group published a plan to counter the website's ranking through a campaign of [[linkspam]]ming via [[Google bomb]]ing and [[anchor text|text anchoring]].&lt;ref name=Beautify/&gt;&lt;ref name=CounterCritical/&gt;&lt;ref name="east-west"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sb:5-24-06"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.taotaotasi.com/2006/05/lets-do-something-about-saipan-sucks.html |title=Let's Do Something About Saipan Sucks! |accessdate=2006-11-23 |work=The Saipan Blog |date=May 24, 2006 |first=Angelo |last=Villagomez |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002073755/http://www.taotaotasi.com/2006/05/lets-do-something-about-saipan-sucks.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }} Villagomez is Restoration Chairman of Beautify CNMI!

All along, counter-critics who are either [[Chamorros]] (indigenous people of Saipan) or those otherwise knowledgeable about the CNMI have maintained that, although ''Saipan Sucks'' uses [[hyperbole]] as a [[literary device]], much or most of what it states is true and should be heeded.&lt;ref name="msncache"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cc.msnscache.com/cache.aspx?q=4779841890975&amp;lang=en-US&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=CVRE |title=Putting things in perspective |accessdate=2006-11-24 |publisher=Beautify CNMI! |date=Nov 16, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st:7-26-01"&gt;{{Cite web

== Author ==
''Saipan Sucks'' was written by a person or persons going by the pseudonym "Forgetabilia". Reported investigations carried out by the CNMI government in July 2001 led to an alleged belief about a real identity behind this persona.&lt;ref name=AuthorUnknown/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID%3D13528 |title=Betz denies allegations |first=Marian A. |last=Maraya |date=May 11, 2001 |work=[[Saipan Tribune]] |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202614/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=13528 |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on November 16, 2006, a CNMI [[Daily newspaper|daily]] alleged that ''Saipan Sucks'' was written by a former CNMI Assistant [[Attorney General]], who the daily reported as having "disliked his position" in the CNMI.&lt;ref name=Beautify/&gt; The same day, a regional publication denied the claim, reiterating that the author or authors remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="east-west"/&gt; ''Saipan Sucks'' closes by stating, "As for the authors of this essay, our days in [[Micronesia]] have ended … In all likelihood we shall remain happily for the rest of our days ensconced in anonymous [[Long Island|Longnesia]], suffering, with a little luck, from a selective am-nesia.  Hence our name – Forgetabilia."&lt;ref name="ssaboutsaipan"/&gt;

John Gibbon originally proposed SET to explain the temporally controlled behavior of non-human subjects.&lt;ref name=gibbon /&gt; He initially used the model to account for a pattern of behavior seen in animals that are being reinforced at fixed-intervals, for example every 2 minutes. &lt;ref name="Magaro2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Michael Magaro|title=Dissociating Clock Speed and Attention in the Modality Effect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3aDgdkSx_IC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=11 January 2013|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-47717-4|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An animal that is well trained on such a fixed-interval schedule pauses after each reinforcement and then suddenly starts responding about two-thirds of the way through the new interval. (See [[operant conditioning]]) The model explains how the animal's behavior is controlled by time in this manner. &lt;ref name=gibbon /&gt; Gibbon and others later elaborated the model and applied it to a variety of other timing phenomena.

==Summary of the model==
SET assumes that the animal has a clock, a working memory, a reference memory, and a decision process.  The clock contains a discrete pacemaker that generates pulses like the ticks a mechanical clock. A stimulus that signals the start of a timed interval closes a switch, allowing pulses to enter an accumulator. The resulting accumulation of pulses represents elapsed time, and this time value is continuously sent to a working memory. When reinforcement happens at the end of the timed interval, the time value is stored in a long-term reference memory.  This time-to-reinforcement in reference memory represents the expected time to reinforcement.

Key to the SET model is the decision process that controls timing behavior. While the animal is timing some interval it continually compares the current time (stored in working memory) to the expected time (stored in reference memory). Specifically, the animal continually samples from its memory of past times at which reinforcement occurred and compares this memory sample with the current time on its clock. When the two values are close to one another the animal responds; when they are far enough apart, the animal stops responding. To make this comparison, it computes the ratio of the two values; when the ratio is less than a certain value it responds, when the ratio is larger it does not respond.

By using a ratio of current time to expected time, rather than, for example, simply subtracting one from the other, SET accounts for a key observation about animal and human timing. That is, timing accuracy is relative to the size of the interval being timed. This is the "scalar" property that gives the model its name. For example, when timing a 10 sec interval an animal might be accurate to within 1 sec, whereas when timing a 100 sec interval the animal would be accurate to only about 10 sec. Thus time perception is like the perception of lights, sounds, and other sensory events, where accuracy also is relative to the size (brightness, loudness, etc.) of the percept being judged. (See [[Weber-Fechner law]].)

A number of alternative models of timing have appeared over the years.  These include Killeen’s Behavioral Theory of timing (BeT) model&lt;ref&gt;Killeen, P. R. (1991). Behavior’s time. In G. Bower (Ed.),''The psychology of learning and motivation'' (Vol. 27, pp. 294–334). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Machado’s learning-to-time (LeT) model.&lt;ref&gt;Machado, A., &amp; Pata, P. (2005). Testing the Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) and the Learning to Time model (LeT) in a double bisection task. ''Behavior and Learning'', 33, 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human mechanism==
In 1993, John Wearden claimed that human behavior exhibits appropriate scalar properties, as was indicated by experiments on internal production with concurrent chronometric counting.&lt;ref name="PastorArtieda1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.A. Pastor|author2=J. Artieda|title=Time, Internal Clocks and Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ti3HXG_0OdIC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=10 June 1996|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-054304-8|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human timing behavior is undoubtedly more varied than animal timing behavior. A major factor responsible for this variability is attentional allocation.&lt;ref name="PastorArtieda1996" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hallez, Q., &amp; Droit-Volet, S. (2017). High levels of time contraction in young children in dual tasks are related to their limited attention capacities. ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 161, 148-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''science of morality''' may refer to various forms of [[ethical naturalism]] grounding [[morality]] in rational, [[empirical]] consideration of the natural world.&lt;ref name="sep-naturalism-moral"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Lenman |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Moral Naturalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/naturalism-moral/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Moral science may refer to the consideration of what is best for, and how to maximize the [[flourishing]] of, either particular individuals&lt;ref&gt;Carrier&lt;/ref&gt; or all conscious creatures.&lt;ref name="tedharris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Moral Landscape'', pp. 39ff&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that "morality" can be appropriately defined on the basis of fundamental premises necessary for ''any'' empirical, secular, and philosophical discussion and that societies can use the methods of science to provide answers to moral questions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Daleiden ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations''; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', 2010; and Richard Carrier ''Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = In sum, from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on [[David Hume|Hume]]’s warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences.

The norms advocated by moral scientists (e.g. rights to [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], and [[drug liberalization]] under certain circumstances) would be founded upon the shifting and growing collection of human understanding.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;  Even with science's admitted degree of ignorance, and the various semantic issues, moral scientists can meaningfully discuss things as being ''almost certainly'' "better" or "worse" for promoting flourishing.&lt;ref name=HarrisFlourishing&gt;Sam Harris (2010), page 183: "Much of the skepticism I encounter when speaking about these issues comes from people who think "happiness" is a superficial state of mind and that there are far more important things in life than "being happy." Some reasers may think that concepts like "well-being" and "flourishing" are similarly effete. However, I don't know of any better terms with which to signify the most positive states of being to which we can aspire. One of the virtues of thinking about a moral landscape, the heights of which remain to be discovered, is that it frees us from these semantic difficulties. Generally speaking, we need only worry about what it will mean to move "up" as opposed to "down".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In philosophy===
[[Utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] discussed some of the ways moral investigations are a science.&lt;ref&gt;''Deontology, or The Science of Morality''&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes [[Deontology|deontological ethics]] for failing to recognize that it needed to make the same presumptions as his science of morality to really work – whilst pursuing rules that were to be obeyed in every situation (something that worried Bentham).

[[W.V.O. Quine]] advocated naturalizing epistemology by looking to natural sciences like psychology for a full explanation of knowledge.{{explain|date=October 2015}} His work contributed to a resurgence of moral naturalism in the last half of the 20th century. [[Paul Kurtz]], who believes that the careful, secular pursuit of normative rules is vital to society, coined the term ''eupraxophy'' to refer to his approach to normative ethics. [[Steven Pinker]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Peter Singer]] believe that we learn what is right and wrong through reason and empirical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/steven-pinker-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate1&gt;At 11:25 in the video debate at http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Ossowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Maria Ossowska]] used the methods of science to understand the origins of moral norms.]]
[[Maria Ossowska]] thought that sociology was inextricably related to philosophical reflections on morality, including normative ethics. She proposed that science analyze: (a) existing social norms and their history, (b) the psychology of morality, and the way that individuals interact with moral matters and prescriptions, and (c) the sociology of morality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/3/311 Marcin T. Zdrenka. (2006). "Moral philosopher or sociologist of morals?". Journal of Classical Sociology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular literature===
The theory and methods of a normative science of morality are explicitly discussed in Joseph Daleiden's ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations'' (1998). Daleiden's book, in contrast to Harris, extensively discusses the relevant philosophical literature.  In ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'', [[Sam Harris]]'s goal is to show how moral truth can be backed by "science", or more specifically, [[empirical knowledge]], critical thinking, philosophy, but most controversially, the [[scientific method]].

[[Patricia Churchland]] offers that, accepting [[David Hume|Hume]]'s [[Is–ought problem|is-ought problem]], the use of induction from premises and definitions remains a valid way of reasoning in life and science.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Our moral behavior, while more complex than the social behavior of other animals, is similar in that it represents our attempt to manage well in the existing social ecology....from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on Hume's warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences....The truth seems to be that values rooted in the circuitry for caring—for well-being of self, offspring, mates, kin, and others—shape social reasoning about many issues: conflict resolutions, keeping the peace, defense, trade, resource distribution, and many other aspects of social life in all its vast richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia Smith |last=Churchland |year=2011 |title=Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13703-2 |lccn=2010043584 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLsIzyFR08IC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Patricia Churchland|Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality}}

Daleiden and [[Leonard Carmichael]] warn that science is probabilistic, and that [[certainty]] is not possible. One should therefore expect that moral prescriptions will change as humans gain understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p502, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|To quote Carmichael: "We do not turn aside from what we know about astronomy at any time because there is still a great deal we do not know, or because so much of what we once thought we knew is no longer recognized as true. May not the same argument be accepted in our thinking about ethical and esthetic judgements?"&lt;ref&gt;Leaonard Carmichael, the chapter "Absolutes, Relativism and the Scientific Psychology of Human Nature", H. Schoeck and J. Wiggins (eds), in the book "Relativism and the Study of Man, Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand, 1961, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

==Views in scientific Morality==
{{See also|Moral psychology}}

===Training to promote good behaviour===
The science of morality may aim to discover the best ways to motivate and shape individuals. Methods to accomplish this include instilling explicit [[virtue]]s, building [[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|character strengths]], and forming [[Association (psychology)|mental associations]]. These generally require some level of practical reason. James Rest suggested that abstract reasoning is also a factor in making moral judgements&lt;ref name=RestJudging/&gt; and emphasized that moral judgements alone do not predict moral behaviour: “Moral judgement may be closely related to advocacy behaviour, which in turn influences social institutions, which in turn creates a system of norms and sanctions that influences people’s behaviour.”&lt;ref name=RestJudging&gt;James R. Rest, Development in Judging Moral Issues. (1979). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Daleiden suggested that religions instill a practical sense of virtue and justice, right and wrong. They also effectively use art and myths to educate people about moral situations.&lt;ref&gt;323, 326, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of government====
Harris argues that moral science does not imply an "[[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian future" with "scientists at every door". Instead, Harris imagines data about normative moral issues being shared in the same way as other sciences (e.g. peer-reviewed journals on medicine).&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ www.salon.com] Asked "Let's say scientists do end up discovering moral truths. How are they supposed to enforce their findings? Would they become something like policemen or priests?" Harris writes ''"They wouldn’t necessarily enforce them any more than they enforce their knowledge about human health. What are scientists doing with the knowledge that smoking causes cancer or obesity is bad for your health, or that the common cold is spread by not washing your hands? We’re not living in some Orwellian world where we have scientists in lab coats at every door. Imagine we discovered that there is a best way to teach your children to be compassionate, or to defer short-term gratification in the service of a long-term goal. What if it turns out to be true that calcium intake in the first two years of life has a significant effect on a child’s emotional life? If we learn that, what parent wouldn’t want that knowledge? The fear of a "Brave New World" component to this argument is unfounded."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Daleiden specifies that government, like any organization, should have limited power. He says "centralization of power irrevocably in the hands of one person or an elite has always ultimately led to great evil for the human race. It was the novel experiment of democracy—a clear break with tradition—that ended the long tradition of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;219, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also explicit that [[government]] should only use law to enforce the most basic, reasonable, evidence and widely supported moral norms. In other words, there are a great many moral norms that should never be the task of the government to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;273–274, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of punishment====
{{Main|Differential reinforcement|Prison}}
One author has argued that to attain a society where people are motivated by conditioned self-interest, [[punishment]] must go hand-in-hand with [[reward system|reward]].&lt;ref&gt;77, Daleiden (1998), quote “We use rewards and punishments, praise and blame, in training any animal. The human species is only different in degree in this regard, not in kind.”&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in this line of reasoning, prison remains necessary for many perpetrators of crimes. This is so, even if libertarian free will is false. This is because punishment can still serve its purposes: it deters others from committing their own crimes, educates and reminds everyone about what the society stands for, incapacitates the criminal from doing more harm, goes some way to relieving or repaying the victim, and corrects the criminal (also see [[recidivism]]). This author argues that, at least, any prison system ''should'' be pursuing those goals, and that it is an empirical question as to what sorts of punishment realize these goals most effectively, and how well various [[prison]] systems actually serve these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;289, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
{{see also| Positive psychology|Moral development}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ "Bzdok, D. et al. Parsing the neural correlates of moral cognition: ALE meta-analysis on morality, theory of mind, and empathy. Brain Struct Funct, 2011."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons’ points of view and to grasping others’ feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.
An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R. Nathan |title=Salience network engagement with the detection of morally laden information |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=July 2017 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1118–1127 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsx035|pmid=28338944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeley |first1=W. W. |last2=Menon |first2=V. |last3=Schatzberg |first3=A. F. |last4=Keller |first4=J. |last5=Glover |first5=G. H. |last6=Kenna |first6=H. |last7=Reiss |first7=A. L. |last8=Greicius |first8=M. D. |title=Dissociable Intrinsic Connectivity Networks for Salience Processing and Executive Control |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |date=28 February 2007 |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2349–2356 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5587-06.2007|pmc=2680293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menon |first1=Vinod |last2=Uddin |first2=Lucina Q. |title=Saliency, switching, attention and control: a network model of insula function |journal=Brain Structure and Function |date=29 May 2010 |volume=214 |issue=5–6 |pages=655–667 |doi=10.1007/s00429-010-0262-0|pmc=2899886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes. This suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain networks and their interactions.

===Other implications===

Daleiden provides examples of how science can use empirical evidence to assess the effect that specific behaviors can have on the well-being of individuals and society with regard to various moral issues. He argues that science supports [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization and regulation of drugs]], euthanasia under some circumstances, and the permission of sexual behaviors that are not tolerated in some cultures (he cites [[homosexuality]] as an example). Daleiden further argues that in seeking to reduce human suffering, [[abortion]] should not only be permissible, but at times a moral obligation (as in the case of a mother of a potential child who would face the probability of much suffering). Like all moral claims in his book, however, Daleiden is adamant that these decisions remain grounded in, and contingent on empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Joseph Daleiden's final word regarding his book, ''The Science of Morality,'' is that “[The study of ethics] should be included with the social sciences and be subject to as rigorous a scientific program of research as any other area of human behaviour. Lacking this scientific rigour, the moral conclusions drawn in this volume must be considered as working hypotheses, some with greater degree of evidentiary support than others. It is the process by which to assess and transmit moral norms that was the primary focus of this work, and I hope it will serve as a new way of deciding moral issues.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of [[cultural relativity]], to Daleiden, do offer some lessons: investigators must be careful not to judge a person's behaviour without understanding the environmental context. An action may be necessary and more moral once we are aware of circumstances.&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"&gt;100, Daleiden&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daleiden emphasizes that this does not mean all ethical norms or systems are equally effective at promoting flourishing&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"/&gt; and he often offers the equal treatment of women as a reliably superior norm, wherever it is practiced.

== Criticisms ==

The idea of a normative science of morality has met with some criticisms. Critics include physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]], who argues that morality cannot be part of science.&lt;ref name=twsJun14eef&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= Casting morality as a maximization problem might seem overly restrictive at first glance, but the procedure can potentially account for a wide variety of approaches. A libertarian might want to maximize a feeling of personal freedom, while a traditional utilitarian might want to maximize some version of happiness. The point is simply that the goal of morality should be to create certain conditions that are, in principle, directly measurable by empirical means. ...Nevertheless, I want to argue that this program is simply not possible. ...

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and other critics cite the widely held "[[fact-value distinction]]", that the [[scientific method]] cannot answer "moral" questions, although it can describe the norms of different cultures. In contrast, moral scientists defend the position that such a division between values and scientific facts ("moral relativism") is not only arbitrary and illusory, but impeding progress towards taking action against documented cases of human rights violations in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Moralconfusion&gt;{{cite news

Fanciers of Hume’s is/ought distinction never seem to realize what the stakes are, and they do not see what an abject failure of compassion their intellectual “tolerance” of moral difference amounts to.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that science and religion occupy "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]". To Gould, science is concerned with questions of fact and theory, but not with meaning and morality – the magisteria of religion. In the same vein, [[Edward Teller]] proposed that politics decides what is right, whereas science decides what is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5367/1200 Essays on Science and Society. "Science and Morality".]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a discussion on the role that [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] might play in professions like [[nursing]], Philosopher Trevor Hussey calls the popular view that science is unconcerned with morality "too simplistic". Although his main focus in the paper is naturalism in nursing, he goes on to explain that science can, at very least, be interested in morality at a descriptive level. He even briefly entertains the idea that morality could itself be a scientific subject, writing that one ''might'' argue "..that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one. If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here."
{{#tag:ref|Hussey writes "The relationship between naturalism and morality and politics is complicated, and is difficult to state in a few sentences because it involves deep philosophical issues. Only the briefest discussion is possible here. The most popular view is that science, and hence naturalism, is concerned with objective facts and not with values: with what is the case rather than what ought to be. But this is too simplistic." He gives a reason immediately: "First, at the very least, science can study morality and politics at a descriptive level and try to understand their workings within societies and in the lives of individuals, and investigate their evolutionary origins, their social propagation, and so on." Hussey then describes how scientists must adhere to certain values, but also how values guide what it is that science may investigate. His real interest in the paper is to justify naturalism as a nursing practice, yet he does eventually write: "Finally, the idea that science and morality are separate realms, one dealing with facts the other with values, is not as certain and clear-cut as it seems. Various versions of moral realism are now widely discussed among philosophers (e.g. Railton, 1986, 1996, 2003; Sayre-McCord, 1988; Dancy, 1993; Casebeer, 2003; Shafer-Landau, 2003; Baghramian, 2004; Smith, 1994, 2004). Despite their differences, moral realists generally agree on two principles. First, that our moral utterances, such as ‘Murder is morally wrong’ or ‘We ought to be honest’ are genuine statements and hence they are capable of being either true or false. Second, what makes them either true or false are aspects of the real world, open to objective examination. It can be argued that it is an implication of this thesis that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one." He continues "If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here. It is sufficient to say that it has at least as much credibility as any theory claiming a supernatural or divine foundation for morality: views which, while popular among the general public, do not have widespread support among moral philosophers – for what that is worth." Hussey thus directs discussion back towards Naturalism in nursing because his main point in all this was, in the end, to prove that naturalistic moralities are not necessarily less credible than supernatural ones, and may even be more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Naturalistic nursing, Trevor Hussey (2011), Nursing Philosophy, Vol 12, Pg.45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite web | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite web | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = | year = | pages = | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

===Sociobiology and kinship===

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;. To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[national academy of science]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, |url=https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, DOI: 10.1177/0308275X15594535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published debate and criticism of the book==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=September 2014}}

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''stare-in-the-crowd effect''' is the notion that an eyes-forward, direct [[Gaze |  gaze]] is more easily detected than an averted gaze.  First discovered by [[psychologist]] and [[neurophysiologist]] [[Michael von Grünau]] (October 3, 1944-December 22, 2011) and his psychology student [[Christina Marie Anston]] using human subjects (von Grünau and Anston 1995), the processing advantage associated with this effect is thought to derive from the importance of [[Eye contact | eye contact]] as a cue for social interactions.

In their seminal 1995 paper published in [[ Perception (journal) | Perception]], von Grünau and Anston demonstrated that staring eyes (straight gaze with iris and pupil in center position in eye socket) are detected faster than eyes gazing to the right or left (averted gaze with iris and pupil in right-most or left-most position in eye socket).  Eye targets with a straight gaze when presented in an array of averted gaze nontargets are detected faster with fewer errors than an averted gaze targets presented in an array of straight gaze targets.  This search asymmetry in which straight gaze targets are given preference in array of averted gaze distractors is found for both realistically drawn and schematic eye stimuli but not for other arrayed objects.  Search asymmetry is not seen with geometric stimuli, for instance 1 x 3 rows of black and white squares, that vary in the position of the distinguishing feature or stimuli consisting of only one schematic eye.

This effect, which has subsequently been replicated in many different search paradigms, is understood in terms of the evolutionary significance of what is considered to be one of the most critical [[Socio-cognitive | sociocognitive]] abilities of humans and other primates: gaze perception.  Gaze perception can manifest itself in two ways depending on context, social group or species.  Mutual gaze or eye contact in humans and some other primates in one context can serve to bond individuals and regulate social interactions, through the transmission of expressions of intimacy and filial identity (Kleinke 1986).  But, in another context, a sustained stare may be interpreted as a sign of hostility or anger – a cue for increased vigilance or aversive action (Ellsworth and Carlsmith 1973).  Staring is a threat gesture in many primate societies (Hinde and Rowell 1962) and makes most people feel nervous and tense (Strom and Beck 1979).  Be that as it may, regardless of how it is perceived and subsequently processed cognitively a directed gaze is a powerful cue, an amber alert, for potential synergistic or antagonistic interactions.
 
According to Darwin (1872) and Gibson (1969), organisms have evolved perceptual sensitivities that maximize their survival.  Among these is a visual system that rapidly and reliably identifies and discriminates relevant from irrelevant cues.  The stare-in-the-crowd effect is considered to be one of these perceptual abilities: a ‘quick and dirty’ primary process, by means of which an organism can take on board basic facts about the space it shares with others and respond appropriately to maximize its survival and/or the survival of conspecifics with a common filial identity.

It has been speculated that [[Human eye | human eye]] morphology evolved from a necessity for fast and accurate gaze perception for complex social interactions (Emery 2000).  According to this model, an eye direction detector (EDD) mechanism - a neurocognitive system responsible for the rapid detection of eyes in the environment and their gaze direction – arose as a function of the geometry created by a dark circular iris relative to the white sclera (Baron-Cohen 1994).  Specifically, it is contended that the increased ratio of exposed sclera in the eye outline of humans serves to enhance the velocity and acuity of gaze direction perception (Kobayashi and Kohshima 2001).

{{For|other uses of the word "charm"|Charm (disambiguation)}}

'''Superficial charm''' (or '''insincere charm''' or '''glib charm''') is the tendency to be smooth, engaging, charming, slick and verbally facile.&lt;ref&gt;Hare's checklist, as cited in {{cite book |title=Psychopathy: antisocial, criminal, and violent behavior |authorlink=Theodore Millon |first=Theodore |last=Millon |first2=Erik |last2=Simonsen |first3=Morten |last3=Birket-Smith |first4=Roger D. |last4=Davis |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2002 |page=173 |isbn=1-57230-344-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase often appears in lists of attributes of [[psychopath]]ic personalities, such as in [[Hervey M. Cleckley]]'s ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last=Cleckley | first=Hervey | accessdate= 14 November 2009 | url= http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/sanity_1.PdF
| title = The Mask of Sanity | publisher = Emily S. Cleckley
| edition= 5th | year=1988 | isbn= 0-9621519-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert D. Hare]]'s [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, Robert D. (1991). "The Hare Psychopathy Checklist" (Revised). (North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems)&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated expressions are "[[#Charm offensive|charm offensive]]", "turning on the charm" and "[[Superficiality|superficial]] [[smile]]".

== Early history ==
[[Classical rhetoric]] had early singled out the critical category of the superficial charmer, whose merit was purely verbal, without underlying substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. L. |last=Clarke |first2=D. H. |last2=Berry |title=Rhetoric at Rome: A Historical Survey |year=1996 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=146 |isbn=0-415-14155-9 |edition=Rev. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychopathic charm ==
Contemporary interest in superficial charm goes back to [[Hervey M. Cleckley]]'s classic study (1941) of the sociopath: since his work it has become widely accepted that the sociopath/psychopath was characterised by superficial charm and a disregard for other people's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bella |last=DePaulo |first2=Leah |last2=Wilson |title=The Psychology of Dexter |location=Dallas |publisher=Smart Pop |year=2010 |page=7 |isbn=978-1-935251-97-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hare, "Psychopathic charm is not in the least shy, self-conscious, or afraid to say anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/narcissism/psychopathy_checklist.html |title=Antisocial Personality, Sociopathy, and Psychopathy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818085421/http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/narcissism/psychopathy_checklist.html |archivedate=2010-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent studies have refined, but not perhaps fundamentally altered, Cleckley's initial assessment. In the latest diagnostic review, Cleckley's mix of intelligence and superficial charm has been redefined to reflect a more deviant demeanour, talkative, slick, and insincere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. F. |last=Salekin |first2=D. R. |last2=Lynam |title=Handbook of Child and Adolescent Psychopathology |year=2010 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |page=22 |isbn=978-1-60623-682-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can also be drawn between a subtle, self-effacing kind of sociopathic charm,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ronson, ''[[The Psychopath Test]]'' (2011) p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more expansive, exhilarating spontaneity which serves to give the sociopath a sort of animal magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Stout, ''The Sociopath Next Door'' (2005) pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}

The authors of the book [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase one (entry), the psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and charm to obtain employment by an organisation.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate psychopaths within organizations may be singled out for rapid promotion because of their polish, charm, and cool decisiveness.&lt;ref name=Financial&gt;Boddy, C. R The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global Financial Crisis Journal of Business Ethics August 2011, Volume 102, Issue 2, pp 255-259&lt;/ref&gt; Their superficial charm may be misinterpreted as charisma.&lt;ref name=Snakes/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;https://leb.fbi.gov/2012/november/the-corporate-psychopath
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissism ==
{{Main|Narcissism}}

The term also occurs in Hotchkiss' discussion of narcissists: "Their superficial charm can be enchanting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hotchkiss |first=Sandy |authorlink2=James F. Masterson |last2=Masterson |first2=James F. |title=Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-7432-1428-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For such figures, however, there is no substance behind the romantic gestures, which only serve to feed the narcissist's own ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Crompton |title=All about Me: Loving a Narcissist |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=2007 |pages=68–69 |isbn=978-0-00-724795-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Narcissists are known as [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in a charming way, entrapping their victims through a [[façade]] of understanding into suspending their self-protective behaviour and lowering their [[personal boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Abdennur |title=Camouflaged Aggression: The Hidden Threat to Individuals and Organizations |year=2000 |pages=87 and 156 |location=Calgary |publisher=Detselig |isbn=1-55059-198-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related is the way [[impostor]]s are able to make people fall in love with them to satisfy their narcissistic needs, without reciprocating in any real sense or returning their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Otto Fenichel |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |year=1946 |page=374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social chameleons ==

Social [[chameleons]] have been described as adept in [[social intelligence]], able to make a charming good impression, yet at the price of their own true motivations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Goleman]], ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to manage impressions well often leads to success in areas like the theatre, salesmanship, or politics and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; But when lacking a sense of their own inner needs, such superficial [[extravert]]s may end up (despite their charm) as rootless chameleons, endlessly taking their social cues from other people.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, for the [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic personality]], the [[attention seeking]] through superficial charm may only reinforce the [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of the [[True self and false self|real self]] from the public presentation in a vicious circle.&lt;ref&gt;Len Sperry, ''Handbook of diagnosis and treatment of DSM-IV-TR personality disorder'' (2003) p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive outcomes ==

Superficial charmers, in their more benign manifestations, can produce a variety of positive results, their conversational skills providing light-hearted entertainment in social settings through their ability to please.&lt;ref&gt;Salekin, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charm offensive ==
{{See also|Public relations|Spin (public relations)}}

A "charm offensive" is a related concept meaning a publicity campaign, usually by politicians, that attempts to attract supporters by emphasizing their charisma or [[trustworthiness]]. The first recorded use of the expression is in the California newspaper ''[[The Fresno Bee Republican]]'' in October 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin, Gary |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/89950.html |title=Charm offensive |work=The Phrase Finder|date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary analogues ==
[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] explored the destructive consequences of excess charm in stories like "Magnetism", maintaining that charm, for those who had it, had a life of its own, demanding constant use to keep it in peak condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], ''Bernice Bobs Her Hair and other stories'' (Penguin 1968) p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics object that there are few objective criteria whereby to distinguish superficial from genuine charm; and that as part of the conventional niceties of politeness, we all regularly employ superficial charm in everyday life:&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Pfohl, ''Images of Deviance and Social Control'' (1985) p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; conveying superficial solidarity and fictitious benevolence to all social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Stuff of Thought'' (2007) pp. 480–481.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prop''', formally known as '''(theatrical) property''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/property Oxford Dictionaries Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817070616/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/property |date=2016-08-17 }} "old-fashioned term for prop"&lt;/ref&gt; is an object used on stage or on screen by [[actors]] during a [[performance]] or [[Filmmaking#Production|screen production]]. In practical terms, a prop is considered to be anything movable or portable on a stage or a set, distinct from the actors, scenery, costumes, and electrical equipment. Consumable food items appearing in the production are also considered props.&lt;ref name="Nesfield-Cookson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nesfield-Cookson |first=Mary |title=Small Stage Properties and Furniture |year=1934 |publisher=G.

==Term==
The earliest known use of the term "properties" in English to refer to stage accessories is in the 1425 CE [[morality play]], ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.props.eric-hart.com/education/first-use-of-property-in-the-theatrical-sense/ |title = First use of "Property" in the theatrical sense |last = Hart |first = Eric |date = 19 October 2009 |work = Prop Agenda |accessdate = 7 April 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041525/http://www.props.eric-hart.com/education/first-use-of-property-in-the-theatrical-sense/ |archivedate = 22 February 2014 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stage Properties |first=Dutton |last=Cook |magazine=Belgravia |volume=35 |pages=282–284 |year=1878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds the first usage of "props" in 1841, while the singular form of "prop" appeared in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;prop, n./6; Third edition, September 2009; online version November 2010. &lt;http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/152851&gt;; accessed 13 January 2011. An entry for this word was first included in New English Dictionary, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Renaissance]] in [[Europe]], small acting troupes functioned as cooperatives, pooling resources and dividing any income. Many performers provided their own costumes, but special items—stage weapons, furniture or other hand-held devices—were considered "company property"; hence the term "property."&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;[[Eric Partridge]] ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English: Second Edition''. Random House 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macgowan"&gt;Kenneth Macgowan and William Melnitz ''The Living Stage''. Prentice-Hall 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts however seem to think that the term comes from the idea that stage or screen objects "belong" to whoever uses them on stage.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

There is no difference between props in different media, such as theatre, film, or television. Bland Wade, a properties director, says, "A coffee cup onstage is a coffee cup on television, is a coffee cup on the big screen." He adds, "There are definitely different responsibilities and different vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Through the Eyes of the Property Director |first=Blande |last=Wade |journal=Theatre Symposium |volume=18 |page=8 |year=2010 |issn=1065-4917 |isbn=978-0-8173-7005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On stage and backstage==
[[Image:Fundus Nationaltheater Mannheim.jpg|thumb|right|Props storage room of the National Theatre, Germany]]
The term "theatrical property" originated to describe an object used in a stage play and similar entertainments to further the action. Technically, a prop is any object that gives the scenery, actors, or performance space specific period, place, or character.{{inconsistent}} The term comes from live-performance practice, especially theatrical methods, but its modern use extends beyond the traditional plays and musical, circus, novelty, comedy, and even public-speaking performances, to film, television, and electronic media.

Props in a production originate from off stage unless they have been preset on the stage before the production begins. Props are stored on a prop table backstage near the actor's entrance during production then generally locked in a storage area between performances. The person in charge of handling the props is generally called the "props master". Other positions also include coordinators, production assistants and interns as may be needed for a specific project.

==Modern usage==
The term has readily transferred to [[television]], [[motion picture]] and [[video game]] production, where they are commonly referred to by the phrase '''movie prop''', '''film prop''' or simply '''prop'''. In recent years, the increasing popularity of [[movie memorabilia]] (a broader term that also includes costumes) has added new meaning to the term "prop", broadening its existence to include a valuable after-life as a prized collector's item. Typically not available until after a film's premiere, movie props appearing on-screen are called "screen-used", and can fetch thousands of dollars in online auctions and charity benefits.&lt;ref name="Mohr"&gt;Ian Mohr ''[[Daily Variety]]''. Reed Business Information, February 27, 2006 [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117938954.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 "Movie props on the block: Mouse to auction Miramax leftovers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021080710/http://variety.com/article/VR1117938954.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;David James, ''[[People Magazine]]'', Time, Inc. February 24, 2007 [http://offtherack.people.com/2007/02/dress_like_a_dr.html#comment-66215834 "Bid on Dreamgirls Costumes for Charity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226152128/http://offtherack.people.com/2007/02/dress_like_a_dr.html |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many props are ordinary objects. However, a prop must "read well" from the [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of theatre terms#H|house]] or on-screen, meaning it must look real to the audience. Many real objects are poorly adapted to the task of looking like themselves to an audience, due to their size, durability, or color under bright lights, so some props are specially designed to look more like the actual item than the real object would look. In some cases, a prop is designed to behave differently from how the real object would, often for the sake of safety.

Examples of special props are:
* A prop sack representing a [[burlap bag]], might have another black fabric bag sewn, discreetly inside the burlap, giving it strength, hiding the contents and creating a visual void to the audience view.
* A prop mop, representing a string [[mop]], but built out of a rectangular shape covered with fabric, so the mop can be slid across the stage to another actress as part of a musical number (as in ''Fiddler on the Roof''{{'}}s song "Matchmaker").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.trinity.edu/sgilliam/SLG/FIDDLER/TROIKA//PROPS/STOCK/HOUSEINTERIOR/homepage.html|title=HOUSE INTERIOR PROPS|author=|date=|website=faculty.trinity.edu|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430152902/http://faculty.trinity.edu/sgilliam/SLG/FIDDLER/TROIKA//PROPS/STOCK/HOUSEINTERIOR/homepage.html|archivedate=30 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[prop weapon]] (such as a stage gun or a stage sword) that looks functional, but lacks the intentional harmfulness of the corresponding real weapon. In the theater, prop weapons are almost always either non-operable replicas, or have safety features to ensure they are not dangerous. Guns fire caps or noisy blanks, swords are dulled, and knives are often made of plastic or rubber. In film production, fully functional weapons are mostly used, but typically only with special [[smoke blank]]s with blank adapted guns instead of real bullets. Real cartridges with bullets removed are still dangerously charged which has caused several tragic instances when used on stage or film. The safety and proper handling of real weapons used as movie props is the premiere responsibility of the ''[[prop master]]''. [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] and other law enforcement agencies may monitor the use of real guns for film and television, but this is generally not necessary with stage props as these guns are permanently "plugged".
* Breakaway objects, or ''stunt props,'' such as [[balsa]]-wood furniture, or [[sugar glass]] (mock-glassware made of crystallized sugar) whose breakage and debris look real but rarely cause injury due to their light weight and weak structure. Even for such seemingly safe props, very often a [[stunt double]] will replace the main actor for shots involving use of breakaway props. Rubber bladed-weapons and guns are examples of props used by [[Stunt performer|stuntmen]] to minimize injury, or by actors where the action requires a prop which minimizes injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyle |first=Richard |title=A Collector's Guide To Hand Props |url=http://www.racprops.com/issue3/editorial/ |work= |publisher=RACprops |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195326/http://racprops.com/issue3/editorial/ |archivedate=3 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Hero" props are the more detailed pieces intended for close inspection by the camera or audience. The hero prop may have legible writing, lights, moving parts, or other attributes or functions missing from a standard prop; a hero prop [[Weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, for example, might include a depressible trigger and a light-up muzzle and display panel (all of which would make the hero prop more expensive and less durable). The term is also used on occasion for ''any'' of the items that a main character would carry in film and television (which are often hero props in the first sense as well). The term may sometimes be used in stage production, as many props from film find their way into theatre from common rental and purchase shops.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25272">In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]], '''type theory''' is a branch of [[computational logic]] that studies types, which informally, are attributes that objects can possess. In type theory, each object is a "term" of a definite type and operations on objects are restricted to those which are definitely terms of the relevant types. As a [[formal system]], some type theories contend to be simultaneously an alternative [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]] to [[set theory]], a [[programming language]] and a calculus for [[category theory]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+theory&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Type theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) [[type system]]s, which are a [[programming language]] feature used to reduce [[bug (computer programming)|bug]]s. Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal [[mathematical logic|logic]]s and [[rewrite system]]s.

Two well-known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[typed lambda calculus|typed λ-calculus]] and [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]].

==History==
{{Main|History of type theory}}
Between 1902 and 1908 [[Bertrand Russell]] proposed various "theories of type" in response to his discovery that [[Gottlob Frege]]'s version of [[naive set theory]] was afflicted with [[Russell's paradox]]. By 1908 Russell arrived at a "ramified" theory of types together with an "[[axiom of reducibility]]" both of which featured prominently in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' published between 1910 and 1913. They attempted to resolve Russell's paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types, then assigning each concrete mathematical (and possibly other) entity to a type. Entities of a given type are built exclusively from entities of those types that are lower in their hierarchy, thus preventing an entity from being assigned to itself. In the 1920s, [[Leon Chwistek]] and [[Frank P. Ramsey]] proposed an unramified type theory, now known as the "theory of simple types" or "simple type theory", that collapsed the hierarchy of the types in the earlier ramified theory and as such did not require the axiom of reducibility.

The common usage of "type theory" is when those types are used with a [[term rewrite system]]. The most famous early example is [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. Church's theory of types&lt;ref name="church"&gt;[[Alonzo Church]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2266170 ''A formulation of the simple theory of types''], The Journal of Symbolic Logic 5(2):56&amp;ndash;68 (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; helped the formal system avoid the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]] that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a [[higher-order logic]].

Some other type theories include [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]], which has been the foundation used in some areas of [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]] and for the proof assistant [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]]. [[Thierry Coquand]]'s [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives are the foundation used by [[Coq]] and others. The field is an area of active research, as demonstrated by [[homotopy type theory]].

==Basic concepts==
In a system of type theory, each '''[[term (logic)|term]]''' has a '''type'''.  For example, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; are all separate terms with the type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt; for natural numbers.  Traditionally, the term is followed by a colon and its type, such as &lt;math&gt;2 : \mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.

Type theories have explicit computation and it is encoded in rules for rewriting terms. These are called '''conversion rules''' or, if the rule only works in one direction, a '''reduction rule'''. For example, &lt;math&gt;2 + 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; are syntactically different terms, but the former reduces to the latter. This reduction is written &lt;math&gt;2 + 2 \twoheadrightarrow 4&lt;/math&gt;.

Functions in type theory have a special reduction rule: the argument of the function call gets substituted for every occurrence of the parameter in the function definition.  Let's say the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x . x+x &lt;/math&gt; (using Church's lambda notation) or &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x+x &lt;/math&gt; (using a more modern notation).  Then, the function call &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2&lt;/math&gt; would be reduced by substituting &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; for every copy of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the body of the function definition.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2 \twoheadrightarrow 2+2&lt;/math&gt;.

The type of a function is denoted with an arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; from the parameter type to the function's resulting type. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double} : \mathrm{nat} \to \mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.   Calling or "[[apply]]ing" a function to an argument may be written with or without parentheses, so &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}(2)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;. Not using parentheses is more common, because multiple argument functions can be defined using [[currying]].

==Difference from set theory==
There are many different set theories and many different systems of type theory, so what follows are generalizations.
* Set theory is built on top of logic. It requires a separate system like [[predicate logic]] underneath it. In type theory, concepts like "and" and "or" can be encoded as types in the type theory itself.
* In set theory, an element can belong to multiple sets, either to a subset or to a superset. In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type. (Where a subset would be used, type theory tends to use a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate function]] that returns true if the term is in the subset and returns false if the value is not.  The union of two types can be done by creating a new type called a [[Tagged union|sum type]], which contains new terms.)
* Set theory usually encodes numbers as sets.  (0 is the empty set, 1 is a set containing the empty set, etc.  See [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]].) Type theory can encode numbers as functions using [[Church encoding]] or more naturally as [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]].  Inductive types create new constants for the [[Successor function|successor function]] and zero, and closely resembles [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]].
* Set theory allows [[Set-builder notation|set builder notation]].
* Type theory has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the [[BHK interpretation]].  It can be connected to logic by the [[Curry Howard isomorphism]].  And some type theories are closely connected to [[Category theory]].

==Optional features==
===Normalization===
The term &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; cannot be reduced further, it is called a '''normal form'''. A system of type theory is said to be '''[[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strongly normalizing]]''' if all terms have a normal form and any order of reductions reaches it. '''Weakly normalizing''' systems have a normal form but some orders of reductions may loop forever and never reach it.

For a normalizing system, some borrow the word '''element''' from set theory and use it to refer to all closed terms that can reduce to the same normal form. A '''closed term''' is one without parameters. (A term like &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; with its parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''open term'''.) Thus, &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3 + 0&lt;/math&gt; may be different terms but they are both from the element &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.

A similar idea that works for open and closed terms is convertibility. Two terms are '''convertible''' if there exists a term that they both reduce to. For example, &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; are convertible. As are &lt;math&gt;x + (1 + 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + 2&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 + x&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a free variable) are not because both are in normal form and they are not the same. [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|Confluent]] and weakly normalizing systems can test if two terms are convertible by checking if they both reduce to the same normal form.

===Dependent types===
{{Main|Dependent types}}
A '''dependent type''' is a type that depends on a term or on another type. Thus, the type returned by a function may depend upon the argument to the function.

For example, a list of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;s of length 4 may be a different type than a list of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;s of length 5. In a type theory with dependent types, it is possible to define a function that takes a parameter "n" and returns a list containing "n" zeros. Calling the function with 4 would produce a term with a different type than if the function was called with 5.

Dependent types play a central role in [[intuitionistic type theory]] and in the design of [[functional programming languages]] like [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]].

{{anchor|Equality types}}

===Equality types===

Many systems of type theory have a type that represents equality of types and of terms. This type is different from convertibility, and is often denoted '''propositional equality'''.

In intuitionistic type theory, the equality type (also called the identity type) is known as &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; for identity. There is a type &lt;math&gt;I\ A\ a\ b&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a type and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are both terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. A term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ A\ a\ b&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as meaning that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

In practice, it is possible to build a type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 4&lt;/math&gt; but there will not exist a term of that type. In intuitionistic type theory, new terms of equality start with reflexivity. If &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 3&lt;/math&gt;. More complicated equalities can be created by creating a reflexive term and then doing a reduction on one side. So if &lt;math&gt;2+1&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ (2+1)\ (2+1)&lt;/math&gt; and, by reduction, generate a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ (2+1)\ 3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in this system, the equality type denotes that two values of the same type are convertible by reductions.

Having a type for equality is important because it can be manipulated inside the system. There is usually no judgement to say two terms are ''not'' equal; instead, as in the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], we map &lt;math&gt;\neg(a = b)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(a = b) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bottom type]] having no values. There exists a term with type {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;(I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 4) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;,}} but not one of type &lt;math&gt;(I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 3) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Homotopy type theory]] differs from [[intuitionistic type theory]] mostly by its handling of the equality type.

===Inductive types===
{{main|Inductive type}}
A system of type theory requires some basic terms and types to operate on. Some systems build them out of functions using [[Church encoding]]. Other systems have '''inductive types''': a set of base types and a set of [[type constructor]]s that generate types with well-behaved properties. For example, [[Structural induction|certain recursive functions]] called on inductive types are guaranteed to terminate.

'''Coinductive type''' are infinite data types created by giving a function that generates the next element(s). See [[Coinduction]] and [[Corecursion]].

'''[[Induction-induction]] ''' is a feature for declaring an inductive type and a family of types that depends on the inductive type.

'''[[Induction-recursion (type theory)|Induction recursion]]''' allows a wider range of well-behaved types, allowing the type and recursive functions operating on it to be defined at the same time.

===Universe types===
Types were created to prevent paradoxes, such as [[Russell's paradox]]. However, the motives that lead to those paradoxes—being able to say things about all types—still exist. So, many type theories have a "universe type", which contains all ''other'' types (and not itself).

In systems where you might want to say something about universe types, there is a hierarchy of universe types, each containing the one below it in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined as being infinite, but statements must only refer to a finite number of universe levels.

Type universes are particularly tricky in type theory. The initial proposal of intuitionistic type theory suffered from [[Girard's paradox]].

===Computational component===
Many systems of type theory, such as the [[simply-typed lambda calculus]], [[intuitionistic type theory]], and the [[calculus of constructions]], are also programming languages. That is, they are said to have a "computational component". The computation is the reduction of terms of the language using [[rewriting|rewriting rules]].

A system of type theory that has a well-behaved computational component also has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the [[BHK interpretation]].

Non-constructive mathematics in these systems is possible by adding operators on continuations such as [[Call/cc#Relation to non-constructive logic|call with current continuation]]. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as [[canonicity (type theory)|canonicity]] and [[parametricity]].

==Type theories==
===Major===
* [[Simply typed lambda calculus]] which is a [[higher-order logic]];
* [[intuitionistic type theory]];
* [[system F]];
* [[Logical framework|LF]] is often used to define other type theories;
* [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives.

===Minor===
* [[Automath]];
* [[ST type theory]];
* some forms of [[combinatory logic]];
* others defined in the [[lambda cube]];
* others under the name [[typed lambda calculus]];
* others under the name [[pure type system]].

===Active===
* [[Homotopy type theory]] is being researched.

==Practical impact==
===Programming languages===
{{Main|Type system}}
There is extensive overlap and interaction between the fields of type theory and type systems. Type systems are a programming language feature designed to identify bugs. Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of [[compiler]], has a connection to type theory.

A prime example is [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]], a programming language which uses [[intuitionistic type theory]] for its type system. The programming language [[ML (programming language)|ML]] was developed for manipulating type theories (see [[Logic for Computable Functions|LCF]]) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.

===Mathematical foundations===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The first computer proof assistant, called [[Automath]], used type theory to encode mathematics on a computer. Martin-Löf specifically developed [[intuitionistic type theory]] to encode ''all'' mathematics to serve as a new foundation for mathematics. There is current research into mathematical foundations using [[homotopy type theory]].

Mathematicians working in [[category theory]] already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]. This led to proposals such as Lawvere's [[Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets]] (ETCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=ETCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and [[algebraic topology]] (specifically [[homotopy]]).

===Proof assistants===
{{main|Proof assistant}}
Much of the current research into type theory is driven by [[Automated proof checking|proof checkers]], interactive [[proof assistant]]s, and [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]]. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:
* [[Logical framework|LF]] is used by [[Twelf]], often to define other type theories;
* multiple type theories falling under [[higher-order logic]] are used by the [[HOL (proof assistant)|HOL family of provers]] and [[Prototype Verification System|PVS]];
* [[intuitionistic type theory]] is used by [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]] which is both a programming language and proof assistant;
* computational type theory is used by [[NuPRL]];
* [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives are used by [[Coq]] and [[Matita]].

Multiple type theories are supported by [[LEGO (proof assistant)|LEGO]] and [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]]. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. [[Mizar system|Mizar]] is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.

===Linguistics===
Type theory is also widely in use in [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal theories of semantics]] of [[natural language]]s, especially [[Montague grammar]] and its descendants. In particular, [[categorial grammar]]s and [[pregroup grammar]]s make extensive use of type constructors to define the types (''noun'', ''verb'', etc.) of words.

The most common construction takes the basic types &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for individuals and [[truth-value]]s, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:
* if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are types, then so is &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;;
* nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.

A complex type &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the type of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from entities of type &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to entities of type &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus one has types like &lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. [[indicator function]]s of sets of entities. An expression of type &lt;math&gt;\langle\langle e,t\rangle,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of [[Generalized quantifier|natural language quantifiers]], like '' everybody'' or '' nobody'' ([[Richard Montague|Montague]] 1973, [[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] and Cooper 1981).

===Social sciences===
[[Gregory Bateson]] introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of [[double bind]] and [[logical levels]] are based on Russell's theory of types.

==Relation to category theory==
Although the initial motivation for [[category theory]] was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As [[John Lane Bell]] writes: "In fact categories can ''themselves'' be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory." In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or sorts), i.e. "Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax." A number of significant results follow in this way:&lt;ref name="Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of the History of Logic. Volume 6. Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-093066-4| author=John L. Bell|chapter=Types, Sets and Categories | url = http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/types.pdf |editor=Akihiro Kanamory}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]] correspond to the typed λ-calculus ([[Lambek]], 1970);
* [[C-monoid]]s (categories with products and exponentials and a single, nonterminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and [[Dana Scott]] around 1980);
* [[Locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed categories]] correspond to [[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf type theories]] (Seely, 1984).

The interplay, known as [[categorical logic]], has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.

A '''wedding invitation''' is a letter asking the recipient to attend a [[wedding]]. It is typically written in formal, [[grammatical|third-person]] language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.

Like any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host—historically, for younger brides in [[Western culture]], the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family—to issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social [[secretary]] to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service.  With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a [[mail merge]] with [[word processing]] and [[spreadsheet]] software.

==History==

===The Middle Ages and before===
Prior to the invention of the moveable-type [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a [[Town crier]]: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.

In the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of [[Calligraphy]], to hand-craft their notices.

Such documents often carried the [[Coat of arms]], or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.

===From 1600 onward===
Despite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time.

In 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or [[Mezzotint]]) by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Antony (ed), ''Landmarks in Print Collecting - Connoisseurs and Donors at the British Museum since 1753'', p. 138, 1996, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|0714126098}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engraving]], as the name implies, requires an artisan to "hand write" the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day.

At the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation.

===The Industrial Revolution===
Following the invention of [[Lithography]] by [[Alois Senefelder]] in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lithography and Lithographers|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher|place=London|year=1915|editor=Pennel ER|url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations.

Wedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A ‘double envelope’ was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability.

===Modern times===
The origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the life-styles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as [[Amy Vanderbilt]] and [[Emily Post]], emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate [[etiquette]].

Growth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of [[thermographic printing|thermography]]. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique, often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all.

More recently [[Letterpress printing]] has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and [[craft]] appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.

Laser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years.  Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic, or to mark certain types of metal invitations.

The latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organising and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world.

==Text==
Etiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language.  In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in formal, third-person language, saying that the [[Hospitality|host]]s wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. Even in countries like India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow western traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bard Graduate Center|url = http://www.bgc.bard.edu/news/multimedia/academic/indian-wedding.html|website = www.bgc.bard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the bride's parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride's parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., "Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith" or "Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith". The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows:

[[Image:RedBumbleBeeInvitations.JPG|thumb|right|A modern wedding invitation]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith&lt;br /&gt;
request the honour of your presence&lt;br /&gt;
at the wedding of their daughter&lt;br /&gt;
Jessica Marie&lt;br /&gt;
to&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Michael Francis Miller&lt;br /&gt;
on the first of November &lt;br /&gt;
at twelve noon &lt;br /&gt;
Christchurch Hall&lt;br /&gt;
Richmond, Virginia&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the seemingly anglicised spelling 'honour'; this derives from a ruling laid down by [[Emily Post]] in the 1920s.

In the United States, the line "request...presence" is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; "pleasure of your company" is used when it is held elsewhere.

If the groom's parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well.  If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host's name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice:  "The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of..."

Formal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form.

Informal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter.  So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations.

==Printing and design==

Commercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: [[engraving]], [[lithography]], [[thermography]], [[letterpress printing]], sometimes blind [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], compression plate process, or [[offset printing]].  More recently, many [[do-it-yourself]] brides are printing on their home computers using a [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet printer]].  For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in [[calligraphy]].

Historically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical.&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite book
|author=Martin, Judith
|title=Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior
|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co
|location=New York
|year=2005
|pages=390–391
|isbn=0-393-05874-3
|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mass-production was necessary, engraving was preferred over the only other widely available then option, which was a relatively poor quality of letterpress printing.  Hand-written invitations, in the hosts' own handwriting, are still considered most correct whenever feasible; these invitations follow the same formal third-person form as printed ones for formal weddings, and take the form of a personal letter for less formal weddings.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt;

Tissues are often provided by manufacturers to place over the printed text.  Originally, the purpose of the tissue was to reduce smudging or blotting, especially on invitations poorly printed or hastily mailed before the ink was fully dried, but improved printing techniques mean they are now simply decorative.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Post, ''Emily Post on Weddings'', page 65. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who know that their original purpose has been made irrelevant by dramatic improvements in printing technology usually discard them.&lt;ref name="Martin1990"&gt;Martin, Judith. ''Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium''. Simon and Schuster; 1990-11-15 [cited 17 September 2012]. {{ISBN|9780671722289}}. p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern invitation design follows fashion trends.  Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple's personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme.  For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty [[typefaces]] and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple's personality. Some web-based print-on-demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations.

The invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters).  Other options include a sheet of paper, a [[tri-fold]], or a trendy pocket-fold design.  The appropriate [[paper density]] depends on the design, but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock.

==Mailing==
Traditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner [[envelope]] may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing.  More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.

In countries that issue them, the envelope may be [[franking|franked]] with [[love stamp]]s. The [[United States Postal Service|United States postal service]] issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps).

==Other items==

In addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a full panoply of optional printed materials.  The ensemble may include an [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] response card, a separate invitation to a [[wedding reception]], and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations.

Wedding invitations should be sent out 6–8 weeks prior to a wedding with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings.  Guests should be asked to have their reply given between 3 and 2 weeks before the wedding date. Although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day.

These printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, place cards as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes.

==Response==
As with any invitation, the sole obligation of the person receiving it is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Martin, Judith
|title=Miss Manners' guide for the turn-of-the-millennium
|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster
|location=New York
|year=1990
|page=436
|isbn=0-671-72228-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift.

A proper response is written on the recipient's normal [[stationery]], following the form of the invitation.  For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either "Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November", or "Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November."

Pre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation. Some American etiquette experts consider the practice incorrect and ineffective at increasing response rates.&lt;ref name="isbn0-393-06914-1"&gt;{{cite book

The '''world3 nonrenewable resource sector''' is the portion of the [[world3]] model that simulates the [[nonrenewable resource]]s.  The World3 model was a simulation of human interaction with the environment designed in the 1970s to predict population and living standards over the course of the next 100 years.  The nonrenewable resource sector of the world3 model was used to calculate the cost and usage rates of nonrenewable resources.  In the context of this model, nonrenewable resources were resources that there is a finite amount of on Earth, such as iron ore, oil, or coal. This model assumes that regardless of how much money is spent on extraction, there is a finite limit for the amount of nonrenewable resources that can be extracted.

== Overview ==

The model combines all possible nonrenewable resources into one aggregate variable, &lt;tt&gt;nonrenewable_resources&lt;/tt&gt;.  This combines both energy resources and non-energy resources.  Examples of nonrenewable energy resources would include oil and coal.  Examples of material nonrenewable resources would include aluminum and zinc.  This assumption allows costless substitution between any nonrenewable resource.  The model ignores differences between discovered resources and undiscovered resources.

The model assumes that as greater percentages of total nonrenewable resources are used, the amount of effort used to extract the nonrenewable resources will increase.  
The way this cost is done is as a variable &lt;tt&gt;fraction_of_capital_allocated_to_obtaining_resources&lt;/tt&gt;, or abbreviated &lt;tt&gt;fcaor&lt;/tt&gt;.  The way this variable is used is in the equation that calculates industrial output.  Basically, it works  as &lt;tt&gt;effective_output = industrial_capital*other_factors*(1-fcaor)&lt;/tt&gt;.  This causes the amount of resources expended to depend on the amount of industrial capital, and not on the amount of resources consumed.

The consumption of nonrenewable resources is determined by a nonlinear function of the per capita industrial output.  The higher the per capita industrial output, the higher the nonrenewable [[resource consumption]].

[[Image:World3 nonrenewable resource sector.svg]]

== Cost of obtaining nonrenewable resources ==

The fraction of capital allocated to obtaining resources is dependent only on the &lt;tt&gt;nonrenewable_resource_fraction_remaining&lt;/tt&gt;, or abbreviated &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt;.  This variable is the current amount of non-renewable resources divided by the initial amount of non-renewable resources available.  As such &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt; starts out as 1.0 and decreases as world3 runs.  Fraction of capital allocated to obtaining resources is dependent on &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt; as interpolated values from the following table:

{| border="1" 
! NRFR !! FCAOR 
|-
| 0.0 || 1.0
|-
| 0.1 || 0.9
|-
| 0.2 || 0.7
|-
| 0.3 || 0.5
|-
| 0.4 || 0.2
|-
| 0.5 || 0.1
|- 
| 0.6 || 0.05
|-
| 0.7 || 0.05
|-
| 0.8 || 0.05
|-
| 0.9 || 0.05
|-
| 1.0 || 0.05
|}

Qualitatively, this basically states that the relative amount of non-renewable resources decreases, the amount capital required to extract the resources increases.  To more deeply examine this table requires examining the equation that it comes from, &lt;tt&gt;effective_output = industrial_capital*other_factors*(1-fcaor)&lt;/tt&gt; So, if industrial capital and the other factors (described in the capital sector) are the same, then 1 unit of the effective capital when &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt; is 1.0 the effective output is 0.95 (= 1.0 * ( 1 - 0.05)).  So, when nrfr is 0.5, the effective output is 0.90 (= 1.0 * (1 - 0.10)).  Another useful way to look at this equation is to reverse it and see how much effective capital is required to get 1 unit of effective output (i.e. effective_output / (1 - fcaor) = effective_capital).  So, when nrfr is 1.0, the effective capital required for 1 unit of effective output is 1.053 (=1.0/(1-0.05)), and when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2 (=1.0/(1-0.5)).  Lastly is looking at the relative cost required for obtaining the resources.  This based on the fact that it requires 1/19 of a unit of effective capital extra when the nrfr is 1.0.  So, (effective capital required - 1.0) / (1 / 19) will give the relative cost of obtaining the resources compared to the cost of obtaining them when nrfr was 1.0.  For example, when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2.0, and 1.0 of that is for obtaining resources.  So, the cost of obtaining the resources is (2.0 - 1.0) / ( 1 / 19) or 1.0*19 or 19 times the cost when nrfr was 1.0.  Here is a table showing these calculations for all the values:

{| border="1" 
! NRFR !! FCAOR !! Required Capital !! Relative Resource Cost
|-
| 0.0 || 1.0 || ∞ || ∞
|-
| 0.1 || 0.9 || 10.0 || 171.0
|-
| 0.2 || 0.7 || 3.333 || 44.333
|-
| 0.3 || 0.5 || 2.0 || 19.0
|-
| 0.4 || 0.2 || 1.250 || 4.750
|-
| 0.5 || 0.1 || 1.111 || 2.111
|- 
| 0.6 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 0.7 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 0.8 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 0.9 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 1.0 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|}

== Consumption of Nonrenewable Resources ==
The world3 model does not directly link industrial output to resource utilization. Instead, the industrial output per capita is calculated, and that is used to determine resource usage per capita.  This is then multiplied by the total population to determine the total resource consumption.   
Per capita resource utilization multiplier (PCRUM) and Industrial Output per Capita (IOPC)

{| border="1" 
! IOPC !! PCRUM !! PCRUM/IOPC
