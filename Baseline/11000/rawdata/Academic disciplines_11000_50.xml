The goal of academic detailing is to improve prescribing of targeted [[drugs]] to be consistent with [[medical]] evidence from [[randomized controlled trials]], which ultimately improves patient care and can reduce [[health care costs]]. A key component of non-commercial or university-based academic detailing programs is that they (academic detailers/clinical educators, management, staff, program developers, etc.) do not have any financial links to the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

Academic detailing has been studied for over 25 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avorn J, Soumerai SB | year = 1983 | title = Improving drug-therapy decisions through educational outreach.

== Organizations ==
Many academic detailing programs exist around the world. In the [[United States]], university-based state programs exist in [[Vermont]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.med.uvm.edu/ahec/TB1+BL.asp?SiteAreaID=290&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024858/http://pharmacy.oregonstate.edu/drug_policy/index.php?nav=ROAD&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sccp.sc.edu/SCORxE&lt;/ref&gt;  The nonprofit organization Alosa Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alosahealth.org/|title=Alosa Health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs an academic detailing program in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Washington, DC called the Independent Drug Information Service (IDIS). The National Resource Center for Academic Detailing (NaRCAD), funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 2010, was created to help organizations with limited resources to establish and improve their own programs and to create a network of academic detailing programs. The [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] Pharmacy Benefits Management pilot tested the National Academic Detailing Service in 2010 to enhance veterans' outcomes by empowering clinicians and promoting the use of evidence-based treatments using delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbm.va.gov/PBM/academicdetailingservice/AboutUs.asp (Last accessed: 20 October 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; After the pilot, in March 2015, the Interim Under Secretary for Health issued a memorandum requiring implementation of AD programs throughout the [[Veterans Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/VA%20Clancy%20Testimony%203.26.20151.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs also exist in [[Canada]] through the [[Canadian Academic Detailing Collaboration (CADC)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ebm.oscarmcmaster.org/ebm-resources/CADC%20Handout%202008.doc&lt;/ref&gt; including the [https://effectivepractice.org Centre for Effective Practice]'s (CEP) [https://effectivepractice.org/resources/academic-detailing-service/ academic detailing service] in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Margaret|last2=Naumann|first2=Terryn|last3=Regier|first3=Loren|last4=Bugden|first4=Shawn|last5=Allen|first5=Michael|last6=Salach|first6=Lena|last7=Chelak|first7=Kristen|last8=Blythe|first8=Nancy|last9=Gagnon|first9=Antony|date=May 2012|title=A brief overview of academic detailing in Canada: Another role for pharmacists|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal : CPJ|volume=145|issue=3|pages=142–146.e2|doi=10.3821/145.3.cpj142|issn=1715-1635|pmc=3567505|pmid=23509530}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]] through the [[Drug and Therapeutics Information Service]] (DATIS) and the [[National Prescribing Service]] (NPS).

'''Annealing''' of [[glass]] is a process of slowly cooling hot glass objects after they have been formed, to relieve residual internal stresses introduced during manufacture. Especially for smaller, simpler objects, annealing may be incidental to the process of manufacture, but in larger or more complex products it commonly demands a special process of annealing in a temperature-controlled [[kiln]] known as a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]].&lt;ref &gt;E. F. Collins (1921) Electrically heated glass annealing lehr. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 4 (5), pp. 335–349&lt;/ref&gt; Annealing of glass is critical to its durability. Glass that has not been properly annealed retains thermal stresses caused by [[quenching]], which indefinitely decrease the strength and reliability of the product. Inadequately annealed glass is likely to crack or shatter when subjected to relatively small temperature changes or to mechanical shock or stress. It even may fail spontaneously. 

To anneal glass, it is necessary to heat it to its '''annealing [[temperature]]''', at which its [[viscosity]], η, drops to 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;{{citationneeded|date=July 2018}} [[Poise (unit)|Poise]] ("Poise" is a measure of absolute viscosity; 1 poise = 1 dyne-second/cm²). For most kinds of glass, this annealing temperature is in the range of 454–482 °C (850–900 °F){{citationneeded|date=July 2018}}, and is the so-called [[stress (physics)|stress]]-relief point or '''annealing point''' of the glass. At such a viscosity, the glass is still too hard for significant external [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] without breaking, but it is soft enough to relax internal [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]s by microscopic flow in response to the intense stresses they introduce internally. The piece then heat-soaks until its temperature is even throughout and the stress relaxation is adequate. The time necessary for this step varies depending on the type of glass and its maximum thickness. The glass then is permitted to cool at a predetermined rate until its temperature passes the '''strain point''' (η = 10&lt;sup&gt;14.5&lt;/sup&gt; Poise){{citationneeded|date=July 2018}}, below which even microscopic internal flow effectively stops and annealing stops with it. It then is safe to cool the product to [[room temperature]] at a rate limited by the [[heat capacity]], thickness, [[thermal conductivity]], and [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of the glass. After annealing is complete the material can be cut to size, drilled, or polished without risk of its internal stresses shattering it. 

At the ''annealing point'' (η = 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Poise), stresses relax within several minutes, while at the ''strain point'' (η = 10&lt;sup&gt;14.5&lt;/sup&gt; Poise) stresses relax within several hours.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Vogel: "Glass Chemistry"; Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co. K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994), {{ISBN|3-540-57572-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stresses acquired at temperatures above the strain point, and not relaxed by annealing, remain in the glass  indefinitely and may cause either short-term or much delayed failure. Stresses resulting from cooling too rapidly below the strain point largely are considered temporary, although they may be adequate to promote short-term failure.

In [[astronomy]], '''axial tilt''', also known as '''obliquity''', is the angle between an object's [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotational axis]] and its [[orbit]]al axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its [[equator]]ial plane and [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 |isbn=0-935702-68-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[orbital inclination]].

At an obliquity of 0 degrees, the two axes point in the same direction; i.e., the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. Earth's obliquity oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/axial-tilt-obliquity.html |title=Earth Is tilted |website=timeanddate.com |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a 41,000-year cycle; Earth's mean obliquity is currently {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}} and decreasing.
 
Over the course of an [[orbital period]], the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the [[celestial sphere|background]] of [[fixed stars|stars]]. This causes one pole to be directed more toward the [[Sun]] on one side of the [[orbit]], and the other pole on the other side—the cause of the [[season]]s on [[Earth]].

The '''positive''' pole of a planet is defined by the [[right-hand rule]]: if the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction of the rotation then the thumb points to the positive pole. The axial tilt is defined as the angle between the direction of the positive pole and the normal to the orbital plane. The angles for Earth, Uranus and Venus are approximately  23°,  97°, and 177° respectively.

There are two standard methods of specifying tilt. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) defines the ''north pole'' of a planet as that which lies on Earth's north side of the [[invariable plane]] of the [[Solar System]];&lt;ref&gt;''Explanatory Supplement 1992'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; under this system, [[Venus]] is tilted 3° and spins retrograde, opposite that of most of the other planets.&lt;ref name="CorreiaVenusI"&gt;{{cite journal

The IAU also uses the [[Axis–angle representation|right-hand rule]] to define a ''positive pole''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the IAU/IAG Working Group on cartographic coordinates and rotational elements: 2006|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10569-007-9072-y|website=springer.com|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of determining orientation. Using this convention, Venus is tilted 177° ("upside down").

[[Image:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|Earth's axial tilt (obliquity) is currently about 23.4°.]]

[[Earth]]'s [[orbit|orbital plane]] is known as the [[ecliptic]] plane, and [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's tilt]] is known to astronomers as the obliquity of the ecliptic, being the angle between the ecliptic and the [[celestial equator]] on the [[celestial sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by the [[Greek letter]] ''[[Epsilon|ε]]''.

Earth currently has an axial tilt of about 23.4°.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Astronomical Almanac 2010'', p. B52&lt;/ref&gt; This value remains about the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ecliptic (''i.e''., Earth's orbit) moves due to planetary [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]], and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing at a rate of about [[Second of arc|47″]] per [[century]] ''(see details in [[#Short term|Short term]] below)''.

=== History ===

Earth's obliquity may have been reasonably accurately measured as early as 1100 BC in India and China.&lt;ref&gt;

 |bibcode=1979A&amp;A....73..129W
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks had good measurements of the obliquity since about 350 BC, when [[Pytheas]] of Marseilles measured the shadow of a gnomon at the summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 830 AD, the Caliph [[Al-Mamun]] of Baghdad directed his astronomers to measure the obliquity, and the result was used in the Arab world for many years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1437, [[Ulugh Beg]] determined the Earth's axial tilt as 23°30′17″ (23.5047°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L.P.E.A. |last=Sédillot |title=Prolégomènes des tables astronomiques d'OlougBeg: Traduction et commentaire |location=Paris |publisher=Firmin Didot Frères |year=1853 |pages=87 &amp; 253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was widely believed, during the [[Middle Ages]], that both precession and Earth's obliquity oscillated around a mean value, with a period of 672 years, an idea known as ''trepidation'' of the equinoxes. Perhaps the first to realize this was incorrect (during historic time) was [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the fourteenth century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
 |last=Saliba |first=George 
 |date=1994

[[Earth]]'s axis remains tilted in the same direction with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its [[orbit]]). This means that one pole (and the associated [[Hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere of Earth]]) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's [[season]]s. [[Summer]] occurs in the [[Northern hemisphere]] when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term [[climate change]] ''(also see [[Milankovitch cycles]])''.

The exact angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of Earth and [[planets]] over many years. Astronomers produce new [[fundamental ephemeris|fundamental ephemerides]] as the accuracy of [[Observational astronomy|observation]] improves and as the understanding of the [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.

Annual [[almanac]]s are published listing the derived values and methods of use. Until 1983, the [[Astronomical Almanac]]'s angular value of the mean obliquity for any date was calculated based on the [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|work of Newcomb]], who analyzed positions of the planets until about 1895:

:{{math|''ε'' {{=}} 23° 27′ 8.26″ − 46.845″ ''T'' − 0.0059″ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{val|0.00181}}″ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}

where {{math|''ε''}} is the obliquity and {{math|''T''}} is [[Tropical year|tropical centuries]] from [[Epoch (astronomy)|B1900.0]] to the date in question.&lt;ref&gt;

From 1984, the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DE series]] of computer-generated ephemerides took over as the [[fundamental ephemeris]] of the [[Astronomical Almanac]]. Obliquity based on DE200, which analyzed observations from 1911 to 1979, was calculated:

:{{math|''ε'' {{=}} 23° 26′ 21.45″ − 46.815″ ''T'' − 0.0006″ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{val|0.00181}}″ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}

JPL's fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated. For instance, the ''Astronomical Almanac'' for 2010 specifies:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==== Long term ====
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}

Using [[numerical methods]] to simulate [[Solar System]] behavior, long-term changes in Earth's [[orbit]], and hence its obliquity, have been investigated over a period of several million years. For the past 5 million years, Earth's obliquity has varied between {{nowrap|22° 2′ 33″}} and {{nowrap|24° 30′ 16″}}, with a mean period of 41,040 years. This cycle is a combination of precession and the largest [[Term (mathematics)|term]] in the motion of the [[ecliptic]]. For the next 1 million years, the cycle will carry the obliquity between {{nowrap|22° 13′ 44″}} and {{nowrap|24° 20′ 50″}}.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Moon]] has a stabilizing effect on Earth's obliquity. Frequency map analysis conducted in 1993 suggested that, in the absence of the Moon, the obliquity can change rapidly due to [[orbital resonance]]s and [[Stability of the Solar System|chaotic behavior]] of the Solar System, reaching as high as 90° in as little as a few million years ''(also see [[Orbit of the Moon]])''.&lt;ref name="LaskarRobutel"&gt;

== Solar System bodies ==

All four of the innermost, rocky planets of the [[Solar System]] may have had large variations of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move ([[axial precession]]), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=William Ward|title=Large-Scale Variations in the Obliquity of Mars|journal=Science|date=20 July 1973|doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.260|bibcode=1973Sci...181..260W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate varies due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] and [[Planetary core|core]]-[[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, [[orbital resonance]]s may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its [[Moon#Formation|capture]], Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. [[Mars]]'s obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as 0° to 60° over some millions of years, depending on [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of the planets.&lt;ref name="LaskarRobutel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The occasional shifts in the axial tilt of Mars have been suggested as an explanation for the appearance and disappearance of rivers and lakes over the course of the existence of Mars.

The stellar obliquity {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. the axial tilt of a star with respect to the orbital plane of one of its planets, has been determined for only a few systems. But for 49 stars as of today, the sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment {{math|''λ''}} has been observed,&lt;ref name=HRM&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as a lower limit to {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Most of these measurements rely on the [[Rossiter–McLaughlin effect]]. So far, it has not been possible to constrain the obliquity of an extrasolar planet. But the rotational flattening of the planet and the entourage of moons and/or rings, which are traceable with high-precision photometry, e.g. by the space-based [[Kepler spacecraft]], could provide access to {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the near future.

Astrophysicists have applied tidal theories to predict the obliquity of [[extrasolar planets]]. It has been shown that the obliquities of exoplanets in the [[habitable zone]] around low-mass stars tend to be eroded in less than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years,&lt;ref name=Heller_2011&gt;

The '''Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/business/2016/09/29/efforts-unlock-potentials-blue-economy/|title=Efforts on to unlock potentials of blue economy {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|date=2016-09-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdnews24.com/business/2016/08/12/bangladesh-starts-new-fiscal-with-plummeting-exports|title=Bangladesh starts new fiscal with plummeting exports|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশ উন্নয়ন গবেষণা প্রতিষ্ঠান (বিআইডিএস)}}) is an autonomous  multi-disciplinary public research organization that conducts policy research on development issues for [[Bangladesh]]. Supported by the [[Government of Bangladesh]], BIDS functions as a [[think tank]], helping formulate socio-economic policies. The institute conducts research and promotes study and education in development economics, rural development, demographics and social sciences.

==History==

The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies had its origin in Pakistan, named as the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and established in June 1957. The PIDE was moved to Dhaka in January 1971. After the emergence of independent Bangladesh in 1971, the Institute was called the Bangladesh Institute of Development Economics (BIDE). Later on, a Parliamentary Charter was awarded in 1974 and the Institute was renamed as the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) to reflect its multidisciplinary focus of development research. It was incorporated as an autonomous body, governed by a high powered Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Planning, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Since 1974, through a process of national level institutional restructuring, two other institutions––the Population Study Centre and the National Foundation for Research on Human Resources Development–– were merged with BIDS in 1982 and 1983 respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Institute_of_Development_Studies|title=Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, funding for BIDS was made through regular government budgetary support. In 1983, the Government created an endowment fund to ensure a source of recurring revenue for running the Institute, thereby reducing its dependence on regular budgetary support, and enabling BIDS to enjoy more functional autonomy. In 2009, the Government provided a Research Endowment Fund of Tk. 200 million to support core institutional research of BIDS. Some donor agencies and foundations also provide resources for its activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==

The Publication Section publishes books, journals, policy briefs, monographs, and other reports for promoting a wide dissemination of BIDS research activities and findings. The Section, with equipment to meet the Institute's publishing requirements, also provides sales services to its local and foreign customers and promotes BIDS publication through complimentary and exchange programs. The BIDS publications have wide circulation amongst researchers, policymakers and the general readers.

[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|210px|General structure of a continuous stirred-tank type bioreactor]]

A '''bioreactor''' may refer to any [[manufacture]]d or [[engineering|engineered]] device or system that supports a biologically active environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=bioreactor|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/B00662.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a bioreactor is a vessel in which a [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is carried out which involves [[organism]]s or [[biochemistry|biochemically]] active [[chemical substance|substance]]s derived from such organisms. This process can either be [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]. These bioreactors are commonly cylindrical, ranging in size from litres to cubic metres, and are often made of [[stainless steel]].

It may also refer to a device or system designed to grow [[Cell (biology)|cells]] or [[Biological tissue|tissues]] in the context of [[cell culture]]. These devices are being developed for use in [[tissue engineering]] or [[biochemical engineering]].

On the basis of '''mode of operation''', a bioreactor may be classified as [[batch reactor|batch]], [[fed-batch|fed batch]] or [[continuous reactor|continuous]] (e.g. a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor model]]). An example of a continuous bioreactor is the [[chemostat]].

Organisms growing in bioreactors may be submerged in liquid medium or may be attached to the surface of a solid medium. Submerged cultures may be suspended or immobilized. Suspension bioreactors can use a wider variety of organisms, since special attachment surfaces are not needed, and can operate at much larger scale than immobilized cultures. However, in a continuously operated process the organisms will be removed from the reactor with the effluent. Immobilization is a general term describing a wide variety of cell or particle attachment or entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez A, Lazaro N, Marques AM. The interphase technique: a simple method of cell
immobilization in gel-beads. J Microbiol Methods, 1997, 30:231-234.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to basically all types of
biocatalysis including enzymes, cellular organelles, animal and plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;Peinado PA, Moreno JJ, Villaba JM, Gonzalez-Reyes JA, Ortega JM, Mauricio JC. A new immobilization method and their applications. Enzyme Microb Tech, 2006, 40:79-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Immobilization is useful for continuously operated processes, since the organisms will not be removed with the reactor effluent, but is limited in scale because the microbes are only present on the surfaces of the vessel.

Large scale immobilized cell bioreactors are:

*[[packed bed]]
*[[fibrous bed]]

==Design==
[[Image:Pg166 bioreactor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A closed bioreactor used in cellulosic ethanol research]]

Bioreactor design is a relatively complex engineering task, which is studied in the discipline of [[biochemical engineering]]. Under optimum conditions, the microorganisms or cells are able to perform their desired function with limited production of impurities. The environmental conditions inside the bioreactor, such as temperature, nutrient concentrations, pH, and dissolved gases (especially oxygen for aerobic fermentations) affect the growth and productivity of the organisms. The temperature of the fermentation medium is maintained by a cooling jacket, coils, or both. Particularly exothermic fermentations may require the use of external heat exchangers. Nutrients may be continuously added to the fermenter, as in a fed-batch system, or may be charged into the reactor at the beginning of fermentation. The pH of the medium is measured and adjusted with small amounts of acid or base, depending upon the fermentation. For aerobic (and some anaerobic) fermentations, reactant gases (especially oxygen) must be added to the fermentation. Since oxygen is relatively insoluble in water (the basis of nearly all fermentation media), air (or purified oxygen) must be added continuously. The action of the rising bubbles helps mix the fermentation medium and also "[[air stripping|strips]]" out waste gases, such as carbon dioxide. In practice, bioreactors are often pressurized; this increases the [[Henry's law|solubility of oxygen]] in water. In an aerobic process, optimal oxygen transfer is sometimes the rate limiting step. [[Oxygen]] is poorly soluble in water—even less in warm fermentation broths—and is relatively scarce in [[air]] (20.95%). Oxygen transfer is usually helped by agitation, which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the fermentation homogeneous. [[Mixing (process engineering)#Liquid-gas mixing|Gas dispersing agitators]] are used to break up air bubbles and circulate them throughout the vessel.

''[[Fouling]]'' can harm the overall efficiency of the bioreactor, especially the [[heat exchanger]]s. To avoid it, the bioreactor must be easily cleaned. Interior surfaces are typically made of stainless steel for easy cleaning and sanitation. Typically bioreactors are cleaned between batches, or are designed to reduce fouling as much as possible when operated continuously. Heat transfer is an important part of bioreactor design; small vessels can be cooled with a cooling jacket, but larger vessels may require coils or an external heat exchanger.

==Types==

===Photobioreactor===
[[File:Bioreaktor quer2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Moss bioreactor|Moss photobioreactor]] with ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'']]
A [[photobioreactor]] (PBR) is a bioreactor which incorporates some type of light source (that may be natural sunlight or artificial illumination). Virtually any [[translucent]] container could be called a PBR, however the term is more commonly used to define a closed system, as opposed to an open [[tank]] or [[pond]].
Photobioreactors are used to grow small [[phototroph]]ic organisms such as [[cyanobacteria]], [[alga]]e, or [[moss]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;Eva L. Decker und [[Ralf Reski]] (2008): Current achievements in the production of complex [[biopharmaceuticals]] with moss
bioreactor. Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering 31, 3-9 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/ux267q4q14736845/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms use light through [[photosynthesis]] as their [[energy]] source and do not require [[sugar]]s or [[lipid]]s as energy
source. Consequently, risk of [[contamination]] with other organisms like [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[fungus|fungi]] is lower in
photobioreactors when compared to bioreactors for [[heterotroph]] organisms.

===Personal bioreactors===
A simplified continuous bioreactor that is designed for non-professionals, enables the growth of E. coli bacteria cells under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. These bioreactors do not rely on autoclavability, but instead rely on chemical inactivation for reuse. A laptop-sized Personal Bioreactor and Transformation station for bioengineering. It includes: continuous culturing system with remote-monitoring, real time date streaming, on-screen instructions, plate incubator, heat + ice-cold stations. Suitable for bacterial growth and culturing.
[[File:Personal bioreactor for non-professionals.png|thumb|Personal bioreactor for non-professionals]]

===Sewage treatment===
Conventional [[sewage treatment]] utilises bioreactors to undertake the main purification processes. In some of these systems,  a chemically inert medium with very high surface area is provided as a substrate for the growth of  biological film.  Separation of excess biological film takes place in  settling tanks or cyclones . In other systems [[Water aeration#Aeration methods|aerator]]s supply oxygen to the sewage and biota to create [[activated sludge]] in which the biological component is freely mixed in the liquor in "flocs". In these processes, the liquid's [[Biochemical Oxygen Demand]] (BOD) is reduced sufficiently to render the contaminated water fit for reuse. The biosolids can be collected for further processing, or dried and used as fertilizer. An extremely simple version of a sewage bioreactor is a septic tank whereby the sewage is left in situ, with or without additional media to house bacteria. In this instance, the biosludge itself is the primary host for the bacteria.

===NASA tissue cloning bioreactor===
[[File:Loading bioreactor.jpg|thumb|A bioreactor used to ferment ethanol from corncob waste being loaded with yeast.]]
In bioreactors in which the goal is to grow cells or tissues for experimental or therapeutic purposes, the design is significantly different from industrial bioreactors. Many cells and tissues, especially mammalian ones, must have a surface or other structural support in order to grow, and agitated environments are often destructive to these cell types and tissues. Higher organisms, being [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophic]], also require highly specialized growth media.

[[NASA]] has developed a new type of bioreactor that artificially grows tissue in cell cultures.  NASA's tissue bioreactor can grow heart tissue, skeletal tissue, ligaments, cancer tissue for study, and other types of tissue.&lt;ref&gt;https://science.nasa.gov/NEWHOME/headlines/msad05oct99_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For more information on artificial tissue culture, see [[tissue engineering]].

== Modelling ==
Mathematical models act as an important tool in various bio-reactor applications including wastewater treatment. These models are useful for planning efficient [[process control]] strategies and predicting the future plant performance. Moreover, these models are beneficial in education and research areas.

Bioreactors are generally used in those industries which are concerned with food, beverages and pharmaceuticals. The emergence of ''[[Biochemical engineering]]'' is of recent origin. Processing of biological materials using biological agents such as cells, enzymes or antibodies are the major pillars of biochemical engineering. Applications of biochemical engineering cover major fields of civilization such as agriculture, food and healthcare, [[resource recovery]] and fine chemicals.

Till now, the industries associated with biotechnology have been lagged behind other industries in implementing control over the process and optimization strategies. A main drawback in biotechnological process control is the problem to measure key physical and biochemical parameters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/modynsyst/vt11/Lecture/DynSystBior2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational stages in a bio-process ===
A bioprocess is composed mainly of three stages &amp;mdash; upstream processing, bioreaction, and downstream processing &amp;mdash; to convert raw material to finished product.

The raw material can be of biological or non-biological origin. It is first converted to more suitable form for processing. This is done in upstream processing step which involves chemical hydrolysis, preparation of liquid medium, separation of particulate, air purification and many other preparatory operations.

After upstream processing step, the resulting feed is transferred to one or more Bioreaction stages. The Biochemical reactors or bioreactors form the base of the Bioreaction step. This step is mainly consists of three operations namely, production of [[biomass]], metabolize biosynthesis and biotransformation.

Finally, the material produced in the bioreactor must be further processed in the downstream section to convert it into more useful form. The downstream process is mainly consists of physical separation operations which includes, solid liquid separation, [[adsorption]], [[Liquid–liquid extraction|liquid-liquid extraction]], [[distillation]], [[drying]] etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CHEMICAL PROCESS MODELLING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION|last=Jana|first=AMIYA K.|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specifications ===
A typical bioreactor consists of following parts:

'''Agitator –''' used for the mixing of the contents of the reactor which keeps the “cells” in the perfect homogenous condition for better transport of nutrients and oxygen to the desired product(s).

'''Baffle –'''  used to break the vortex formation in the vessel, which is usually highly undesirable as it changes the center of gravity of the system and consumes additional power.

'''Sparger –''' In aerobic cultivation process, the purpose of the sparger is to supply adequate oxygen to the growing cells.

'''Jacket –''' The jacket provides the annular area for circulation of constant temperature of water which keeps the temperature of the bioreactor at a constant value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iitd.vlab.co.in/?sub=63&amp;brch=177&amp;sim=647&amp;cnt=1|title=Bioreactor- Basics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of modelling equations for bioreactors ===
{{Tone|section|date=July 2016}}
{{Move to Wikiversity|date=July 2016}}

Assumptions –
* The reactor contents are perfectly mixed together.
* The reactor is operating at a constant temperature (i.e., it is isothermal).
* The feed should be clean and pure (i.e., no biomass in the feed stream).
* The feed stream and reactor contents have equal and constant density (''ρ).''
* The feed and product streams have the same flow rate (F).

==== Total continuity equation ====
Making overall mass balance, we get the following equation:

d(''ρV)/dt     =    Fρ – Fρ     =    0                                                           (1)''

Equation(1) states that the reactor volume (V) is constant since dV/dt = 0.

==== Biomass continuity equation ====
We know,

Flow rate of biomass into the reactor = Fx&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Flow rate of biomass out of the reactor = Fx

Rate of generation of biomass by reaction = Vr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

Rate of accumulation of biomass within the reactor = d(Vx)/dt

Now, apply general mass balance equation i.e.,

''Rate of Mass In – Rate of Mass Out + Rate of Generation = Accumulation''

d(Vx)/dt =  Fx&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – Fx + Vr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                     (2)

Where '''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the rate of cell generation. Dividing both sides of the above equation by V, we obtain

dx/dt = (F/V)x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – (F/V)x + r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                  (3)

In the [[chemical reaction engineering]], '''F/V''' is called '''space velocity'''(s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and '''V/F''' is called the '''residence time''' (s). But in [[biochemical engineering]], '''F/V''' is known as '''Dilution rate (D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)'''. Accordingly, equation(3) yields:

dx/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;x + r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                           (4)

dx/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – x) + r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                            (5)

==== Substrate continuity equation ====
For substrate balance,

Flow rate of substrate into the bioreactor   = FS&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Flow of the substrate out of the bioreactor = FS

Rate of generation of substrate by reaction = –Vr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Rate of accumulation of substrate within the reactor = d(VS)/dt

Now, apply general mass balance equation i.e.,

''Rate of Mass In – Rate of Mass Out + Rate of Generation = Accumulation''

d(VS)/dt = FS&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;  – FS – Vr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                       (6)

rearranging above equation, we get

dS/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; –S ) – r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                             (7)

where '''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the rate of substrate consumption.

==== Biochemical reaction kinetics ====
For the chemical reaction,

A ----&gt; P

We can write

( –r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = k (C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;                                                                                                                (8)

(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = – k (C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;                                                                                                                (9)

Where,

( –r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)  = rate of disappearance of A

(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)     = rate of formation of A

k         = reaction rate constant

C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;       = Concentration of reactant A

n          = order of reaction with respect to component A

For first order reaction, n  = 1 and accordingly,

–r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = k C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;

The reaction kinetics involved in biochemical operations is comparatively difficult to obtain than the chemical reaction kinetics. In biochemical operations, the cell kinetics is used for the unstructured models where balanced growth condition is assumed.

The following equation is used to represent the net  rate of cell mass growth:

r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μx                                                                                                  (10)''

''where μ'' is the specific growth rate or specific growth rate coefficient(s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Here, ''μ'' is analogous to first order rate constant k but however, ''μ'' is not a constant.

In biochemical engineering, '''yield''' is defined as the ratio of mass or moles of product formed to the mass or moles of the reactants consumed. The yield (Y) of product (P) with respect to reactant A is defined as:

Y = (mass of P formed )/(mass of A consumed)                                  (11)

In case of bioreactor,

Y = (mass of cells formed)/(mass of substrate consumed)                  (12)

Thus,

Y = r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/ r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Or,

r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Y

Or,

r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μx/''Y                                       ( from 10)                                        (13)

==== Final form of equation of modelling ====
By substituting equations (10) &amp; (13) in equations (5) &amp; (7) respectively, we get,

'''dx/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – x) + ''μx'''''                                                                                                      (14)

'''dS/dt = S(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – S) – (''μx/Y)'''''                                                                                                 (15)

Since we have assumed that the feed stream does not contain any biomass i.e., '''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''', then, bioreactor modelling equation finally get the following form:

'''dx/dt = (''μ'' – D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)x'''                                                                                                               (16)

'''dS/dt = S(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – S) – (''μx/Y)'''''                                                                                              ''(from 15)''

Thus,Equations (15) and (16) are the basic equations which are used for the modelling of any bioreactor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7124">'''Brain-body interactions''' are patterns of neural activity in the [[central nervous system]] to coordinate the activity between the brain and body. The nervous system consists of [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] nervous systems and coordinates the actions of an animal by transmitting [[Action potential|signals]] to and from different parts of its body. The [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] are interwoven with the body and interact with other [[organ system]]s through the [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]], [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] and [[Enteric nervous system|enteric]] nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freund|first=Patrick|last2=Friston|first2=Karl|last3=Thompson|first3=Alan J.|last4=Stephan|first4=Klaas E.|last5=Ashburner|first5=John|last6=Bach|first6=Dominik R.|last7=Nagy|first7=Zoltan|last8=Helms|first8=Gunther|last9=Draganski|first9=Bogdan|date=2016|title=Embodied neurology: an integrative framework for neurological disorders|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=139|issue=Pt 6|pages=1855–1861|doi=10.1093/brain/aww076|issn=1460-2156|pmc=4892755|pmid=27105896|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neural pathway]]s regulate brain-body interactions and allow to [[Interoception|sense]] and [[Motor control|control]] its body and interact with the environment.

This skyscraper stands on the site of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}''. (Photo taken from {{lang|fr|Rue Samaritaine}}).]]
In [[urban planning]], '''Brusselization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK and US]]) or '''Brusselisation '''([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK variant]]) ({{lang-fr|bruxellisation}}, {{lang-nl|verbrusseling}}) is "the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighbourhoods" and has become a byword for "haphazard urban development and redevelopment".{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}

The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of [[Brussels]] in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of [[zoning]] regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Papadopoulos|1996|p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romańczyk, K.

== Brussels ==

=== From the 1960s to the 1980s ===
The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of [[Brussels]] in connection with [[Expo 58]]. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance,{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of [[townhouse]]s for development of the high-rise business district in the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]]. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.

Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]],{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} beginning with the construction of the [[European Commission]] headquarters in 1959.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near [[Brussels-South railway station]].

These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[preservationism|preservationist]] organizations. The demolition of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}'' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}

Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as {{lang|fr|[[Léon Krier]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Maurice Culot]]}} formulated an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.{{sfn|Lagrou|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}

=== Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels ===
The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after [[Paris]], which were created by [[covering of the Senne|covering and diverting the Senne]] river, and the [[North–South connection|North–South railway connection]], which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]], the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. [[André de Vries]] asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the [[bombardment of Brussels|bombardment of the city]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s troops in 1695. "There is barely one building still standing", he says, "from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall".{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.{{sfn|Swyngedouw|Moyersoen|2006|p=158}}

=== The 1990s: From Brusselization to façadism ===
[[File:Brusselisation in bucharest.jpg|thumb|250px|Brusselization in contemporary [[Bucharest]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}]]
In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} This led to the rise of what was termed ''{{lang|fr|[[facadism|façadisme]]}}'' — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic [[façade]].{{sfn|Hein|2004|p=264}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the [[Brussels Capital Region]] the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ''{{lang|fr|permis unique}}'' system was this internecine conflict resolved.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''ChaNGa (Charm N-body GrAvity solver)''' is a computer program to perform [[n-body cosmological simulation|collisionless ''N''-body simulations]]. It can perform cosmological simulations with periodic boundary conditions in comoving coordinates or simulations of isolated stellar systems. It is based on the [[Barnes–Hut simulation|Barnes–Hut]] algorithm and uses [[Ewald summation]] for periodic forces.

ChaNGa makes use of the [[Charm++]] parallel programming system, including its dynamic load balancing schemes, in order to scale to large processor configurations. Simulation results have been reported on up to 20,000 [[Blue Gene|IBM Bluegene/L]] processors [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512011208/http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/papers/ChaNGaIPDPS08.shtml].

[[Image:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|A chimeric mouse with its [[offspring]]]]
A '''genetic chimerism''' or '''chimera''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/kɪˈmɪərə/]] or [[Help:IPA/English|/kaɪˈmɪərə/]], also '''chimaera''' (c''himæra'') is a single organism composed of cells with distinct [[genotype]]s. In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; (this is just one of many different ways that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].

==Animals==
An animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

This condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref name="Strain" /&gt; Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

===Tetragametic chimerism===
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the organism develops, it can come to possess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s that have different sets of [[chromosome]]s. For example, the chimera may have a [[liver]] composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a [[kidney]] composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests that it is not the case.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Aaron|author2=Ozzie Zehner|title=Which Half Is Mommy?: Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=Fall/Winter|pages=106–127|url=https://ucdavis.academia.edu/AaronTNorton/Papers/126923/Which_Half_Is_Mommy_Tetragametic_Chimerism_and_Trans-Subjectivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boklage, C.E. How New Humans Are Made. Hackensack, NJ; London: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true for the [[marmoset]]. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross2007" /&gt; 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through [[chorionic]] fusions, making them [[hematopoietic]] chimeras.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=cell|title=Generation of Chimeric Rhesus Monkeys| author=Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]]| date=January 2012| pmc=3264685| pmid=22225614| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.007| volume=148| pages=285–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N.| last1=Gengozian| last2=Batson| first2=JS| first3=P.| last3=Eide| title=Hematologic and Cytogenetic Evidence for Hematopoietic Chimerism in the Marmoset, Tamarinus Nigricollis| journal=Cytogenetics| year=1964| volume=10| pages=384–393.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (''e.g.'', having a [[Thumb#Variations|hitchhiker's thumb]] and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75| title=2 ) In the chimera episode, the fact that the [subject] was a chimera was first established through a camera flash on the skin illuminating skin anomalies...| work=Ask a Geneticist| publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford School of Medicine]]| author= Barry Starr | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Note that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics. 

Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]]s and [[calico cat|calico]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The existence of chimerism is problematic for DNA testing, a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel) |Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Microchimerism===
{{Main| Microchimerism}}

Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers' have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.
The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmc = 3023624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ceratiidae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline chimerism===
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has recently been discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings, because of placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)&lt;ref name="Ross2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ross| first=C. N.|author2=J. A. French | author3=G.

* The Dutch sprinter [[Foekje Dillema]] was expelled from the 1950 national team after she refused a mandatory sex test in July 1950; later investigations revealed a Y-chromosome in her body cells, and the analysis showed that she probably was a 46,XX/46,XY mosaic female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ballantyne | first1 = KN | last2 = Kayser | first2 = M | last3 = Grootegoed | first3 = JA | year =2011 | title = 'Sex and gender issues in competitive sports: investigation of a historical case leads to a new viewpoint' | url = | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 46| issue = 8| pages = 614–7| doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2010.082552 | pmid=21540190 | pmc=3375582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In biological research, chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which form from the fusion of [[gametes]] from two species that form a single [[zygote]] with a combined genetic makeup. Nor are they [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]], which, as with hybrids, result from the fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. "Chimera" is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As with cloning, the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise, with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating. Successes, however, have led to major advancements in the field of embryology, as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits, such as colour, has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from [[totipotent]] four cell blastocysts; although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"/&gt;

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984, when a chimeric [[sheep-goat chimera|geep]] was produced by combining [[embryo]]s from a [[goat]] and a [[sheep]], and survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921546,00.html | title = It's a Geep | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 27 February 1984 | accessdate = 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the "geep" revealed several complexities to chimera development. In implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep, the sheep's immune system would reject the developing goat embryo, whereas a "geep" embryo (sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats) was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In August 2003, researchers at the [[Shanghai Second Medical University]] in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and [[rabbit]] ova to create the first human chimeric embryos. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting, then destroyed to harvest the resulting [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html| title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy| last=Mott| first=Maryann| date=January 25, 2005| work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, scientists at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |title=Iranian scientist creates sheep with half-human organs |date=27 Mar 2007 |work=[[Press TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114210217/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.
The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W. K. | title = "Intrinsic" Immunological Tolerance in Allophenic Mice | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3807 | pages = 1484–6 | year = 1967 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3807.1484 |pmid=6058691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90161-7 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = EJ | year = 1986 | title = Pluripotential stem cell lines as a route into the mouse germ line | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. | volume = 85 | issue = 22| pages = 8583–8587 | pmid = 3186749 | pmc = 282503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155–6163 | pmid = 14623817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 283–290 | pmid = 1033982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pappaioannou, V., R. Johnson. (1993). Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells. In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (ed. A.Joyner) IRL Press at Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
From this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90143-0 | last1 = Kubiak | first1 = J | last2 = Tarkowski | first2 = A. | year = 1985 | title = Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.

Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (Joyner, A, ed.) IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804–8808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603–613 | pmid = 11187956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse, which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells.&lt;ref&gt;Chimera Mouse production by blastocyst injection, Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = M | last2 = Hadjantonakis | first2 = AK | last3 = Nagy | first3 = A | title = Aggregation chimeras.

==Plants==

===Structure===
The distinction between sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal '''plant chimeras''' are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5LwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;dq=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38m0Tee4O8ns0gHR0JGWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' The plastids: their chemistry, structure, growth and inheritance''], 2nd edition,1978, Elsevier/ North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-80022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c0JLPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Mutation+breeding+techniques+and+behavior+of+irradiated+shoot+apices+of+potato&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=18q0TYacDajg0gGp9b31CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' Mutation breeding techniques and behavior of irradiated shoot apices of potato''], 1978, Pudoc, Wageingen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graft chimeras===
{{Main|Graft-chimaera}}
[[File:Taxus-mosaic1.JPG|thumb| [[Taxus]] mosaic.]]
These are produced by grafting genetically different parents, different [[cultivar]]s or different species (which may belong to different genera). The tissues may be partially fused together following [[grafting]] to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norris, R. |author2=Smith, R.H. |author3=Vaughn, K.C. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Plant chimeras used to establish de novo origin of shoots | journal=Science | year=1983 | pages=75–76 | volume=220 | doi=10.1126/science.220.4592.75 | issue=4592 | pmid=17736164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their [[periclinal]] chimeras is like to be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9rxMGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Plant+Chimeras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fCO6Te3DEoKutweGpaC3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ ''Plant Chimeras''], 1st edition, 1992, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such known chimera was probably the [[Bizzaria]], which is a fusion of the [[Florentine citron]] and the [[sour orange]]. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], caused by a fusion of a ''[[Laburnum]]'' and a [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a [[rootstock]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Chromosomal chimeras===
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their [[chromosome]] constitution. Occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to [[cell division|misdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson, J.D. |author2=Herre, E.A. |author3=Hamrick, J.L. |author4=Stone, J.L. |last-author-amp=yes| title= Genetic Mosaics in strangler Fig Trees: Implication for Tropical Conservation | journal=Science | year=1991 | pages=1214–1216 | volume=254 | issue=5035 | doi= 10.1126/science.254.5035.1214 | pmid=17776412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

===Nuclear gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Plastid gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or [[nucleic acid thermodynamics]], plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their [[mendelian inheritance|non-mendelian inheritance]]. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the [[chloroplast]]s in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Origins===
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage:

(1) The process of shoot [[organogenesis]] starts form the multicellular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhu, X. |author2=Zhao, M. |author3=Ma, S. |author4=Ge, Y. |author5=Zhang, M. |author6=Chen, L. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Induction and origin of adventitious shoots from chimeras of Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=1727–1732 | volume=26 | issue=10 | doi=10.1007/s00299-007-0398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.

(3) A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park SH, Rose SC, Zapata C, Srivatanakul M | title= Cross-protection and selectable marker genes in plant transformation. | journal= In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant| year=1998 | pages=117–121 | volume=34 | issue=2 | doi= 10.1007/BF02822775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Detection===
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] and [[Green Fluorescent Protein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rakosy-Tican, E. |author2=Aurori, C.M. |author3=Dijkstra, C. |author4=Thieme, R. |author5=Aurori, A. |author6=Davey, M.R. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The usefulness of the gfp reporter gene for monitoring Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato dihaploid and tetraploid genotypes | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=661–671 | volume=26 | issue=5 | doi=10.1007/s00299-006-0273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. [[Quantitative PCR]] could be an alternative method for chimera detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Faize, M., Faize, L. and Burgos, L. | title=Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect chimeras in transgenic tobacco and apricot and to monitor their dissociation | journal=BMC Biotechnology | year=2010 | pages=53 | volume=10 | issue=1 | doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and legislation==
{{See also|Bioethics}}

===Ethics===
The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Futehally, Ilmas, Beyond Biology, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] [http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=77#.UyZHJ1GSxv0]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights.&lt;ref name="Defining Humanity"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 – Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{anchor|Chimera_(genetics)#Legislation}}&lt;!-- linked from [[Human Chimera Prohibition Act]] --&gt;In May 2008, a robust debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories, given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 11 July 2005, a bill, The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator 
[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"/&gt; Since the bill's death in congress, there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11335">'''ClearCurve''' is [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]]'s brand name for a new [[optical fiber]] that can be bent around short-radius curves without losing its signal. It is constructed with a conventional fiber on the inside, surrounded by a cladding containing a new nanostructured reflector. ClearCurve is hundreds of times more flexible than conventional optical cable, transmitting high-quality signals even when wrapped around small objects like a pen, where a conventional cable would lose the signal completely.

Although originally introduced to serve the needs of pulling fiber in apartment buildings and other high-density units where conventional fiber is too inflexible, in 2009 [[Intel]] announced their intention to use it as the basis of a new computer interconnect system code-named [[Light Peak]]. ClearCurve's small size and high bandwidth capabilities offer great improvements over existing copper wiring in this role, and Intel is positioning Light Peak as a truly universal bus that can carry any existing traffic over a single cable.

==Background==
===Conventional fiber===
[[Image:Optical fiber cable.jpg|thumb|right|Conventional single-mode long-haul optical fiber cable.]]

Conventional optical fiber consists of a thin inner cylindrical core of glass or plastic with a similar material layered in a thin coating around it. Slight differences in the [[index of refraction]] between the two layers causes [[total internal reflection]], trapping a light beam inside the inner core. This process is limited to a [[total internal reflection#Critical angle|critical angle]]; when the light beam approaches the interface at a shallow angle most of it will be reflected, but as it gets closer to the critical angle more and more will travel through the interface and be lost.&lt;ref name=works&gt;Craig Freudenrich, [http://www.howstuffworks.com/fiber-optic.htm "How Fiber Optics Work"], How Stuff Works&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical angle depends on the relative difference in index of refraction, larger differences will increase the critical angle and trap more light. However, changing the index of refraction in most materials generally changes its mechanical properties too, which means that different types of cables are used for different purposes. Cables intended to be highly efficient over long runs are generally less flexible, while those that require higher flexibility are generally only useful for shorter distances. Even cables designed to be flexible, like [[TOSLINK]], are less flexible than a similar sized [[Flexible cables|braided copper cable]].

To keep the fibers as straight as possible, most high-performance optical cables use a form of armour that resists tight bending. This is normally a helical winding, similar to [[BX cable]], or a series of straight fibers running parallel to the core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcelect.com/fibercable.htm "The Basics of Fiber Optical Cable"]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the armour is fairly large, the cables normally carry a number of fibers inside. The resulting armoured bundle is then surrounded in an environmental cladding, typically plastic. The bundle is about the size of a conventional power cable found on an electrical appliance, but much less flexible.

===Fiber to the home===
Optical cabling has long formed the backbone of major terrestrial networks, delivering signals over long distances. The signals are then converted into other forms at the company [[end office]]s, and distributed from there in some other form, typically telephone wiring or coax cable in the case of [[cable television]]. The multi-fiber armoured cable is well suited to this role.

Since the 1990s there has been an ongoing effort to supply [[fiber to the home]] (FTTH). Using fiber to deliver signals all the way to the home provides the same advantages as it does on the longer hauls, namely much higher bandwidth, lower costs, and less interference with other sources. However, given the deliberate lack of flexibility of the cable, these installations generally end in a utility room where they are converted to copper for distribution within the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftthcouncil.eu/documents/studies/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf "Definition of Terms"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, FTTH Council, 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While this sort of installation is useful for individual dwellings, it is less useful in large multi-unit dwellings. Corning estimates that an apartment installation would require an average of twelve right angle turns between the distribution point and the units. Conventional fiber would lose the signal after one or two such bends, making it useless in this role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/clearcurve/single_mode/bendable.aspx "The ultimately flexible fiber"], Corning, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case for individual homes, the fiber can be converted to copper for the last section of delivery, but the longer runs demand much higher performance, larger cable. Finding room to run these cables in an existing structure may not be possible.

==ClearCurve==
ClearCurve fibers are constructed in a fashion similar to existing cables, starting with a traditional glass fiber in the center. ClearCurve then adds a third layer to the sandwich, a plastic sheath that is infused with microscopic reflectors. Light that passes through the conventional interface has a second chance to be reflected back into the center of the fiber. In the corners of tight bends, the reflectors serve to increase the amount of signal retained within the cable, allowing ClearCurve to be hundreds of times more flexible than conventional cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com:80/clearcurve/index.aspx "Bend the rules"], Corning, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mehta/&gt; A thin environmental sheath is added on the outside.

Unlike conventional fibers, ClearCurve does not have to be held straight, and therefore eliminates the armour. Lacking armour, there is no lower limit to the size of a ClearCurve cable, which can be as small as a single fiber, although normally they contain two fibres, one upstream and one down. Two-fiber ClearCurve cables are smaller than the wire on a typical [[computer mouse]], yet the high-performance single-mode versions carry 25&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s over long lengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/clearcurve/single_mode/high_speed.aspx "Nearly unlimited bandwidth for broadband"], Corning, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video demonstration, Corning showed a ClearCurve drop cable being wrapped dozens of times around a small metal rod, and suffering almost no signal loss and providing a perfect video feed. A conventional cable wrapped around the same rod completely lost the signal after only two turns.

===FTTH uses===
ClearCurve is the end result of a Corning research project looking for products better tailored to the fiber to the home market.&lt;ref name=mehta&gt;Stephanie Mehta, [http://www.corning.com/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=23567 "Bend It Like Corning"], ''Fortune'', 6 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Running since 1988 at their Sullivan Park research center in [[New York (state)|New York]], Corning announced ClearCurve at a press event on 19 September 2007 and showed it publicly at the FTTH Conference later that month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/opticalfiber/news_and_events/news_releases/2007/2007091902.aspx "Corning to Introduce ClearCurve Product Suite at FTTH Conference"], Corning press release, 19 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ClearCurve, a FTTH installation can use existing armoured cabling to deliver the signal to a utility room, then connect individual ClearCurve cables to the fibers in the bundle for distribution within the building. This sort of installation dramatically simplifies the overall complexity of FTTH wiring in multi-unit dwellings, eliminating both the large coax cabling and the need to convert formats from light to electrical. Users were quickly forthcoming; announced in September, only a month later an official press release announced that Connexion Technologies would be using ClearCurve on 30 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-171924288.html "Corning Cable Systems Announces First Sale of ClearCurve Product Solution"], ''Business Wire'', 30 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many additional partners have been announced.

===Computer bus uses===
The single-mode fibers used in conversional telecommunications applications have high performance, but require expensive light sources and highly accurate mechanical positioning in order to gather light from them. In comparison, [[Multi-mode optical fiber|multi-mode]] have wider cores that are easier to connect to and can be effectively driven by lower-cost devices like solid-state IR lasers or [[vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser]]s (VCSELs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/neets/tm/106-10.htm "Mode Theory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215024923/http://www.tpub.com/neets/tm/106-10.htm |date=2009-12-15 }}, Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-mode fiber found some uses in [[high-performance computing]] applications, notably the [[Fibre Channel]] system for high speed disks and some [[parallel computing]] interconnection systems. However, the relatively inflexible cables made them less useful in general roles, where braided copper wiring remains widespread. Fiber has found one consumer use, the [[TOSLINK]] cable used in [[digital audio]] applications. This role uses lower quality multi-mode plastic fibre with limited bandwidth, about 125&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, driven by red [[LED]]s. However, advances in computers have demanded ever increasing bandwidth, and modern [[computer bus]] systems are quickly reaching their limits. There was some discussion of moving to optical fiber for the [[USB3]] standard, but the decision was made to move ahead with copper.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shankland, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9780794-1.html "USB 3.0 brings optical connection in 2008"], ''cnet'', 18 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Corning announced a multi-mode version of ClearCurve cabling on 13 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2009/2009011301.aspx "Corning Announces Multimode Version of ClearCurve Optical Fiber"], Corning press release, 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It has greater bandwidth than any common copper wiring, and is at least as flexible as copper wiring able to carry the same amount of data. Although it was mentioned only in passing, Intel's new [[Light Peak]] interconnection system uses ClearCurve cabling as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Crothers, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10363956-64.html "Sources: 'Light Peak' technology not Apple idea"], ''cnet news'', 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Light Peak uses a two-fiber cable running at 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s in both directions. Unlike most optical connection systems, Light Peak is being designed to allow daisy-chaining and supply power through a set of coaxial copper wires.

'''[[Climate change mitigation]] scenarios''' are possible futures in which [[global warming]] is reduced by deliberate actions, such as a comprehensive switch to [[alternative energy|energy sources other than fossil fuels]].  A typical mitigation scenario is constructed by selecting a long-range target, such as a desired atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and then fitting the actions to the target, for example by placing a cap on net global and national emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.

An increase of global temperature by more than 2{{nbsp}}[[°C]] has come to be the majority definition of what would constitute intolerably dangerous [[climate change]] with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels per the [[Paris Agreement]].   Some climate scientists are increasingly of the opinion that the goal should be a complete restoration of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]'s preindustrial condition, on the grounds that too protracted a [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from those conditions will produce irreversible changes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ==

{{Importance section|reason=Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are a '''target''' of mitigation, not a "mitigation scenario" or related to one.|date=March 2012}}
Contributions to climate change, whether they cool or warm the [[Earth]], are often described in terms of the [[radiative forcing]] or imbalance they introduce to the planet's [[energy budget]]. Now and in the future, [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] carbon dioxide is believed to be the major component of this forcing, and the contribution of other components is often quantified in terms of "parts-per-million CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent" ([[Parts per million|ppm]] [[CO2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e]]), or the increment/decrement in carbon dioxide concentrations which would create a radiative forcing of the same magnitude.

At present, non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributions to climate change, positive and negative, are believed to roughly cancel out, so that the net radiative forcing being experienced at present, expressed in ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e, is more or less the same as the actual current level of carbon dioxide (406.75 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as of December 2017). To some extent this legitimates the statement of targets just in terms of ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as is usually the case. However, the positive and negative non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not necessarily balance in future, and so a target stated in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e is less ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Stabilization wedges ===

A '''[[Climate stabilization wedge|stabilization wedge]]''' (or simply "wedge") is an action which incrementally reduces projected emissions. The name is derived from the triangular shape of the gap between reduced and unreduced emissions trajectories when graphed over time. For example, a reduction in electricity demand due to increased efficiency means that less electricity needs to be generated and thus fewer emissions need to be produced. The term originates in the [[Stabilization Wedge Game]]. As a reference unit, a stabilization wedge is equal to the following examples of mitigation initiatives: deployment of two million 1 MW [[Wind turbine|wind turbines]]; completely halting the [[deforestation]] and planting of 300 million hectares of trees; the increase in the average energy efficiency of all the world's buildings by 25 percent; or the installation of [[carbon capture and storage]] facilities in 800 large coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Climate Change|last=Dawson|first=Brian|last2=Spannagle|first2=Matt|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0415477891|location=Oxon|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacala and Socolow proposed in their work, ''Stabilization Wedges'', that seven wedges are required to be delivered by 2050 - at current technologies - to make a significant impact on the mitigation of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pacala|first=S.|last2=Socolow|first2=R.|date=2004-08-13|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|journal=Science|language=en|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15310891}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, sources that estimate the need for 14 wedges because Pacala and Socolow's proposal would only stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at current levels but not the atmospheric concentration, which is increasing by more than 2 ppm/year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, Socolow revised their earlier estimate to nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebulletin.org/2011/09/wedges-reaffirmed/|title=Wedges reaffirmed - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|last=Socolow|first=Robert|date=September 27, 2011|work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mitigation scenario modeled by Malte Meinshausen ''et al.'' suggested in 2006 that to stabilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 350 ppm, we would have needed to reduce emissions by slightly more than 5%  per year.&lt;ref name="multigas"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Meinshausen | first1 = M. | last2 = Hare | first2 = B. | last3 = Wigley | first3 = T.

From an "energy technology and policy perspective", [[Joe Romm]] says a 350-ppm target will require eight wedges, each saving 1 gigaton of carbon per year, by 2030, and another ten by 2060.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/2008/11/23/an-open-letter-to-james-hansen-on-the-real-truth-about-stabilizing-at-350-ppm/|title=An open letter to James Hansen on the real truth about stabilizing at 350 ppm|author=|date=|website=climateprogress.org|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern]] of the [[Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]], called the  "world’s top climate economist", endorses 350 ppm as “a very sensible long-term target.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/2009/09/09/nicholas-stern-worlds-top-climate-economist-endorses-350-ppm-long-term-target/|title=Nicholas Stern, world’s top climate economist, endorses 350 ppm as "a very sensible long-term target."|author=|date=|website=climateprogress.org|accessdate=12 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118134131/http://climateprogress.org/2009/09/09/nicholas-stern-worlds-top-climate-economist-endorses-350-ppm-long-term-target/|archive-date=2010-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeCanio]], [[Eban Goodstein]], Richard B. Howarth, [[Richard B. Norgaard]] and  Catherine S. Norman, stressing " the need for immediate, direct intervention".

[[Blue Ocean Institute]] authors Marah J.

=== 450 ppm ===

The BLUE scenarios in the IEA's [[Energy Technology Perspectives]] publication of 2008 describe pathways to a long-range concentration of 450 ppm. [[Joseph Romm]] has sketched how to achieve this target through the application of 14 wedges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateprogress.org/2008/04/22/is-450-ppm-or-less-politically-possible-part-2-the-solution/ Is 450 ppm (or less) politically possible? Part 2: The Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

''World Energy Outlook 2008'', mentioned above, also describes a "450 Policy Scenario", in which extra energy investments to 2030 amount to [[United States dollar|$]]9.3 trillion over the Reference Scenario. The scenario also features, after 2020, the participation of major economies such as [[PRC|China]] and [[India]] in a global cap-and-trade scheme initially operating in [[OECD]] and [[European Union]] countries. Also the less conservative 450 ppm scenario calls for extensive deployment of [[negative carbon dioxide emission|negative emissions]], i.e. the removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) and OECD, "Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of [[BECCS]]".&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 550 ppm ===

This is the target advocated (as an upper bound) in the [[Stern Review]]. As approximately a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels relative to [[industrial society|preindustrial]] times, it implies a temperature increase of about three degrees, according to conventional estimates of [[climate sensitivity]]. [[Mitigation of global warming#Pacala and Socolow|Pacala and Socolow]] list 15 "wedges", any 7 of which in combination should suffice to keep CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels below 550 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|first1=S.|last1=Pacala|first2=R.|last2=Socolow|date=13 August 2004|publisher=|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|accessdate=12 April 2018|via=www.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|pmid=15310891|bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]]'s [[World Energy Outlook]] report for 2008 describes a "Reference Scenario" for the world's energy future "which assumes no new government policies beyond those already adopted by mid-2008", and then a "550 Policy Scenario" in which further policies are adopted, a mixture of "[[cap-and-trade]] systems,  [[economic sector|sectoral]] agreements and national measures". In the Reference Scenario, between 2006 and 2030 the world invests $26.3 trillion in energy-supply infrastructure; in the 550 Policy Scenario, a further $4.1 trillion is spent in this period, mostly on [[efficient energy use|efficiency]] increases which deliver fuel cost savings of over $7 trillion.&lt;ref name="weo08"&gt;http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2008/fact_sheets_08.pdf [[World Energy Outlook]] 2008 Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other greenhouse gases ==

Greenhouse gas concentrations are aggregated in terms of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent#Equivalent carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide equivalent]]. Some multi-gas mitigation scenarios have been modeled by Meinshausen ''et al.''&lt;ref name="multigas" /&gt;

=== As a short-term focus ===

In a 2000 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first2=Makiko|last2=Sato|first3=Reto|last3=Ruedy|first4=Andrew|last4=Lacis|first5=Valdar|last5=Oinas|date=29 August 2000|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=97|issue=18|pages=9875–9880|bibcode=2000PNAS...97.9875H|doi=10.1073/pnas.170278997|doi-access=free|pmc=27611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen argued that the 0.75{{nbsp}}°C{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} rise in average global temperatures over the last 100 years has been driven mainly by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, since warming due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; had been offset by cooling due to [[aerosols]], implying the viability of a strategy initially based around reducing emissions of non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases and of [[black carbon]], focusing on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only in the longer run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsusa.wsm.ga3.org/ssi/archive/ucs-review-for-alternative-scenario.html Review of Hansen et al.: Global Warming in the Twenty-First Century: An Alternative Scenario]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also argued by [[Veerabhadran Ramanathan]] and Jessica Seddon Wallack the September/October 2009 [[Foreign Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65238/jessica-seddon-wallack-and-veerabhadran-ramanathan/the-other-climate-changers Why Black Carbon and Ozone Also Matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks without background.svg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
'''Drama''' is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]]: a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[mime]], [[ballet]], etc, performed in a [[theatre]], or on [[Radio drama|radio]] or television.&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term "drama" comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δρᾶμα}}, ''drama''), which is derived from "I do" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δράω}}, ''drao''). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional [[Genre|generic]] division between [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. 

In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word "[[Play (theatre)|play]]" or "game" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''pleġan'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used to describe drama until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist" and the building was a "play-house" rather than a "[[Theater (building)|theatre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a "maker" rather than a "writer" is preserved in the word "[[playwright]]." [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was "a self-conscious latinism to describe one particular playhouse" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' "was at that time still unknown in the English language" (1981, 68).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[play (theatre)|play]] dates from the modern era. "Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). It is this narrower sense that the [[film]] and [[television]] industries, along with [[film studies]], adopted to describe "[[Drama (film and television)|drama]]" as a [[Film genre|genre]] within their respective media. "[[Radio drama]]" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 894–900).&lt;/ref&gt;

The enactment of drama in [[theatre]], performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with [[music]]: the dramatic text in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musical theatre|Musicals]] include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Closet drama]] describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], for example, is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entry on "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of 'lazzi' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the USA; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Western drama==
===Classical Greek drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century BC – early 1st century AD, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]
[[Western culture|Western]] drama originates in [[classical Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), and Ley (2007, 206). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented [[theatre]]" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatrical culture]] of the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] produced three [[genre]]s of drama: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]]. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were [[institution]]alised in [[Agon|competitions]] held as part of [[Athenian festivals|festivities]] celebrating the god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Banham (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least [[Thespis]], who is credited with the innovation of an actor ("''hypokrites''") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a [[Character (arts)|character]] (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and its leader ("''[[coryphaeus]]''"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry ([[dithyramb]]ic, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 441–444). For more information on these ancient Greek dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], and the comic writers [[Aristophanes]] and, from the late 4th century, [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] would bring this number to six dramatists whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus' historical tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 8) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ("''[[agon]]''") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records ("''didaskaliai''") begin from 501 BC when the [[satyr play]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Banham (1998, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; Tragic dramatists were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC). [[Comedy]] was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.

Five comic dramatists competed at the City [[Dionysia]] (though during the [[Peloponnesian War]] this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 18) and Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is traditionally divided between "old comedy" (5th century BC), "middle comedy" (4th century BC) and "new comedy" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Roman drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Statuette actor Petit Palais ADUT00192.jpg|thumb|An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of [[tragedy]], 1st century CE.]]
Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; [[Theater of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48" /&gt; No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50" /&gt;

[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stage drawing from a 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
Beginning in the [[early Middle Ages]], churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as [[liturgical drama]]s, to enliven annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76, 78). Many churches would have only performed one or two [[liturgical drama]]s per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example is the [[Easter]] trope ''Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)'' (c. 925).&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups would sing responsively in [[Latin]], though no impersonation of [[Character (arts)|characters]] was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Italy]]; excluding [[Al-Andalus|Islamic-era Spain]].

In the 10th century, [[Hrosvitha]] wrote six plays in Latin modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies, but which treated religious subjects.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; Later, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] wrote a [[music]]al drama, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (c. 1155).&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt;

One of the most famous of the early [[Secularity|secular]] plays is the courtly [[pastoral]] ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Robin and Marion]]'', written in the 13th century in French by [[Adam de la Halle]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 191; 1987, 141).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French [[farce]]s, such as ''[[The Boy and the Blind Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 9, 11, 38, 45), Dillon (2006, 213), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190). In ''Early English Stages'' (1981), Wickham points to the existence of ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' as evidence that the old-fashioned view that [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] began in England in the 1550s with ''[[Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' and ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of [[Medieval theatre|medieval comic drama]]; see Wickham (1981, 178).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in the [[late Middle Ages]], when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; In England, trade guilds began to perform [[vernacular]] "[[mystery plays]]," which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or "pageants," of which four are [[Extant literature|extant]]: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and the so-called "[[N-Town Plays|N-Town]]" (42). ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its [[protagonist]], Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the [[Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality plays]] (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early [[Elizabethan era]] in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. ''[[Everyman]]'', for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience.  ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. ''[[Horestes]]'' (c. 1567), a late "hybrid morality" and one of the earliest examples of an English [[revenge play]], brings together the classical story of [[Orestes]] with a [[Vice (character)|Vice]] from the medieval [[Allegory|allegorical]] tradition, alternating comic, [[slapstick]] scenes with serious, [[Tragedy|tragic]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack (1958, 251-303), Bevington (1962, 58-61, 81-82, 87, 183), and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the [[Mummers Play]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season. Court [[masque]]s were particularly popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabethan and Jacobean===
{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
One of the great flowerings of drama in [[England]] occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly [[iambic pentameter]]. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Middleton]], and [[Ben Jonson]] were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]] or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

===English Restoration comedy===
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
[[File:Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh engraving.jpg|thumb|[[Colley Cibber]] as the extravagant and affected Lord Foppington, "brutal, evil, and smart", in [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh's]] ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696).]]

[[Restoration comedy]] refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After [[London theatre closure 1642|public theatre had been banned]] by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatch|first1=Mary Jo|title=The Three Faces of Leadership: Manager, Artist, Priest|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration comedy is known for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan [[wit]], up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]], in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]] (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675), whose title contains a [[Lascivious behavior|lewd]] [[pun]] and whose notorious "china scene" is a series of sustained [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|ROI9FhR6URI|The "China scene" from Wycherley's play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous "Proviso" scene. Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected [[burlesque]] [[fop]] with a dark side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did.&lt;ref&gt;Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.&lt;/ref&gt; At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by [[sentimental comedy]] and the drama of exemplary morality.

===Modern and postmodern===
The pivotal and innovative contributions of the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century]] Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century]] German [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1993, 25–26) and Moi (2006, 17). Moi writes that "Ibsen is the most important playwright writing after Shakespeare. He is the founder of modern theater. His plays are world classics, staged on every continent, and studied in classrooms everywhere. In any given year, there are hundreds of Ibsen productions in the world." Ibsenites include [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Arthur Miller]]; Brechtians include [[Dario Fo]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[W. H. Auden]] [[Peter Weiss]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[John Arden]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Edward Bond]], and [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].&lt;/ref&gt; The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realist]], incorporating formal [[Experimental theatre|experimentation]], [[meta-theatre|meta-theatricality]], and [[Social criticism|social critique]].&lt;ref&gt;Moi (2006, 1, 23–26). Taxidou writes: "It is probably historically more accurate, although methodologically less satisfactory, to read the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist movement in the theatre]] in conjunction with the more anti-illusionist aesthetics of the theatres of the same period. These interlock and overlap in all sorts of complicated ways, even when they are vehemently denouncing each other (perhaps particularly when) in the favoured mode of the time, the manifesto" (2007, 58).&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of "[[Tragedy#Modern development|liberal tragedy]]", while Brecht's has been aligned with an [[Historicization|historicised]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966) and Wright (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

== Opera ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
[[Opera|Western opera]] is a dramatic art form that arose during the [[Renaissance]] in an attempt to revive the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|classical Greek drama]] in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with [[Classical music|western classical music]], the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer [[Wagner|Richard Wagner]] on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called "[[music drama]]s".

[[Chinese opera]] has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.

== Pantomime ==
{{Main|Pantomime}}
[[Pantomime]] (informally '''panto'''),&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

These stories follow in the tradition of [[fable]]s and [[Folklore|folk tale]]s. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses [[stock character]]s seen in masque and again [[commedia dell'arte]], these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on [[moral dilemma]]s, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Britain the word "pantomime" is usually used to mean '''[[Mime artist|miming]]''', rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mime==
[[Mime artist|Mime]] is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in [[Ancient Greece]], and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although their performances were not necessarily silent.&lt;ref&gt;Gutzwiller (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medieval]] Europe, early forms of mime, such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s, evolved. In the early nineteenth century [[Paris]], [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. [[Étienne Decroux]], a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]]. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;Callery (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet==
While some ballet emphasises "the lines and patterns of movement itself" dramatic dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and "tell a story",&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Dance movements in ballet "are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', based on Shakespeare's famous play, and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.

== Creative drama ==
Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. [[Winifred Ward]] is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich (1974, 75–80).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]
The earliest form of [[India]]n drama was the [[Sanskrit drama]].&lt;ref name="RSZ12"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1998, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanskrit theatre====
{{Main|Sanskrit drama}}
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"&gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"&gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], architecture, [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include [[Bhasa]], [[Kalidasa]] (famous for ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam|Vikrama and Urvashi]]'', ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram|Malavika and Agnimitra]]'', and ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|The Recognition of Shakuntala]]''), [[Śudraka]] (famous for ''[[Mṛcchakatika|The Little Clay Cart]]''), [[Asvaghosa]], [[Daṇḍin]], and [[Harsha|Emperor Harsha]] (famous for ''[[Nagananda]]'', ''[[Ratnavali]],'' and ''[[Priyadarsika]]''). ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"/&gt;

====Modern Indian drama====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham1051"&gt;Banham (1998, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham1051"/&gt;
[[Girish Karnad]] is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as ''Tughlaq'', ''Hayavadana'', ''[[Taledanda]]'', and ''Naga-Mandala'' are significant contributions to Indian drama. [[Vijay Tendulkar]] and [[Mahesh Dattani]] are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and [[Danish Iqbal]] in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's ''Dara Shikoh'' are considered modern classics.

====Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like [[Nawab Wajid Ali Shah]] (1822 – 1887) of [[Awadh]]. His dramatic experiments led to the famous [[Inder Sabha]] of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.

Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern [[Indian theatre]]. Theatre has flourished in [[Urdu]] (which was called [[Hindi]] by early writers), along with [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Urdu drama has had an important influence on [[Hindi film industry|Bombay Film industry]] and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.

Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few [[postmodern]] playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. ''Maulana Azad'' is his most important play both for its content and style.

Danish Iqbal's play ''[[Dara Shikoh]]'' directed by [[M. S. Sathyu]] is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are ''[[Sahir]]''. on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. ''Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam'' is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Faiz]]'s poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. ''Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan'' – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy]] days. He has written 14 other plays including ''Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa'' and ''Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon''. Shahid's ''Three B'' is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in [[Kolkata]]. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of [[Mumbai]] has written several plays in Urdu, his play ''AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?'' won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.

===China===
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}
[[File:1958 CPA 2262.jpg|thumb|A 1958 [[U.S.S.R.]] [[postage stamp]] commemorating [[Guan Hanqing]], one of the great Chinese dramatists, who is renowned for his "[[zaju]]" plays.]]

Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called [[Chinese opera]] although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as [[Beijing opera]] and [[Kunqu]]; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as [[zaju]].

===Japan===
{{Main article|Theatre of Japan}}
Japanese [[Noh|Nō drama]] is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715090014/http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archivedate=2005-07-15| accessdate=2013-02-27| deadurl=yes| title=Background to Noh-Kyogen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyōgen]] is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. [[Kabuki]] drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.

'''Ekphonetic notation''' consists of symbols added to certain sacred texts, especially [[lectionary]] readings of Biblical texts, as a [[mnemonic]] device to assist in their [[cantillation]].  Ekphonetic notation can take a number of forms, and has been used in several [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] [[plainchant]] traditions, but is most commonly associated with [[Byzantine chant]].  In many cases, the original meaning of ekphonetic [[neume]]s is obscure, and must be reconstructed by comparison with later notation.

===UK===
The number of cases of [[human trafficking]] involving [[forced labour]] has increased to 42% in England and Wales, a 2011 study from [[The Salvation Army]] reported.&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Human Trafficking for Forced Labour Overtakes Sexual Exploitation for First Time in UK|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/human-trafficking-forced-labour-overtakes-sexual-exploitation-first-time-uk-1469810|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=International Business Times|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Karen Bradley]], the minister for modern slavery and organised crime, "there are more people in slavery today than at any other time in human history."&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking" /&gt; Over 80% of the cases of forced labour involved men, with the majority of victims contacting the charity from parts of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking" /&gt; Bradley said the move towards eliminating modern slavery would include a [[Modern Slavery Act 2015|modern slavery bill]] going to Parliament, placing a weighty responsibility on large companies to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery.&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking" /&gt;

'''Eye movement in reading''' involves the [[visual processing]] of written text. This was described by the French [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Louis Émile Javal]] in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements ([[saccade]]s) intermingled with short stops ([[Fixation (visual)|fixations]]). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of [[eye movement]] in the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of [[human behaviour]] and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record, and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of [[cognitive psychology]] as a theoretical and methodological framework within which [[reading (process)|reading]] processes are examined. Sereno &amp; Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through recordings of eye movement and [[event-related potential]].

== History ==

Until the second half of the 19th century, researchers had at their disposal three methods of investigating eye movement. The first, unaided observation, yielded only small amounts of data that would be considered unreliable by today's scientific standards. This lack of reliability arises from the fact that eye movement occurs frequently, rapidly, and over small angles, to the extent that it is impossible for an experimenter to [[perceive]] and record the data fully and accurately without technological assistance. The other method was [[self-observation]], now considered to be of doubtful status in a scientific context. Despite this, some knowledge appears to have been produced from [[introspection]] and naked-eye observation. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham|Ibn al Haytham]], a medical man in 11th-century Egypt, is reported to have written of reading in terms of a series of quick movements and to have realised that readers use [[peripheral vision|peripheral]] as well as [[Fovea centralis|central vision]].&lt;ref&gt;Heller (1988:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eye Line of sight.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo da Vinci: The eye has a central line and everything that reaches the eye through this central line can be seen distinctly.]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) may have been the first in Europe to recognize certain special optical qualities of the eye. He derived his insights partly through introspection but mainly through a process that could be described as optical modelling. Based on dissection of the human eye he made experiments with water-filled crystal balls. He wrote "The function of the human eye, ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. But I found it to be completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo da Vinci (1955), das Lebensbild eines Genies, Emil Vollmer Verlag, Wiesbaden Berlin. Dokumentation der Davinci Ausstellung in Mailand 1938, p. 430; cited in 'Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude'  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the "line-of-sight", the optical line that ends at the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal vision (a more precise term for central vision) and [[peripheral vision]]. However, Leonardo did not know that the retina is the sensible layer, he still believed that the lens is the organ of vision.

There appear to be no records of eye movement research until the early 19th century. At first, the chief concern was to describe the eye as a [[physiological]] and mechanical moving object, the most serious attempt being [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s major work ''Handbook of physiological optics'' (1866). The physiological approach was gradually superseded by interest in the [[psychological]] aspects of visual input, in eye movement as a functional component of visual tasks.

The subsequent decades saw more elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including a claim that meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Pollatsek, &amp; Alexander (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the French [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Louis Émile Javal]] used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term [[saccade]]s. In 1898, Erdmann &amp; Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.

=== Early tracking technology ===

[[Eye tracking device]] is a tool created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of [[electromagnetic energy]] was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare was the first to use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamare |first1=M. |title=Des mouvements des yeux pendants la lecture |journal=Comptes rendus de la société française d'ophthalmologie |date=1893 |pages=35–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Edmund B. Delabarre]] invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a [[stylus]] with a direct mechanical connection to the [[cornea]].&lt;ref&gt;Delabarre (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used from the end of the 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps.

Mechanical systems suffered three serious disadvantages: questionable accuracy due to slippage of the physical connection, the considerable discomfort caused to participants by the direct mechanical connection (and consequently great difficulty in persuading people to participate), and issues of [[ecological validity]], since participants' experience of reading in trials was significantly different from the normal reading experience. Despite these drawbacks, mechanical devices were used in eye movement research well into the 20th century.

Attempts were soon made to overcome these problems. One solution was to use electromagnetic energy rather than a mechanical connection. In the "Dodge technique", a beam of light was directed at the cornea, focused by a system of lenses and then recorded on a moveable photographic plate. Erdmann &amp; Dodge&lt;ref&gt;Erdmann B &amp; Dodge R (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; used this technique to claim that there is little or no perception during saccades, a finding that was later confirmed by Utall &amp; Smith using more sophisticated equipment. The photographic plate in the Dodge technique was soon replaced with a film camera, but was still plagued by problems of accuracy, due to the difficulty of keeping all parts of the equipment perfectly aligned throughout a trial and accurately compensating for the distortion caused by the diffractive qualities of photographic lenses. In addition, it was usually necessary to restrain a participant's head by using an uncomfortable bite-bar or head-clamp.

In 1922, Schott pioneered a further advance called [[electro-oculography]] (EOG), a method of recording the electrical potential between the cornea and the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;Schott E (1922).&lt;/ref&gt; Electrodes may be covered with special contact paste before being placed on the skin. So, it is now unnecessary to make incisions in patient's skin. Common misconception about EOG is that measured potential is the electromyogram of [[extraocular muscles]]. In fact, it is only the projection of eye dipole to the skin, because higher frequencies, corresponding to EMG, are filtered out. EOG delivered considerable improvements in accuracy and reliability, which explain its continued use by experimentalists for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Preston, &amp; Fuchs (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Zhou, Hu (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tecce, Pok, Consiglio, O'Neil (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern eye tracking ==

Four major cognitive systems are involved in eye movement during reading: language processing, attention, vision, and oculomotor control.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~perfetti/Eye%20Movements%20During%20Reading.htm |title=Eye Movements During Reading |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eye trackers bounce near [[infrared]] light off the interior of the eyeball, and monitor the reflection on the eye to determine gaze location. With this technique, the position of a fixation on a screen can be precisely determined.&lt;ref&gt;wang (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Wang (2011) mentioned that a video-based eye-tracker which uses video cameras to record the eye position of human subjects—recording pupil dilation and eye movement—can be used to examine how fixations, saccades, and pupil dilation responses are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices. According to Wang (2011:185), "understanding the relationship between these observables can help us to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in. This is because fixations and saccades (matched with information shown on screen) indicate how people acquire information (and what they see), time lengths of fixations indicate attention, and pupil dilation responses indicate emotion, arousal, stress, pain, or cognitive load." {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--not thrilled with the strict categories Wang implies--&gt;

== Saccades ==

[[Image:Reading VOG hor.gif|thumb|right|Horizontal eye movement in reading. Left-to-right movement may be seen as "upstairs", and right-to-left saccades are clear.]]
Skilled readers move their eyes during reading on the average of every quarter of a second. During the time that the eye is fixated, new information is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200–250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms.&lt;ref&gt;Sereno &amp; Rayner (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, &amp; Seidenberg (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Slattery, Belanger (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but only recently have researchers begun to look at eye movement behavior as a reflection of [[cognitive processing]] during reading.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner K (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EyeFixationsReading.gif|frame|center|A diagram demonstrating the [[Visual acuity|acuity]] of foveal vision in reading]]
The lower line of text simulates the acuity of vision with the relative acuity percentages. The difficulty of recognizing text increases with the distance from the fixation point.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dyslexia ==
People with [[dyslexia]] generally suffer from a decreased reading speed, which can be caused by many different variables. There are many remedies to try and combat these deficits, depending on what [[Biological theories of dyslexia|biological theory of dyslexia]] they are based on. One such idea is based on magnocellular deficit, where [[magnocellular pathway]]s are uncoordinated, causing the skipping or re-reading of lines.&lt;ref&gt;Stein J., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11305228 The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia] Dyslexia. 2001 Jan–Mar;7(1):12–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer models of eye movement in reading ===
Competition–interaction theory and SERIF emphasise low level oculomotor processes in reading such as how the word length of the currently fixated word and its neighbour words affect saccade amplitude and latency (or fixation duration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(01)00025-6|title=Eye movements during reading: A theory of saccade initiation times|journal=Vision Research|volume=41|issue=25–26|pages=3567–3585|year=2001|last1=Yang|first1=S.-N|last2=McConkie|first2=G.W}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Current reference is only for competition-interaction theory}} Reader, EMMA, E-Z Reader and SWIFT emphasise higher level cognitive processes such as lexical processing, word frequency, word parsing or word predictability.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">{{English Feudalism}}

In the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the European [[Feudalism|feudal system]], '''feoffment''' or '''enfeoffment''' was the deed by which a person was given land in exchange for a pledge of service. This mechanism was later used to avoid restrictions on the passage of title in land by a system in which a landowner would give land to one person for the use of another. The [[common law]] of [[estates in land]] grew from this concept.

==England==
In English law, feoffment was a transfer of land or property that gave the new holder the right to sell it as well as the right to pass it on to his heirs as an inheritance. It was total relinquishment and transfer of all rights of ownership of an [[estate in land]] from one individual to another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/6844/Feoffment.html|title=Feoffment|author=|date=|website=law.jrank.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In feudal England a feoffment could only be made of a [[fee (feudal tenure)|fee]] (or "fief"), which is an [[estate in land]], that is to say an ownership of rights over land, rather than ownership of the land itself, the only true owner of which was the monarch under his [[allodial title]]. Enfeoffment could be made of fees of various [[Feudal land tenure|feudal tenures]], such as [[Entail|fee-tail]] or [[fee-simple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Feoffment |volume=10|pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] or delivery of possession, known as [[livery of seisin]] was effected generally on the site of the land in a symbolic ceremony called "feoffment with livery of seisin." In the ceremony, the parties would typically go to the land with witnesses "and the transferor would then hand to the transferee a lump of soil or a twig from a tree -- all the while intoning the appropriate words of grant, together with the magical words 'and his heirs' if the interest transferred was to be a potentially infinite one."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Bergin &amp; Paul G. Haskell, ''Preface to Estates in Land and Future Interests'', p. 11, Foundation Press (2d ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Written conveyances were customary and mandatory after 1677.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204343/feoffment|title=Feoffment - English law|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feoffee was thenceforward said to hold his property "of" or "from" the feoffor, in return for a specified service depending on the exact form of [[feudal land tenure]] involved in the feoffment. Thus for every holding of land during the [[Feudalism in England|feudal era]] there existed an historical unbroken chain of feoffees, in the form of [[Lord|overlords]], ultimately springing from feoffments made by [[William the Conqueror]] himself in 1066 as the highest overlord of all.

This pattern of land-holding was the natural product of William the Conqueror claiming an allodial title to all the land of England following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 and parcelling it out as large [[fee (feudal tenure)|fees]] in the form of [[English feudal barony|feudal baronies]] to his followers, who then in turn subinfeudated the lands comprising their baronies into [[manor]]s to be held from them by their own followers and knights.

When the new feoffee [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] another person from his holding, for example where he created a new [[manor]], he would become overlord to the person so enfeoffed, and a [[mesne lord]] within the longer historical chain of title. In modern English land law the theory of such long historical chain of title still exists for every holding in [[fee simple]], although for practical purposes it is not necessary at the time of conveyance to recite the descent of the fee from its creation.

{{anthropology of religion|Basic}}
A '''fetish''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] ''fétiche''; which comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''feitiço''; and this in turn from [[Latin]] ''facticius'', "artificial" and ''facere'', "to make") is an object believed to have [[supernatural]] powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the [[emic]] attribution of inherent value or powers to an object.

==Historiography==
The term "fetish" has evolved from an idiom used to describe a type of objects created in the interaction between European travelers and Africans in the early modern period to an analytical term that played a central role in the perception and study of non-Western art in general and African art in particular.

William Pietz, who conducted an extensive ethno-historical study of the fetish, argues that the term originated in the coast of [[West Africa]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Pietz distinguishes between, on the one hand, actual African objects that may be called fetishes in Europe, together with the indigenous theories of them, and on the other hand, "fetish", an idea, and an idea of a kind of object, to which the term above applies.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGaffey|first=Wyatt|title=African objects and the idea of fetish|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1994|volume=25|pages=123–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pietz, the [[post-colonial]] concept of "fetish" emerged from the encounter between Europeans and Africans in a very specific historical context and in response to African material culture.

He begins his polemic with an introduction to the complex history of the word:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My argument, then, is that the fetish could originate only in conjunction with the emergent articulation of the ideology of the commodity form that defined itself within and against the social values and religious ideologies of two radically different types of noncapitalist society, as they encountered each other in an ongoing cross-cultural situation. This process is indicated in the history of the word itself as it developed from the late medieval Portuguese ''feitiço'', to the sixteenth-century pidgin ''Fetisso'' on the African coast, to various northern European versions of the word via the 1602 text of the Dutchman Pieter de Marees... The fetish, then, not only originated from, but remains specific to, the problem of the social value of material objects as revealed in situations formed by the encounter of radically heterogeneous social systems, and a study of the history of the idea of the fetish may be guided by identifying those themes that persist throughout the various discourses and disciplines that have appropriated the term.&lt;ref name="Pietz 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietz|first=William|title=The Problem of the Fetish, I|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1985|volume=9|pages=5–17|jstor=20166719|publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College acting through the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stallybrass concludes that "Pietz shows that the fetish as a concept was elaborated to demonize the supposedly arbitrary attachment of West Africans to material objects. The European subject was constituted in opposition to a demonized fetishism, through the disavowal of the object."&lt;ref name="Stallybrass 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stallybrass|first=Peter|title=Consumption : critical concepts in the social sciences|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415242673|edition=1. publ.|authorlink=Marx's Coat|editor=Daniel Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] developed the concept of the fetish to refer to the objects used in religious cults by West African natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Open University|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=August 2016}} The contemporary Portuguese ''feitiço'' may refer to more neutral terms such as charm, enchantment, juju or abracadabra, or more potentially offensive terms such as witchcraft, witchery, conjuration or bewitchment.

The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when [[Charles de Brosses]] used it in comparing [[West Africa]]n religion to the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al aspects of [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Later, [[Auguste Comte]] employed the concept in his theory of the [[evolution theory|evolution]] of [[religion]], wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by [[polytheism]] and [[monotheism]]. However, [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]] would classify some artifacts of monotheistic religions as fetishes. For example, the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and the [[Sacramental bread|consecrated host]] or tokens of communion found in some forms of [[Christianity]] (a monotheistic religion), are here regarded as examples of fetishism.

The eighteenth-century intellectuals who articulated the theory of fetishism encountered this notion in descriptions of "Guinea" contained in such popular voyage collections as Ramusio's ''Viaggio e Navigazioni'' (1550), de Bry's ''India Orientalis'' (1597), Purchas's ''Hakluytus Posthumus'' (1625), [[Awnsham Churchill|Churchill]]'s ''Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1732), [[Thomas Astley|Astley]]'s ''A New General Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1746), and Prevost's ''Histoire generale des voyages'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Pietz 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietz|first=William|title=The Problem of the Fetish, II: The Origin of the Fetish|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1987|volume=13|pages=23–45|jstor=20166762|publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College acting through the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of fetishism was consecrated at the end of the eighteenth century by [[G.W.F Hegel]] in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]''. According to Hegel, Africans were incapable of abstract thought, their ideas and actions were governed by impulse, and therefore a fetish object could be anything that then was arbitrarily imbued with imaginary powers.&lt;ref name=Astonishment&amp;Power&gt;{{cite book|last=MacGaffey|first=Wyatt|title=Astonishment &amp; Power, The Eyes of Understanding: Kongo Minkisi|year=1993|publisher=National Museum of African Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Tylor and McLennan, historians of religion, held that the concept of fetishism fostered a shift of attention away from the relationship between people and [[God]], to focus instead on a relationship between people and material objects, and that this, in turn, allowed for the establishment of false models of [[causality]] for natural events. This they saw as a central problem historically and sociologically.

In 1927, [[Sigmund Freud]] published his essay on "Fetishism", in which he writes that the meaning and purpose of the fetish turns out, through analysis, to always be the same: "the fetish is a substitute for the penis...for a particular and quite special penis that had been extremely important in early childhood but had later been lost." In refusing to see his mother's lack of penis, the boy [[Denial|disavows]] (German: ''Verleugnung'', not repression: ''Verdrängung'') what he sees, resulting in both a belief and a non-belief in the woman's phallus. This compromise (produced by the conflict between perception and the counter-wish) results in a substitute (the fetish). "It remains a token of triumph over the threat of castration and a protection against it."

==Practice==
[[File:Voodo-fetischmarkt-Lomé.jpg|thumb|300px|A voodoo fetish market in [[Lomé]], [[Togo]], 2008]]
The use of the concept in the study of religion derives from studies of traditional [[West Africa]]n religious beliefs, as well as from [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]], which in turn derives from those beliefs.

Fetishes were commonly used in [[Native American religion]] and practices.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;"Animals: fact and folklore," ''[[New Mexico Magazine]]'', August 2008, pp. 56-63, see [http://www.nmmagazine.com/ New Mexico magazine website].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bear]] represented the [[shaman]], the [[American Bison|buffalo]] was the provider, the [[mountain lion]] was the warrior, and the [[wolf]] was the pathfinder.&lt;ref name=NM /&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}

==''Minkisi''==
Made and used by the [[Kongo people|BaKongo]] people of western [[Zaire]], a ''[[nkisi]]'' (plural ''minkisi'') is a sculptural object that provides a local habitation for a spiritual personality. Though some minkisi have always been anthropomorphic, they were probably much less naturalistic or "realistic" before the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century; Kongo figures are more naturalistic in the coastal areas than inland.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt; As Europeans tend to think of spirits as objects of worship, idols become the objects of idolatry when worship was addressed to false gods. In this way, Europeans regarded ''minkisi'' as idols on the basis of false assumptions.

Europeans often called nkisi "fetishes" and sometimes "[[Cult image|idols]]" because they are sometimes rendered in human form. Modern anthropology has generally referred to these objects either as "power objects" or as "charms".

In addressing the question of whether a ''nkisi'' is a fetish, William McGaffey writes that the Kongo ritual system as a whole,

&lt;blockquote&gt;bears a relationship similar to that which Marx supposed that "political economy" bore to capitalism as its "religion", but not for the reasons advanced by Bosman, the Enlightenment thinkers, and Hegel. The irrationally "animate" character of the ritual system's symbolic apparatus, including ''minkisi'', divination devices, and witch-testing ordeals, obliquely expressed real relations of power among the participants in ritual. "Fetishism" is about relations among people, rather than the objects that mediate and disguise those relations.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, McGaffey concludes, to call a ''minkisi'' a fetish is to translate "certain Kongo realities into the categories developed in the emergent social sciences of nineteenth century, post-enlightenment Europe."&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt;

==Secular fetishism==
The 19th century saw the introduction of two theories of fetishism outside what was typically considered religion. The first was [[Karl Marx]]'s idea of [[commodity fetishism]], in which the social relationships involved in production are experienced not as relationships among people, but as value-relationships between things (commodities – including labour – and money). The second was [[Alfred Binet]]'s term [[sexual fetishism]], the sexual attachment to an object in place of a person.

In [[management]] literature, '''gap analysis''' involves the comparison of actual performance with potential or desired performance{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. If an organization does not make the best use of current resources, or forgoes investment in [[Capital (economics)|capital]] or technology, it may produce or perform below an idealized potential. This concept is similar to an economy's production being below the [[production possibilities frontier]].

Gap analysis identifies gaps between the [[operations research|optimized]] [[Resource allocation|allocation]] and integration of the inputs (resources), and the current allocation-level. This may reveal areas that can be improved. Gap analysis involves determining, documenting, and improving the difference between business requirements and current capabilities. Gap analysis naturally flows from [[benchmarking]] and from other assessments. Once the general expectation of performance in an industry is understood, it is possible to compare that expectation with the company's current level of performance. This comparison becomes the gap analysis.  Such analysis can be performed at the strategic or at the operational level of an organization.

Gap analysis is a formal study of what a [[business]] is doing currently and where it wants to go in the future.  It can be conducted, in different perspectives, as follows:
# [[Organization]] (e.g., Human Resources)
# Business direction
# [[Business process]]es
# [[Information technology]]

Gap analysis provides a foundation for measuring investment of time, money and human resources required to achieve a particular outcome (e.g. to turn the salary payment process from paper-based to paperless with the use of a system). Note that "GAP analysis" has also been used{{by whom?|date=June 2015}} as a means of classifying how well a product or solution meets a targeted need or set of requirements. In this case, "GAP" can be used as a ranking of "Good", "Average" or "Poor". (This terminology appears in the [[PRINCE2]] project management publication from the [[Office of Government Commerce|OGC (Office of Government Commerce)]].)
  
The need for new products or additions to existing lines may emerge from portfolio analysis, in particular from the use of the Boston Consulting Group [[Growth-share matrix]]&amp;mdash;or the need may emerge from the regular process of following trends in the requirements of consumers. At some point, a gap emerges between what existing products offer and what the consumer demands. The organization must fill that gap to survive and grow.
  
Gap analysis can identify gaps in the market. Thus, comparing forecast profits to desired profits reveals the ''planning gap''. This represents a goal for new activities in general, and new products in particular.  
The planning gap can be divided into three main elements:{{huh?|date=June 2015}}

==Usage gap==
The usage gap is the gap between the total potential for the market and actual current usage by all consumers in the market. Data for this calculation includes:
* Market usage
* Existing usage

==Existing usage==
Existing consumer usage makes up the total current market, from which market shares, for example, are calculated. It usually derives from marketing research, most accurately from panel research, but also from adhoc work. Sometimes it may be available from figures that governments or industries have collected. However, these are often based on categories that make bureaucratic sense but are less helpful in marketing terms. The ''''usage gap'''' is thus:  
: usage gap = market potential – existing usage 
  
This is an important calculation. Many, if not most, marketers accept existing market size&amp;mdash;suitably projected their forecast timescales&amp;mdash;as the boundary for expansion plans. Though this is often the most realistic assumption, it may impose an unnecessary limit on horizons. For example: the original market for video-recorders was limited to professional users who could afford high prices. Only after some time did the technology extend to the mass market.
  
In the public sector, where service providers usually enjoy a monopoly, the usage gap is probably the most important factor in activity development. However, persuading more consumers to take up family benefits, for example, is probably more important to the relevant government department than opening more local offices.
  
Usage gap is most important for brand leaders. If a company has a significant share of the whole market, they may find it worthwhile to invest in making the market bigger. This option is not generally open to minor players, though they may still profit by targeting specific offerings as market extensions.
  
All other gaps relate to the difference between existing sales (market share) and total sales of the market as a whole. The difference is the competitor share. These gaps therefore, relate to competitive activity.

==Product gap==
The ''product gap''—also called the ''segment'' or ''positioning gap''—is that part of the market a particular organization is excluded from because of product or service characteristics. This may be because the market is segmented and the organization does not have offerings in some segments, or because the organization positions its offerings in a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings are much better placed for these consumers.
  
This segmentation may result from deliberate policy. Segmentation and positioning are powerful marketing techniques, but the trade-off—against better focus—is that market segments may effectively be put beyond reach. On the other hand, product gap can occur by default; the organization has thought out its positioning, its offerings drifted to a particular market segment.
  
The product gap may be the main element of the planning gap where an organization can have productive input; hence the emphasis on the importance of correct positioning.

==Use to develop a better process==
A gap analysis can also be used to analyze gaps in processes and the gulf between the existing outcome and the desired outcome.
This step process can be illustrated by the example below:
* Identify the existing process: fishing by using fishing rods
* Identify the existing outcome: we can manage to catch 20 fish per day
* Identify the desired outcome: we want to catch 100 fish per day
* Identify and document the gap: it is a difference of 80 fish
* Identify the process to achieve the desired outcome: we can use an alternative method such as using a fishing net
* Develop the means to fill the gap: acquire and use a fishing net
* Develop and prioritize Requirements to bridge the gap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clients.criticalimpact.com/go.cfm?a=1&amp;b=190498&amp;c=24428&amp;f=7027524de51ceed3ef5797149eaa845b522d9f0eaa681b4f |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120053323/http://clients.criticalimpact.com/go.cfm?a=1&amp;b=190498&amp;c=24428&amp;f=7027524de51ceed3ef5797149eaa845b522d9f0eaa681b4f |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-20 |title=Business Analyst &amp;#124; Do We Need a Mature GAP Analysis? |website=Clients.criticalimpact.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gap analysis can also be used to compare one process to others performed elsewhere, which are often identified through benchmarking. In this usage, one compares each process side-by-side and step-by-step and then notes the differences. One then analyzes each deviation to determine if there is any benefit to changing to the alternate process. The results of this analysis (in the context of the benefits and detriments of changing processes) may support the maintenance of the current process, the wholesale adoption of an alternate process, or a fusion of different aspects of each process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N.

(Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

In 2013, [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] included the technology into their "Technology Roadmap";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = IATA Technology Roadmap|last = |first = |publisher = IATA|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 25|edition = 4th|url = http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/technology-roadmap-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Airbus]] pursues the concept as part of its "Future by Airbus” strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aircraft.airbus.com/innovation/future-by-airbus/smarter-skies/aircraft-take-off-in-continuous-eco-climb/|title=Future by Airbus|last=|first=|date=|website=airbus.com|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and functionality ==
The aircraft-installed landing gear and related structures and systems account for 6 to 15 per cent of the [[operating empty weight|empty weight]] of an aircraft, but it is only required on the ground for takeoff and landing as well as for [[taxiing]] and parking. During [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruise flight]], it is carried along as unused [[ballast]]. An aircraft without landing gear could therefore require 8 to 20 per cent less fuel in flight. Furthermore, landing gears are one of the most expensive [[aircraft systems]] and complex in operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mbptech.de/Bilder/Poster_GroLaS.pdf|title = Fliegen ohne Fahrwerk?|date = |accessdate = |website = mbptech.de|publisher = |last = Binnebesel|first = Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, less noise is emitted when the drag of the undercarriage is omitted during approach and the engines are switched off while taxiing on ground.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.dglr.de/publikationen/2012/281494.pdf|title = AIRPORT 2030 – Lösungen für den effizienten Lufttransport der Zukunft|last = Lütjens|first = K.H.|date = 2012|journal = Deutscher Luft- und Raumfahrtkongress|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |page = 7 et seqq.|display-authors = 1|last2 = Lau|first2 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ground carriage provides the means for an aircraft to takeoff and land without carrying an own aircraft-installed landing gear. Instead, the aircraft is equipped with much lighter interfaces, which connect to the ground carriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Every [[airport]] approached by aircraft without landing gear must operate at least one ground carriage. In addition, alternate airports must be available if an airport is closed due to bad weather or a system failure. For emergency landings outside of [[runways]], unsuitable flooring or unpaved ground cannot absorb the high wheel loads. Therefore, the landing gear of heavy long-haul aircraft in emergency landing on unsuitable ground is often not extended, since it would otherwise sink into ground first and then bend or break off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bfu-web.de/DE/Publikationen/Flugunfallinformationen/Berichte/V34%20-%20Flugunfallinfo%20Notlandung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|title = Notlandung - mit ausgefahrenem Fahrwerk?|last = |first = |date = November 1984|journal = Flugunfall-Information|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |publisher = |editor-last = Flugunfall-Untersuchungsstelle beim Luftfahrt-Bundesamt|issue = V 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related Concepts ==
The precursor of the aircraft ground carriage is the [[Landing gear#Detachable landing gear|jettisonable or detachable landing gear]], wherein the aircraft takes-off from a cart, which is then released and eventually lands on skids. It was used on all operational examples of the [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet|Messerschmitt Me 163B ''Komet'']] with its jettisonable twin-wheel "dolly" main gear — its conventional arrangement included a semi-retractable tailwheel on the ''Komet's'' rear fuselage — and the first eight prototypes of the [[Arado Ar 234|Arado Ar 234 "Blitz"]], which all used a jettisonable tricycle-gear arrangement "trolley" design. The glider [[Schleicher Ka 3|Schleicher Ka 1]], which was built in the 1950s, also had a droppable landing gear. A [[de Havilland Vampire|Sea Vampire Mk.21]] landed with retracted landing gear on an aircraft carrier with flexible rubber decks for testing purposes.

The idea of the aircraft ground carriage is finally related to the [[aircraft catapult]], especially with the [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]], which is currently under development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== GroLaS ==
"GroLaS" (Ground-based Landing gear System) is an aircraft ground carriage system which is being developed since 2008 by a [[Hamburg]]-based company in cooperation with the [[Technical University of Hamburg|Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg]] and the [[German Aerospace Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article122525312/Flugzeuge-starten-und-landen-ohne-Fahrwerk.html|title = Flugzeuge starten und landen ohne Fahrwerk|last = Hillmer|first = Angelika|date = 3 December 2013|work = |accessdate = |newspaper = Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/presse/news/article/view-article/future-by-airbus-nutzt-bodenfahrwerkskonzept-aus-hamburg.html|title = "Future by Airbus" nutzt Bodenfahrwerkskonzept aus Hamburg|date = 1 October 2012|accessdate = |website = Hamburg Aviation|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141020164127/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/presse/news/article/view-article/future-by-airbus-nutzt-bodenfahrwerkskonzept-aus-hamburg.html|archivedate = 20 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the setup of a small scale demonstrator is envisioned, the full scale system is planned to be ready for market entry in 2035. The focus of the GroLaS study starts with long-haul [[cargo aircraft]]. In a first implementation of the system, the world's major cargo airports and corresponding alternate airports have to be equipped. The costs for an airport are expected to be 500 million euros.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GroLaS is patented in Europe, the USA and China. A model in 1:87 scale, which was built in 2013, was exhibited at the [[ILA Berlin Air Show|Berlin Air Show]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abendblatt.de/wirtschaft/article128240704/Hamburg-auf-der-Luftfahrtmesse-ILA.html|title = Hamburg auf der Luftfahrtmesse ILA|last = |first = |date = 21 May 2014|work = |accessdate = |newspaper = Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GroLaS consists of a slide which speeds up and slows down by means of a [[Maglev|maglev system]] installed on both sides of the runway. Thus, the conventional runway remains and enables a dual usability of conventional aircraft and of aircraft without installed landing gear. Upon landing, the slide automatically accelerates the mounted ground carriage to the approaching speed of the aircraft before touchdown and adjusts its position longitudinally and laterally to the aircraft. Pins located on the ground carriage couple into corresponding aircraft installed interfaces. Takeoff and landing are less susceptible to side winds due to a [[Euler angles#Tait.E2.80.93Bryan angles|yaw angle]] adjustment. The braking energy is converted into electrical energy, which can be used to support the aircraft engines during takeoff. The braking distance is shortened, and there is no [[Thrust reversal|reverse thrust]] required. For taxiing, the ground carriage can be decoupled from the slide to remain underneath the aircraft.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== GABRIEL ==
"GABRIEL" ("Integrated Ground and on-board system for support of the Aircraft Safe Takeoff and Landing") is a research project to develop an aircraft ground carriage started in 2011 by a consortium of several European universities, companies and institutions.

The proposed aircraft ground carriage moves on its own electromagnetic rail system and not on a conventional runway. The pins for attaching to the ground carriage are installed on the aircraft and the aircraft needs to synchronize laterally to the position of the ground carriage, which is a different approach compared to the GroLaS-concept.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Rohacs|first = Daniel|last2 = Voskuijl|first2 = Mark|last3 = Rohacs|first3 = Jozsef|last4 = Schoustra|first4 = Rommert-Jan|date = 2013|title = Preliminary evaluation of the environmental impact related to aircraft take-off and landings supported with ground based (MAGLEV) power|url = http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-aerospace-operations/aop040|journal = Journal of Aerospace Operations|issue = 2|page = 161|doi =|pmid =|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels are the longitudinal and yaw angle synchronisation and, that the electrically driven ground carriage is designed demountable from the slide for taxiing.

'''Buddhist art''' originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the centuries following the life of the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world. Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].

A common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]]. From a viewer's perspective, it represents schematically the ideal universe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blume|first1=Nancy|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://asiasociety.org/exploring-mandala|website=Asia Society|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Cristian|title=Mandala|url=https://www.ancient.eu/mandala/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of aspirants and adepts, a spiritual teaching tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction. Its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] saw the mandala as ''"a representation of the center of the unconscious self,"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm Carl Jung and the Mandala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024061549/http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm |date=October 24, 2009 }} Retrieved January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and believed his paintings of mandalas enabled him to identify emotional disorders and work towards wholeness in personality.&lt;ref&gt;See C G Jung: ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', pp.186–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutanese art==
{{Main article|Bhutanese art}}
[[File:Bhutanese thanka of Mt. Meru and the Buddhist Universe.jpg|thumb|upright|Bhutanese [[thanka]] of [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mt. Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]

'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive “spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom’ is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the ‘[[Folk Heritage Museum]]’ in Thimphu. There is also a ‘Voluntary Artists Studio’ in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=June 7, 2010|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodian art==
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|thumb|right|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]] ([[Angkor]])]]
{{Main article|Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian art|Khmer sculpture}}
'''Cambodian art''' and the culture of [[Cambodia]] has had a rich and varied history dating back many centuries and has been heavily influenced by [[India]]. In turn, Cambodia greatly influenced [[Thailand]], Laos and vice versa. Throughout Cambodia's long history, a major source of inspiration was from religion. Throughout nearly two millennium, a Cambodians developed a unique [[Khmer people|Khmer]] belief from the syncreticism of indigenous [[animistic]] beliefs and the Indian religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Indian culture and civilization, including its language and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century CE. It is generally believed that seafaring merchants brought Indian customs and culture to ports along the gulf of Thailand and the Pacific while trading with China. The first state to benefit from this was [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]. At various times, Cambodia culture also absorbed elements from [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Laos|Lao]], and [[Thailand|Thai]] cultures.

===Visual arts of Cambodia===
[[File:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|thumb|left|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Cambodia|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE]]

The history of [[Visual arts of Cambodia]] stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak during the [[Angkor]] period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Pottery|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.

By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.

The sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power. The artists who sculpted the stones doubtless satisfied the primary objectives and requisites demanded by the persons who commissioned them. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeed in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

==Chinese art==
{{Main article|Chinese art|Chinese painting|Chinese ceramics|Chinese jade|Chinese calligraphy}}
'''Chinese art''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) has varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology. Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (詞) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (趙孟頫) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].

'''Indian art''' can be classified into specific periods, each reflecting certain religious, political and cultural developments. The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&amp;nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. 

The art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].

The contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. 

During the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].

One of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.

The visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], "Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail."

Insight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.

Specific periods: 	

*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] – present)
 	
*Islamic ascendancy (712–1757 [[Common Era|CE]])

*The colonial period (1757–1947)

*Modern and Postmodern art in India 

*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)

'''Indonesian art''' and culture has been shaped by long [[interaction]] between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. [[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Indonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.

[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]
Other exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.

Indonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.

[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760–830&amp;nbsp;AD]]
Most notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.

Calligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.

===Balinese art===

[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]
'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes Balinese art as, "... a highly developed, although informal Baroque folk art that combines the peasant liveliness with the refinement of classicism of Hinduistic Java, but free of the conservative prejudice and with a new vitality fired by the exuberance of the demonic spirit of the tropical primitive". Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''&lt;ref name="Eiseman"&gt;

In the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.

This groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.&lt;ref name="Geertz-Images_of_Power"&gt;

Among western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;

More importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.

'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.

The art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''
[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]
{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.

The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC – 300&amp;nbsp;AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300–700&amp;nbsp;AD).

Ancient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal—especially [[bronze]]—and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture – except for miniaturized works – had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.

''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning "floating world", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term "Sorrowful World" (憂き世), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.

==Korean art==
[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (금강전도, 金剛全圖), Korea, c.1734]]

{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}
'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.

While there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.

The study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]’s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea’s own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''

Generally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

Throughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.

This distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].

'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japans' annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated "While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laotian art==
{{Main article|Lao art}}
[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]
'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].

Lao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].

Many beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.

==Nepalese art==
{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}
The ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

==Thai art==
{{Main article|Thai art}}
[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]
'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.

Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.

The Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the "walking Buddha" pose.

Sukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[Pāli|Pali]] texts:
*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; 
*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;
*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];
*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;
*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;
*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;
*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;
*[[human head|head]] like an egg;
*Hair like scorpion stingers;
*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;
*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;
*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;
*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;
*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.

Sukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.

==Tibetan art==
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]
{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}

'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].

As [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.

Tibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.
[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]
A visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.

Historians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. The History of Tibet. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the Qing Dynasty, "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;

==Vietnamese art==
[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum surface.gif|thumb|upright|Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface, 2nd to 3rd century BCE]]

{{Main article|Vietnamese art}}
'''Vietnamese art''' is from one of the oldest of such cultures in the Southeast Asia region. A rich artistic heritage that dates to prehistoric times and includes: silk painting, sculpture, pottery, ceramics, woodblock prints, architecture, music, dance and theatre.
[[File:To Ngoc Van thieu nu ben hoa hue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tô Ngọc Vân, ''Thiếu nữ bên hoa huệ (Young Woman with Lily)'', 1943, oil]]
[[Vietnamese art|Traditional Vietnamese art]] is art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate [[Đông Sơn drums]]) to post-[[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] art which was strongly influenced by [[Buddhist art|Chinese Buddhist art]], among other philosophies such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.



The Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.

The [[Nguyễn dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802–1945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn dynasty.

Beginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History – A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="vcw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Thế Giới Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here]&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt; Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt;

Modern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.

===Vietnamese calligraphy===
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Quốc Ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.

==Filipino art==
{{see also|Culture of Philippines|Art of the Philippines}}
[[File:Filipino Painting 12.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|[[José Honorato Lozano]] painting of Calle Sebastian, Quiapo, Manila in the mid-1800s with its iconic [[Bahay na bato]] architectures. The painting style strongly indicates a melting pot of east and west that resulted to its own originality.]]
[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[José Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.
[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]
Kutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art.

The '''Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics''' ('''IPAM''') is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematics]] institute funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]. The initial funding for the institute was approved in May 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=753  | title = NSF Opts for Three Institutes: UCLA's IPAM To Join IMA, MSRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated in  August, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/reception.html | title = Inaugural Lectures  and Opening Reception   Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPAM is located on the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] campus, in close proximity to UCLA's Department of Mathematics. The building currently housing the institute was designed in  1973 by world-renowned [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=753  | title = Newest NSF Institute Open Its Doors, Notices of the AMS, Volume 47, Number 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of the institute is to make connections between a broad spectrum of mathematicians and scientists, to launch new collaborations, to better inform mathematicians and scientists about interdisciplinary problems, and to broaden the range of applications in which mathematics is used.

IPAM seeks to bring the full range of mathematical techniques to bear on the great scientific challenges of our time, to stimulate exciting new mathematics via new problems motivated by other sciences, and to train the people who will do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/about.aspx  | title =IPAM  &amp;mdash; About Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
IPAM is currently one of eight [http://www.mathinstitutes.org NSF Mathematical Sciences Institutes] in the [[United States]]. The initial five year grant was renewed in 2005, and this grant was once again renewed in 2010, for an additional five years.

The institute was co-founded by [[Tony F. Chan]], Mark Green, and [[Eitan Tadmor]]; [[Russel E. Caflisch|Russ Caflisch]] is its current director. Christian Ratsch and [[Skip Garibaldi]] are its current associate directors. [[Stanley Osher]] is its current special projects director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/people/directors.aspx  | title =IPAM  &amp;mdash; Directors Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Every year IPAM offers two three-month scientific programs, or long programs. These programs bring together senior and junior mathematicians and scientists and engineers from the scientific disciplines related to the program. In addition, IPAM supports graduate students, post-doctoral scholars and young academics to encourage their participation in long programs.

The programs consist of three phases: Tutorials from both streams are offered at the beginning. These are followed by four five-day workshops focusing on particular topics related to the overall theme of the program. The programs culminate with a 1-week [[Oberwolfach]]-like workshop at the [[UCLA]] at [[Lake Arrowhead, California]].

Between the long programs, IPAM sponsors independent five-day workshops on a broad range of scientific themes. During the summer IPAM holds a research program for undergraduates (RIPS) focusing on industrial problems as well as a summer school for graduate students. The graduate student summer school is dedicated to an important scientific theme involving problems of mathematical interest.

'''James P. Carse''' is [[Professor Emeritus]] of history and literature of religion at [[New York University]]. His book ''[[Finite and Infinite Games]]'' was widely influential.  Although Dr. Carse may not believe in God, he describes himself as religious "in the sense that I am endlessly fascinated with the unknowability of what it means to be human, to exist at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Paulson |authorlink= |title=Religion is poetry |url=http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |agency= |work= |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=23 December 2008 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818182051/http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |archivedate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carse's recent work on religion and belief provides a foil to [[New Atheism]].  His ideas about religion and belief were featured on the May 4, 2012 [[CBC Radio]] series [[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]] titled [http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2012/05/03/after-atheism-new-perspectives-on-god-and-religion-part-4/ After Atheism: New Perspectives on God and Religion, Part 4].

His novel ''PhDeath: The Puzzler Murders''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-62316-066-1|title=Fiction Book Review: PhDeath: The Puzzler Murders by James P. Carse.

'''Leptocephalus''' (meaning "slim head"&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com_leptocephalus"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leptocephalus | title=Leptocephalus &amp;#124; Definition of leptocephalus by Merriam-Webster | website=www.merriam-webster.com | publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | access-date=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the flat and [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[larva]] of the [[eel]], marine eels, and other members of the superorder [[Elopomorpha]]. This is one of the most diverse groups of [[teleost]]s, containing 801 species in 4 orders, 24 families, and 156 genera.&lt;ref name="Source 15"&gt;Inuoe, Jun, M.

==Description==
Leptocephali (singular leptocephalus) all have laterally compressed bodies&lt;ref name="Source 5"&gt;Miller, Michael J. “Ecology of Anguilliform Leptocephali: Remarkable Transparent Fish Larvae of the Ocean Surface Layer.” Aqua-BioScience Monographs 2 (2009): 1-94. Web. 2 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; that contain transparent jelly-like substances on the inside of the body and a thin layer of muscle with visible myomeres on the outside.&lt;ref name = "Source 6" /&gt; Their body organs are small and they have only a simple tube for a gut.&lt;ref name ="Source 6" &gt;Fahay, Michael (1983-07-01). "Guide to the Early Stages of Marine Fishes occurring in the Western North Atlantic Ocean, Cape Hatteras to the Southern Scotian Shelf." Journal of Northwest Atlantic Fishery Science 4 (1983): 46-61, 1 July 1983. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from http://journal.nafo.int/Volumes/Articles/ID/14/Guide-to-the-Early-Stages-of-Marine-Fishes-occurring-in-the-Western-North-Atlantic-Ocean-Cape-Hatteras-to-the-Southern-Scotian-Shelf.&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of features results in them being very transparent when they are alive. Leptocephali have dorsal and anal fins confluent with caudal fins, but lack pelvic fins.&lt;ref name="Source 6" /&gt; They also lack [[red blood cell]]s until they begin to metamorphose into the juvenile [[glass eel]] stage when they start to look like eels. Leptocephali are also characterized by their fang-like teeth that are present until metamorphosis, when they are lost.&lt;ref name = "Source 6" /&gt;

Leptocephali differ from most [[fish larvae]] because they grow to much larger sizes&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; and have long larval periods of about three months to more than a year. Another distinguishing feature of these organisms is their mucinous pouch.&lt;ref name = "Source 15" /&gt; They move with typical anguilliform swimming motions&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; and can swim forwards and backwards.&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; Their food source was difficult to determine because zooplankton, which are the typical food of fish larvae, were never seen in their guts.&lt;ref&gt;Mochioka, N. and M. Iwamizu (1996). “Diet of anguilloid larvae: leptocephali feed selectively on [[larvacea]]n houses and fecal pellets.” Marine Biology 125 (1996): 447–452. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00353257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leptocephali appear to feed on tiny particles floating free in the ocean, which are often referred to as [[marine snow]]. Leptocephali larvae live primarily in the upper {{convert|100|m}} of the ocean at night,&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; and often a little deeper during the day. Leptocephali are present worldwide in the oceans from southern temperate to tropical latitudes, where adult eels and their close relatives live. American eels, European eels, conger eels, and some oceanic species spawn and are found in the [[Sargasso Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;McCleave, J.D. (1993). “Physical and behavioural controls on the oceanic distribution and migration of leptocephali.” [Abstract] Journal of Fish Biology 43 (1993): 243-273. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1993.tb01191.x.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' was declared as a biological species in 1856, but was later found to be the larva of ''[[Anguilla anguilla]]'', which was declared by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758 and thus has priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=314762|title=WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Leptocephalus brevirostris Kaup, 1856|work=marinespecies.org|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The development of leptocephali can be summarized briefly. The eggs of eels in the Anguilliformes order are quite large compared to those of many other fishes.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; They are about {{convert|1|–|4|mm|um thou}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; Once the larvae are newly hatched, the yolk extends posteriorly.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; Some larvae hatch with features of the head more developed than others.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The preleptocephalus stage is the period immediately after the larvae hatch.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; During this stage, the larvae do not yet feed externally.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; These larvae typically have poorly developed eyes and few or no teeth.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt;

The leptocephalus stage of the larvae begins after the nutrients from the yolk have been absorbed and the eyes and teeth are formed.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; At this point, the larvae usually have long forward-facing pointy teeth.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; As the larvae grow larger, the teeth will be replaced by shorter teeth and will increase in number.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The maximum size larvae reach varies from about {{convert|5|–|10|cm|0}} but can be as large as {{convert|30|cm}} or more depending on the species.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; After the leptocephali have reached their maximum size, they enter their glass eel stage. Their laterally compressed bodies tend to become more rounded in this stage.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The head also thickens, the olfactory organ enlarges, and their teeth are lost.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt;

Leptocephali differ from other fish larvae in their development. In other teleosts (those without leptocephali), the egg hatches and then the larvae get nutrients from a [[yolk sac]].&lt;ref name = "Source 20" &gt;Pfeiler, Edward (1986). "Towards and Explanation of the Developmental Strategy in Leptocephalus Larvae of Marine Teleost Fishes." Environmental Biology of Fishes 15 (1986): 3-13. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, external feeding begins once the yolk sac has depleted.&lt;ref name ="Source 20" /&gt; The larvae begin to increase in size and develop into a juvenile fish once external feeding begins.&lt;ref name = "Source 20" /&gt; In those fish with a leptocephalus stage; however, after hatching and obtaining nutrients from the yolk, the larvae do not begin external feeding.&lt;ref name =" Source 20" /&gt; This is peculiar because the larvae still continue to grow in size.&lt;ref name ="Source 20" /&gt; From this information, it is concluded that one of the biggest and most basic differences in the developmental cycles of teleosts without leptocephali and teleosts with leptocephali is the food source that the larvae use.&lt;ref name = "Source 20" /&gt;

Leptocephali are poorly understood, partly because they are very fragile and eat particulate material instead of zooplankton, and their good swimming ability lets them avoid most standard-sized plankton nets used by marine biologists. A video recording of a naturally swimming leptocephalus filmed at night off the island of Hawaii shows an example of their swimming behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmuseum.net.au/movie/Ophichthid-leptocephalus-Kona-Hawaii/|title=Ophichthid leptocephalus off Kona, Hawaii - Australian Museum|work=australianmuseum.net.au|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual system==
Two facts are known regarding the visual system of the leptocephali. The first is that they have a rod-dominated visual system.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Scott Michael, Ellis Loew, and Michael Grace (2011). “A rod-dominated visual system in leptocephalus larvae of elopomorph fishes (Elopomorpha: Teleostei).” Environmental Biology of Fishes 92 (2011): 513-523. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that the Synaphobranchidae (a specific family of leptocephali) have telescopic eyes, meaning a tubular eye with a sphere-shaped lens on the top occurs.&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt;

==Aquaculture==
Some progress has been made to grow the leptocephali of the [[Japanese eel]] in the laboratory. The goal of that effort is to produce [[glass eels]] through artificial spawning and larval rearing, to be used for aquaculture to produce [[unagi]] for food. Unagi is a popular food in Japan and East Asia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Leptocephali are rarely used as food, except in some parts of Japan. The leptocephali of the common Japanese conger, ''[[Conger myriaster]]'', are called '''''noresore'''''·[[w:ja:のれそれ|のれそれ]] in [[Kōchi Prefecture]], [[Japan]], and are often served uncooked to the table, and are eaten after dipping in ''tosazu'' mixed [[vinegar]]. It is a spring seasonal specialty.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

A '''mechanical joint''' is a section of a [[machine]] which is used to connect one or more mechanical part to another. Mechanical joints may be temporary or permanent, most types are designed to be disassembled. Most mechanical joints are designed to allow relative movement of these mechanical parts of the machine in one degree of freedom (insert LINK), and restrict movement in one or more others.  Mechanical joints are much cheaper and are usually bought ready assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Blake | first1 = Alexander | title = Design of mechanical joints | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-8247-7351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(please add other joints like: U-joint, ball joint, prismatic joint)

==Knuckle joint==
{{main|Knuckle joint (mechanical)}}

A knuckle joint is used to connect the two rods which are under the tensile load, when there is requirement of small amount of flexibility or angular movement is necessary. There is always axial or linear line of action of load.

The knuckle joint assembly consist of following major components:

1. Single eye.

2. Double eye or fork

3. Knuckle pin.

At one end of the rod the single eye is formed and double eye is formed at the other end of the rod. Both, single and double eye are connected by a pin inserted through eye. The pin has a head at one end and at other end there is a taper pin or split pin. For gripping purpose the ends of the rod are of octagonal forms. Now, when the two eyes are pulled apart, the pin holds them together. The solid rod portion of the joint in this case is much stronger than the portion through which the pin passes.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=R.S. Khurmi, J.K.|title=A textbook of machine design (S.I. units) : [a textbook for the students of B.E. / B.Tech., U.P.S.C. (Engg. Services); Section 'B' of A.M.I.E. (1)]|year=2008|publisher=Eurasia Publishing House|location=Ram Nagar, New Delhi|isbn=81-219-2537-1|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The modes of failure are:'''

1.Shear failure of pin (single shear).

2.Crushing of pin against rod.

3.Tensile failure of flat end bar.

'''Application:'''

1.Tie rod joint of roof truss.

2.Tension link in bridge structure.

3.Link of roller chain.

4.Tie rod joint of jib crane.

5.The knuckle joint is also used in tractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhandari|first=V.B.|title=Introduction to machine design|year=2001|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-07-043449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''

===Design of knuckle joint===
'''&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

The assembly diagram of knuckle joint is as shown in fig.

The dimension of knuckle joints are

Diameter of rod = '''d'''

Diameter of knuckle pin = '''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Outside diameter of single eye = '''d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Outside diameter of double eye = '''d&lt;sub&gt;od&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Thickness of single eye = '''t'''

Thickness of fork = '''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Axial tensile force on rod = '''P'''

'''(1) Diameter of rod'''

Consider the rod is subjected to a direct tensile stress

'''ς = P /πd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

From above equation, diameter of rod 'd' is obtained.

'''(2) Design of pin (d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

(a) Consider the failure of pin under double shear due to tensile force.

Therefore, direct shear stress induced in knuckle pin is given by Equation

'''ς= P/ 2A = (P/2) / (π/4)d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2P/ πd&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

(b) Failure of knuckle pin in bending

Assume there is no clearance or slack but in actual, knuckle pin is loose in forks to permit angular moment of one with respect to other, so it is subjected to bending moment in addition to shear, consider uniformly distributed load along the portion of pin.

Taking moment about axis XX

'''M = [(-P/2) × (t/4)] + { (P/2) × [ (t/2)+(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3) ] }'''

'''= P/2 [(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3)+(t/2)-(t/4) ]'''

'''=P/2 [ (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3)+(t/4) ]'''

Section modulus,

'''Z=(π/ 32)d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''

Maximum bending stress, '''σ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;= M/Z = { P/2 [(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/3)+(t/4)] } / {(π/ 32)d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}'''

Here,we check the pin in bending and find the value of '''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(3) Design of single eye :'''

(a) To find the outside diameter of single eye (d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;) The single eye is subjected to a direct tensile stress, due to this single eye under tear.

'''σt = P/A = P/ (d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;-d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)× t'''

(b) Due to direct tensile strength, the single eye is subjected to double shear.

'''Resisting shearing area = 2(d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;-d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)×(t/2)'''

The direct shear stress induced is

'''ς=P/(d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;-d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)×t'''

From this equation the outside diameter of single eye '''d&lt;sub&gt;oe&lt;/sub&gt;''' is obtained.

(C) Failure of single eye or pin due to tensile load in crushing

'''Resisting crushing area = d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; × t'''

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = P/(d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;×t)'''

Form this equation  crushing stress checked if fail, increase the thickness of eye '''(t)'''.

'''(4) Design of fork (double eye):'''

(a) The tearing of the double eye at weakest section due to tension

'''Area resisting tear = (d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) × 2 t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; =    p/ [(d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) × 2 t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]'''

From this equation, find the outside diameter of fork '''(dof)'''.

(b) Failure of double eye (fork) in double shear due to tensile load.

'''Area resisting shear  = 4 × [(d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) ]/2 × t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''= 2 × (d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''The shear stress is given by,'''

'''ς = p/[(d&lt;sub&gt;of&lt;/sub&gt; – d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) × 2 t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]'''

From this equation, check shear stress if less than design, increase thickness of fork '''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

(c) Failure double eye in crushing (thickness of fork)

Double eye may fail in crushing due to tensile load

'''The crushing stress is given by,'''

'''σc = P/( 2×d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ×t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

Check crushing stress or find '''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''

==Turnbuckle==
{{main|Turnbuckle}}
The buckle or a coupler is a mechanical joint used to connect two members which are subjected to tensile loading which require slight adjustment of length or tension under loaded conditions. It consist of central hexagonal nut called coupler and tie rod having right hand and left hand threads. A coupler of hexagonal shape is to facilitate the turning of it with a spanner or sometime a hole is provide in the nut so that tommy bar can be inserted for rotating it. As coupler rotate, the tie rod are either pulled together or pushed apart depending upon the direction of the rotation coupler normally the tie rods are made of steel, while coupler is made of steel or C.I.

'''Application :'''

1. To tighten the members of the roof truss.

2. Used to connect link in a mechanism to transfer motion

3. Used between the two railway wagon or bogies.

4. To tighten the cable or stay ropes of electric distribution poles.

'''

===Design of turnbuckle===
'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27822626/Design-of-Turnbuckle|title=Design-of-Turnbuckle|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a turnbuckle, subjected to an axial tensile force P. The various dimensions of the turnbuckle are calculated as follows:

'''(1) Diameter of tie rod ‘d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; :'''

Due to axial tensile load p, the rod is subjected to tensile stress. Also due to twisting moment in the tie rod.

The tie rod is design for direct tensile load of P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=1.25P

The tensile stress induced in tie rod is given by

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 4P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;/ (π×d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;×d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

From above equation the core diameter of the tie rod is obtained. The nominal diameter can be selected from I.S.O metric screw threads table or it can be found by,

'''d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/ 0.84'''

'''(2) Length of couple nut (l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) :'''

Consider the direct shearing of the thread at the root of the coupler nut and the screw.

(a) The direct shear stress induced in screw thread is

'''ς&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; =  P/(π×d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

(b) The direct shear stress induced in nut

'''ς&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; =  P/ (π×d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

Where,

ς&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and ς&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  = shear stress in screw and nut respectively in N/mm2

d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  =   Nominal diameter of the screw

d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; =  Core diameter of the screw

l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; =  Length of the coupler nut

(c) Check of crushing of the thread

'''crushing resistance of the thread = (π/4) × [d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] ×n×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;× σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Where,

n  =   number of threads per length  = l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/p

σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = crushing stress induced in the coupler

p = pitch of the thread in mm

Equating the design load with crushing resistance

'''p&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;  = (π/4) × [d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] ×n×l&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;× σ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
'''

'''(3) Outside diameter of the coupler nut (D) :'''

The coupler nut is subjected to a direct tensile load P and a torque T.

Consider tearing of the coupler nut due to tensile stress induced in it. In order to account for the torque, the tensile load is taken as P&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

The tensile stress induced in coupler nut is given by

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 4P/(π×(D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))'''

By empirical relation, the outside diameter of the coupler nut D is taken as

'''D = 1.25 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; or 1.5 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(4) Outside diameter of coupler (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):'''

Let,D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= Inside diameter of the coupler

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Outside diameter of the coupler

Consider a coupler is subjected to direct tensile load P and a torque T.So for design the coupler outside diameter, the design load is consider.

By empirical relation,

The outside diameter of the coupler D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken as,

'''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; or 1.75 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(5) Length of the coupler nut (L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

'''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  = 6 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(6) Thickness of the coupler = t = 0.75 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''(7)Thickness of the coupler nut = t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'''

'''Message-oriented middleware''' ('''MOM''') is software or hardware infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between [[distributed system]]s. MOM allows [[modular programming|application modules]] to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple [[operating system]]s and [[network protocol]]s. The [[middleware]] creates a distributed communications layer that insulates the [[application developer]] from the details of the various operating systems and network interfaces. [[API]]s that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2004. [http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/1652511/4338215212/cce0f06f047faa57879a1fc36a8e8d6d754d2f6a/dl.pdf "Message-Oriented Middleware"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. {{doi|10.1002/0470862084.ch1}}. {{ISBN|978-0-470-86206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This middleware layer allows software components (applications, Enterprise JavaBeans, servlets, and other components) that have been developed independently and that run on different networked platforms to interact with one another. Applications distributed on different network nodes use the application interface to communicate. In addition, by providing an administrative interface, this new, virtual system of interconnected applications can be made reliable and secure.&lt;ref name="oracle"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Message Oriented Middleware |url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19340-01/820-6424/aeraq/index.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOM provides software elements that reside in all communicating components of a client/server architecture and typically support asynchronous calls between the client and server applications.  MOM reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master-slave nature of the client/server mechanism.

==Middleware categories==

*[[Remote Procedure Call]] or RPC-based middleware
*[[Object Request Broker]] or ORB-based middleware
*Message Oriented Middleware or MOM-based middleware

All these models make it possible for one software component to affect the behavior of another component over a network. They are different in that RPC- and ORB-based middleware create systems of tightly coupled components, whereas MOM-based systems allow for a [[loose coupling|looser coupling]] of components. In an RPC- or ORB-based system, when one procedure calls another, it must wait for the called procedure to return before it can do anything else. In these [[synchronous messaging]] models, the middleware functions partly as a super-linker, locating the called procedure on a network and using network services to pass function or method parameters to the procedure and then to return results.&lt;ref name=oracle/&gt;

==Advantages==

Central reasons for using a message-based communications [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] include its ability to store (buffer), route, or transform [[message]]s while conveying them from senders to receivers.

Another advantage of messaging provider mediated messaging between clients is that by adding an administrative interface, you can monitor and tune performance. Client applications are thus effectively relieved of every problem except that of sending, receiving, and processing messages. It is up to the code that implements the MOM system and up to the administrator to resolve issues like interoperability, reliability, security, scalability, and performance.

===Asynchronicity===
Using a MOM system, a client makes an API call to send a message to a destination managed by the provider. The call invokes provider services to route and deliver the message. Once it has sent the message, the client can continue to do other work, confident that the provider retains the message until a receiving client retrieves it. The message-based model, coupled with the mediation of the provider, makes it possible to create a system of loosely coupled components.

MOM comprises a category of inter-[[application software|application]] [[communication software]] that generally relies on [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] [[message passing|message-passing]], as opposed to a [[request-response]] architecture.  In asynchronous systems, [[message queue]]s provide temporary storage when the destination program is busy or not connected.  In addition, most asynchronous MOM systems provide [[persistent storage]] to [[backup|back up]] the message queue.  This means that the sender and receiver do not need to connect to the network at the same time ([[asynchrony (computing)|asynchronous delivery]]), and problems with intermittent connectivity are solved.  It also means that should the receiver application fail for any reason, the senders can continue unaffected, as the messages they send will simply accumulate in the [[message queue]] for later processing when the receiver restarts.

===Routing===
Many message-oriented middleware implementations depend on a [[message queue]] system.  Some implementations permit routing logic to be provided by the messaging layer itself, while others depend on client applications to provide routing information or allow for a mix of both paradigms.  Some implementations make use of [[Broadcasting (networks)|broadcast]] or [[multicast]] distribution paradigms.

===Transformation===
In a message-based middleware system, the message received at the destination need not be identical to the message originally sent. A MOM system with built-in intelligence can [[Data transformation|transform]] messages en route to match the requirements of the sender or of the recipient.&lt;ref name="MOM"&gt;[http://www.edwardcurry.org/web_publications/curry_DEBS_04.pdf E. Curry, D. Chambers, and G. Lyons, "Extending Message-Oriented Middleware using Interception", presented at Third International Workshop on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS '04), ICSE '04, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the routing and broadcast/[[multicast]] facilities, one application can send a message in its own native format, and two or more other applications may each receive a copy of the message in their own native format. Many modern MOM systems provide sophisticated message transformation (or mapping) tools which allow [[software developer|programmer]]s to specify transformation rules applicable to a simple [[graphical user interface|GUI]] [[drag-and-drop]] operation.

==Disadvantages==

The primary disadvantage of many message-oriented middleware systems is that they require an extra component in the [[software architecture|architecture]], the message transfer agent ([[message broker]]).  As with any [[system]], adding another component can lead to reductions in [[computer performance|performance]] and reliability, and can also make the system as a whole more difficult and expensive to [[software maintenance|maintain]].

In addition, many inter-application communications have an intrinsically [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]] aspect, with the sender specifically wanting to wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see [[real-time computing]] and [[near real time|near-real-time]] for extreme cases). Because message-based [[data communication|communication]] inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations.  That said, most MOM systems have facilities to group a request and a response as a single pseudo-synchronous transaction.

With a synchronous messaging system, the calling function does not return until the called function has finished its task. In a [[loose coupling|loosely coupled]] asynchronous system, the calling client can continue to load work upon the recipient until the resources needed to handle this work are depleted and the called component fails. Of course, these conditions can be minimized or avoided by monitoring performance and adjusting message flow, but this is work that is not needed with a synchronous messaging system. The important thing is to understand the advantages and liabilities of each kind of system. Each system is appropriate for different kinds of tasks. Sometimes, a combination of the two kinds of systems is required to obtain the desired behavior.

==Standards==
Historically, there was a lack of [[standardization|standards]] governing the use of message-oriented middleware that has caused problems.  Most of the major vendors have their own implementations, each with its own [[application programming interface]] (API) and management tools.

One of the long-standing standards for message oriented middleware is X/Open group's XATMI specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XATMI Specification) which standardizes API for [[interprocess communication]]s. Known implementations for this API is ATR Baltic's [[Enduro/X]] middleware and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s [[Tuxedo (software)|Tuxedo]].

The [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol]] (AMQP) is an approved [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amqp.org/node/102 1.0 Becomes OASIS Standard]. AMQP (2012-10-31). Retrieved on 2014-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=64955 ISO/IEC 19464:2014]&lt;/ref&gt; standard that defines the protocol and formats used between participating application components, so implementations are interoperable.  AMQP may be used with flexible routing schemes, including common [[Messaging pattern|messaging paradigms]] like [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]], [[Fan-out (software)|fan-out]], [[publish/subscribe]], and [[request-response]] (note that these are intentionally omitted from v1.0 of the protocol standard itself, but rely on the particular implementation and/or underlying network protocol for routing). It also supports transaction management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous multi-platform support. Java applications that use AMQP are typically written in Java JMS. Other implementations provide APIs for C#, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other languages.

The [[High-level architecture|High-Level Architecture]] (HLA IEEE 1516) is an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization|SISO]] standard for simulation interoperability. It defines a set of services, provided through an API in C++ or Java. The services offer publish/subscribe based information exchange, based on a modular Federation Object Model. There are also services for coordinated data exchange and time advance, based on logical simulation time, as well as synchronization points. Additional services provide transfer of ownership, data distribution optimizations and monitoring and management of participating Federates (systems).

The [[MQ Telemetry Transport]] (MQTT) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) supported by the OASIS organization. It provides a lightweight publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport protocol on top of TCP/IP suitable for communication in M2M/IoT contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

The [[Object Management Group]]'s [[Data Distribution Service| Data Distribution Service (DDS)]] provides message-oriented [[Publish–subscribe pattern|Publish/Subscribe (P/S)]] middleware standard that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high performance and interoperable data exchanges between publishers and subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems (DDS), Object Management Group, version 1.2, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The standard provides interfaces to C++, C++11, C, Ada, Java and Ruby.

The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ([[XMPP]]) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.  Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license; although many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.  XMPP-based software is deployed widely across the Internet, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation, and forms the basis for the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Capabilities Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/UCCO/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR2013/01_Framework_2013.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040719/http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/UCCO/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR2013/01_Framework_2013.pdf|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Java EE]] programming environment provides a standard API called [[Java Message Service|JMS]] (Java Message Service), which is implemented by most MOM vendors and aims to hide the particular MOM API implementations; however, JMS does not define the format of the messages that are exchanged, so JMS systems are not interoperable.

A similar effort is with the actively evolving [[OpenMAMA]] project, which aims to provide a common API, particularly to C clients. However, at the moment (August 2012) it is primarily appropriate for distributing market-oriented data (e.g. stock quotes) over pub-sub middleware.

==Message queuing==
{{see also|Message queuing service}}
[[Message queue]]s allow the exchange of information between distributed applications. A message queue can reside in memory or disk storage. Messages stay in the queue until the time they are processed by a service consumer. Through the message queue, the application can be implemented independently - they do not need to know each other's position, or continue to implement procedures to remove the need for waiting to receive this message.&lt;ref name=tutorialsto&gt;http://www.tutorialsto.com/software/engineering/middleware/message-oriented-middleware-and-the-websphere-mq-introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

A '''modular vehicle''' is one in which substantial components of the vehicle are interchangeable. This modularity is intended to make repairs and maintenance easier, or to allow the vehicle to be reconfigured to suit different functions.

Another application of modular vehicle design is to enable the exchange of batteries in an electric vehicle.

In a modular electric vehicle, the power system, wheels and suspension can be contained in a single module or chassis. When the batteries need recharging, the vehicle's body is lifted off and placed onto a fresh power module. By using this ''Modular Vehicle'' system, the vehicle's batteries do not have to be removed or reinstalled, and their connections remain intact.

==History of the modern modular vehicle==
[[File:Ridek3 modular electric vehicle.jpg|thumb|The Ridek III body and chassis can be separated to change body styles or to put the same body on a chassis with fully charged batteries.]]
The world's first road-licensed quick-change modular electric vehicle, based on a patent awarded to Dr Gordon E Dower in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Dower, Gordon E, 2000, US Patent: [http://patents.com/us-6059058.html "Modular vehicle construction and transportation system"]&lt;/ref&gt; was shown at the [[World Electric Vehicle Association]] 2003 Electric Vehicle Symposium EVS-20 in Long Beach, California, USA. 

Dower described the vehicle's two parts as its motorized deck, shortened to ''Modek'', and its "containing module" or ''Ridon''. When attached to each other, the vehicle thus formed was dubbed the ''Ridek''. Mechanical connections between the modules for braking and steering automatically engage when the body is lowered on to the chassis.
 
In 2004, General Motors attempted to patent a modular vehicle called ''Autonomy''&lt;ref&gt;Patent application 10/966,548, filed 10/15/2004, assigned General Motors, lead inventor Adrian B Chernoff&lt;/ref&gt; but the attempt was unsuccessful because Dower’s patent already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Patent 10/966/548,denied 2/23/2006, Attorney docket no: GP -3015791/GM0268PUS-1&lt;/ref&gt; 

A team at GM did, however, continue to work on Autonomy, which was intended to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. They unveiled a non-drivable version of their modular vehicle in January 2002 at the Detroit Auto Show.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;King, Ralph, [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/10/01/349458/index.htm "GM's Race to the Future - the inside story of how the world's biggest automaker came to see the hydrogen car as its salvation - and took the lead in the engineering challenge of the century"], ''Business 2.0'' Magazine, Oct 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; GM unveiled a drivable prototype, called [[General Motors Hy-wire|Hy-wire]] at the Paris Auto Show in September, 2002.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The name referred to the Hydrogen fuel and the "drive-by-wire" system that electronically connected the vehicle modules for steering, braking and controlling the 4 wheel motors. Hy-wire did not go into production.

==Flexibility==

Modular vehicles make it possible to use different types of bodies, e.g. sedan, sports car or pickup truck, on one standardized chassis.&lt;ref&gt;Chernoff, Adrian B et al, 2003 US Patent: [http://patents.com/us-20030094319.html "Vehicle body interchangeability"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the modular chassis, with its batteries and motor, are relatively easy to work on, since there is no vehicle body to impede access.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">The notion of '''musical similarity''' is particularly complex because there are numerous dimensions of similarity. If similarity takes place between different fragments from one musical piece, a musical similarity implies a [[repetition (music)|repetition]] of the first occurring fragment. As well, eventually, the similarity does not occur by direct repetition, but by presenting in two (or more) set of relations, some common values or patterns. Objective musical similarity can be based on musical features such as:

Pitched parameters
* [[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] interval similarity
* [[Melody|Melodic]] similarity&lt;ref&gt;Greg Aloupis, Thomas Fevens, [[Stefan Langerman]], Tomomi Matsui, Antonio Mesa, Yurai Nunez, and David Rappaport, and Godfried T. Toussaint, "Algorithms for computing geometric measures of melodic similarity," ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 30, No. 3, Fall 2006, pp. 67–76.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Modulation (music)|Modulation]] pattern similarity
* [[Timbre|Timbral]] similarity

Non-pitched parameters
* [[Meter (music)|Metrical]] structure similarity
* [[Rhythm]]ic pattern similarity&lt;ref&gt;Godfried T. Toussaint, "A comparison of rhythmic dissimilarity measures," ''FORMA'', Vol. 21, No. 2, 2006, pp. 129–149.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Section (music)|Section]] structure similarity

Semiotic parameters
* [[Modality (semiotics)|Modality]] structure similarity
* [[Extension (semantics)|Extension]]al similarity
* [[Intension]]al similarity

Nevertheless, similarity can be based also on less objective features such as musical genre, personal history, social context (e.g. music from the 1960s), and a priori knowledge.

==Applications==
Automatic methods of musical similarity detection based on [[data mining]] and [[co-occurrence]] analysis has been developed in order to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Pachet]], Geert Westermann, Damien Laigre, [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution]. Proceedings of the 1st WedelMusic Conference, pp. 101-106, Firenze, Italy, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Aerial view 2010 facing south.jpg|thumb|upright|Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland]]
'''[[Goddard Space Flight Center]]''' (GSFC), located in Greenbelt, MD, is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe via observations from space. GSFC is a major U.S. laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts scientific investigation, development and operation of space systems, and development of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and build the spacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist John C. Mather shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]. GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the [[Space Network]] and the [[Near Earth Network]]), develops and maintains advanced space and Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

[[File:Vehicle-Assembly-Building-July-6-2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Kennedy Space Center, Florida]]
'''[[John F. Kennedy Space Center]]''' (KSC), is one of the best known NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. Its iconic [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beattie|first=Rich|title=World's Biggest Buildings |url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-biggest-buildings/11 |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=6 December 2015 |date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the largest when completed in 1965.&lt;ref name="congressional record Sep 8, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Senate|journal=Congressional Record|date=September 8, 2004|page=17598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on Merritt Island, Florida, the center is north-northwest of Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Miami and Jacksonville on Florida's [[Space Coast]]. A total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. Approximately 2,100 &lt;!--2010.

[[File:Site du JPL en Californie.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California]]
'''[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]''' (JPL), located in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] area of Los Angeles County, CA,  was together with [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|ABMA]] one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, the first American space mission and also together with ABMA one of the first agencies to become a part of NASA. The facility is headquartered in the city of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jpl.Nasa.Gov |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/about_JPL/maps.cfm |title=Directions - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=Jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the border of [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]] and Pasadena.  JPL is managed by the nearby [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). The Laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of robotic planetary spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions.  It is also responsible for operating NASA's [[Deep Space Network]].

The '''[[Armstrong Flight Research Center]]''' (AFRC), located inside [[Edwards Air Force Base]], is an aeronautical research center operated by [[NASA]]. Armstrong is NASA's premier site for aeronautical research and operates some of the most advanced [[aircraft]] in the world. It is also the home of the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to [[Kennedy Space Center]] if one lands at Edwards. On December 31, 2012, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted 404–0 to rename the centre previously known as Dryden in honor of [[Neil Armstrong]], the first astronaut to walk on the surface of the moon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1212/31armstrong/  |title=House passes bill to rename NASA facility for Armstrong  | date=2012-12-31  |accessdate=2013-01-01  |publisher=Spaceflight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama officially signed the change into law on January 16, 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Center Redesignated for Neil Armstrong; Test Range for Hugh Dryden |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/Features/nasa-dryden-to-be-renamed-for-neil-armstrong_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Glenn Research Center|John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field]]''' (GRC) located in [[Brook Park, Ohio]], was established in 1942 as part of NACA, and was later incorporated as a NASA laboratory for aircraft engine research. In 1999, the center's name was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field after John Glenn, an American fighter pilot, astronaut and politician. Glenn supports all of the agency's missions and major programs. Glenn excels in researching and developing innovative technologies for both aeronautics and space flight. A multitude of NASA missions have included elements from Glenn, from the Mercury and Gemini projects to the Space Shuttle Program and the International Space Station. The center's core competencies include air-breathing and in-space propulsion and cryogenics, communications, power energy storage and conversion, microgravity sciences, and advanced materials.

[[File:Msfc aerial view.jpg|thumb|upright|George C. Marshal Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama]]
'''[[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]]''' (MSFC) is where the [[Saturn V]] rocket and Spacelab were developed. It is one of the largest centers of [[NASA]]. Marshall is the agency's lead center for [[Space Shuttle]] propulsion and its external tank; payloads and related crew training; [[International Space Station]] (ISS) design and assembly; together with computers, networks, and information management. Located on the [[Redstone Arsenal]] near Huntsville, Alabama, MSFC is named in honor of General [[George Marshall]].

[[File:Aerial View Ames Research Center Wind Tunnels - GPN-2000-001761.jpg|thumb|upright|Ames Research Center wind tunnels]]
'''[[Ames Research Center]]''' (ARC) at [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Moffett Field]] was founded on December 20, 1939 as a NACA laboratory, and became part of NASA in 1958, as part of the turnover from NACA. The center was named after [[Joseph Sweetman Ames]], a founding member of the NACA. ARC is one of NASA’s 10 major field centers and is located in [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]]. Historically, Ames was founded to do wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, it has expanded its role to doing research and technology in aeronautics, spaceflight, and information technology. It provides leadership in [[astrobiology]], small satellites, robotic lunar exploration, intelligent/adaptive systems and thermal protection.

[[File:Langley research center.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Langley Research Center]]
'''[[Langley Research Center]]''' ('''LaRC''') is the oldest of [[NASA]]'s field centers, located in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, United States. LaRC focuses primarily on aeronautical research, though the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo lunar lander]] was flight-tested at the facility and a number of high-profile space missions have been planned and designed on-site. Established in 1917  by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], the Center currently devotes two-thirds of its programs to [[aeronautics]], and the rest to [[outer space|space]]. LaRC researchers use more than 40 [[wind tunnel]]s to study improved [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] safety, performance, and efficiency.  Between 1958 and 1963, when NASA started [[Project Mercury]], LaRC served as the main office of the [[Space Task Group]], with the office being transferred to the Manned Spacecraft Center (now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center) in Houston in 1962&amp;ndash;63.

'''[[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]]''' ('''CDSCC''') is a [[ground station]] that is located in [[Australia]] at Tidbinbilla outside [[Canberra]]. The complex is part of the [[Deep Space Network]] run by JPL. It is commonly referred to as the ''Tidbinbilla Deep Space Tracking Station'' and was officially opened on 19 March 1965. The station is separated from Canberra by the Coolamon Ridge, Urambi Hills and Bullen Range that help shield the city's [[radio frequency]] (RF) noise from the dishes.

The '''[[Applied Physics Laboratory]]''' at [[Johns Hopkins University]] is a major contractor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

==Philosophical issues==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, London|isbn=0393045358|page=524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;lpg=PA534|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that in the years since has served as a challenge to the musicologists and psychologists who believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/survival_of_the_harmonious/?page=1|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Survival of the harmonious|accessdate=2008-03-15|last= Bennett |first=Drake|  date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to note this stir was [[Philip Ball]] in his book ''The Music Instinct'' &lt;ref name="The Music Instinct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=The Music Instinct|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199896429|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Music-Instinct-Works-Without/dp/0199896429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he noted that music seems to reach to the very core of what it means to be human:  "There are cultures in the world where to say 'I'm not musical' would be meaningless," Ball writes, "akin to saying 'I'm not alive'." In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics of music===
{{main article|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|thumb|The layers of the [[Earth]], a differentiated planetary body]]
In [[planetary science]], '''planetary differentiation''' is the process of separating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical or chemical behavior, where the body develops into compositionally distinct layers; the [[density|denser]] materials of a [[planet]] sink to the center, while less dense materials rise to the surface, generally in a [[magma ocean]]. Such a process tends to create a [[Planetary core|core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Sometimes a chemically distinct [[Crust (geology)|crust]] forms on top of the mantle. The process of planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, [[dwarf planet]]s, the asteroid [[4 Vesta]], and [[natural satellite]]s (such as the [[Moon]]). 

==Heating==
When the [[Sun]] ignited in the [[solar nebula]], [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and other volatile materials were evaporated in the region around it. The [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] forced these low-density materials away from the Sun. Rocks, and the elements comprising them, were stripped of their early atmospheres,{{Citation needed|reason=it is not clear whether bodies with atmospheres precede the 'ignition' of the Sun or not|date=July 2012}} but themselves remained, to accumulate into [[protoplanet]]s.

Protoplanets had higher concentrations of [[radioactive]] elements early in their history, the quantity of which has reduced over time due to [[radioactive decay]]. Heating due to radioactivity, impacts, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being [[planet]]s. In melted zones, it was possible for denser materials to sink towards the center, while lighter materials rose to the surface. The compositions of some [[meteorite]]s ([[achondrite]]s) show that differentiation also took place in some [[asteroid]]s (e.g. [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]), that are parental bodies for meteoroids. The short-lived radioactive isotope [[aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] was probably the main source of heat.&lt;ref&gt;de Pater, I., and Lissauer, J.J. 2001. Planetary Sciences, Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prialnik D., Merk R., 2008. Growth and evolution of small porous icy bodies with an adaptive-grid thermal evolution code. I. Application to Kuiper Belt objects and Enceladus. Icarus 197: 211–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

When protoplanets [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accrete]] more material, the energy of impact causes local heating. In addition to this temporary heating, the gravitational force in a sufficiently large body creates pressures and temperatures which are sufficient to melt some of the materials. This allows [[chemical reaction]]s and [[density]] differences to mix and separate materials,{{Citation needed|reason=The mechanism is still unclear, specify|date=July 2012}} and soft materials to spread out over the surface.

On [[Earth]], a large piece of molten [[iron]] is sufficiently denser than [[continental crust]] material to force its way down through the crust to the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} In the outer Solar System a similar process may take place but with lighter materials: they may{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} be [[hydrocarbons]] such as [[methane]], [[water]] as liquid or ice, or frozen [[carbon dioxide]].

==Chemical differentiation==
Although bulk materials differentiate outward or inward according to their density, the elements that are chemically bound in them [[fractionation|fractionate]] according to their chemical affinities, "carried along" by more abundant materials with which they are associated. For instance, although the rare element [[uranium]] is very dense as a pure element, it is chemically more compatible as a trace element in the Earth's light, [[silicate]]-rich crust{{Citation needed|reason=how so|date=July 2012}} than in the dense metallic core.

==Physical differentiation==

===Gravitational separation===
High-[[density]] materials tend to sink through lighter materials. This tendency is affected by the relative structural strengths, but such strength is reduced at temperatures where both materials are plastic or molten. [[Iron]], the most common element that is likely to form a very dense molten metal phase, tends to congregate towards planetary interiors. With it, many [[Siderophile element|siderophile]] elements (i.e. materials that readily [[metal alloy|alloy]] with iron) also travel downward. However, not all heavy elements make this transition as some [[chalcophile|chalcophilic]] heavy elements bind into low-density silicate and oxide compounds, which differentiate in the opposite direction.

The main compositionally differentiated zones in the solid Earth are the very dense iron-rich metallic [[Planetary core|core]], the less dense [[talc|magnesium-silicate]]-rich [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and the relatively thin, light [[Crust (geology)|crust]] composed mainly of silicates of [[aluminium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]] and [[potassium]]. Even lighter still are the watery liquid [[hydrosphere]] and the gaseous, nitrogen-rich [[atmosphere]].

Lighter materials tend to rise through material with a higher density. They may take on dome-shaped forms called [[diapir]]s when doing so. On Earth, [[salt dome]]s are [[salt]] diapirs in the crust which rise through surrounding rock. Diapirs of molten low-density silicate rocks such as [[granite]] are abundant in the Earth's upper crust. The hydrated, low-density [[serpentinite]] formed by alteration of [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material at [[subduction zone]]s can also rise to the surface as diapirs. Other materials do likewise: a low-temperature, near-surface example is provided by [[mud volcano]]s.

===Moon's KREEP===
On the Moon, a distinctive [[basalt]]ic material has been found that is high in "incompatible elements" such as [[potassium]], [[rare earth element]]s, and [[phosphorus]] and is often referred to by the abbreviation [[KREEP]]. It is also high in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. These elements are excluded{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} from the major minerals of the lunar crust which crystallized out from its primeval [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]], and the KREEP basalt may have been trapped as a chemical differentiate between the crust and the mantle, with occasional eruptions to the surface.

===Fractional melting and crystallization===
[[Magma]] in the Earth is produced by [[partial melting]] of a source rock, ultimately in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The melt extracts a large portion of the "incompatible elements" from its source that are not stable in the major minerals. When magma rises above a certain depth the dissolved minerals start to crystallize at particular pressures and temperatures. The resulting solids remove various elements from the melt, and melt is thus depleted of those elements. Study of trace elements in [[igneous rock]]s thus gives us information about what source melted by how much to produce a magma, and which minerals have been lost from the melt.

===Thermal diffusion===
When material is unevenly heated, lighter material migrates toward hotter zones and heavier material migrates towards colder areas, which is known as [[thermophoresis]], thermomigration, or the [[Thermophoresis|Soret effect]]. This process can affect differentiation in [[magma chamber]]s.

===Differentiation through collision===
[[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] probably formed out of material splashed into orbit by the impact of a large body into the early Earth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Differentiation on Earth had probably already separated many lighter materials toward the surface, so that the impact removed a disproportionate amount of silicate material from Earth, and left the majority of the dense metal behind. The Moon's density is substantially less than that of Earth, due to its lack of a large iron core.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Density differences on Earth==
On [[Earth]], physical and chemical differentiation processes led to a crustal density of approximately 2700&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; compared to the 3400&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; density of the compositionally different mantle just below, and the average density of the planet as a whole is 5515&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Telephone cable.jpg|thumb|300px|Telephone cable containing multiple twisted-pair lines]]
The '''primary line constants''' are parameters that describe the characteristics of conductive transmission lines, such as pairs of [[copper]] wires, in terms of the physical electrical properties of the line.  The primary line constants are only relevant to transmission lines and are to be contrasted with the [[secondary line constants]], which can be derived from them, and are more generally applicable.  The secondary line constants can be used, for instance, to compare the characteristics of a [[waveguide]] to a copper line, whereas the primary constants have no meaning for a waveguide.

The constants are conductor resistance and inductance, and insulator capacitance and conductance, which are by convention given the symbols ''R'', ''L'', ''C'', and ''G'' respectively. The constants are enumerated in terms of per unit length. The circuit representation of these elements requires a [[distributed element model]] and consequently [[calculus]] must be used to analyse the circuit.  The analysis yields a system of two first order, simultaneous linear [[Partial differential equation|partial differential equations]] which may be combined to derive the secondary constants of [[characteristic impedance]] and [[propagation constant]].

A number of special cases have particularly simple solutions and important practical applications.  Low loss cable requires only ''L'' and ''C'' to be included in the analysis, useful for short lengths of cable.  Low frequency applications, such as [[twisted pair]] telephone lines, are dominated by ''R'' and ''C'' only.  High frequency applications, such as [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[co-axial cable]], are dominated by ''L'' and ''C''.  Lines [[loading coil|loaded]] to prevent distortion need all four elements in the analysis, but have a simple, elegant solution.

==The constants==
There are four primary line constants, but in some circumstances some of them are small enough to be ignored and the analysis can be simplified.  These four, and their symbols and units are as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
!Name!!Symbol!!Units!!Unit symbol
|-
|loop [[electrical resistance|resistance]]||''R''||[[ohm]]s per [[metre]]||Ω/m
|-
|loop [[inductance]]||''L''||[[henry (unit)|henries]] per metre||H/m
|-
|insulator [[capacitance]]||''C''||[[farad]]s per metre||F/m
|-
|insulator [[electrical conductance|conductance]]||''G''||[[siemens (unit)|siemens]] per metre||S/m
|}

''R'' and ''L'' are elements in series with the line (because they are properties of the conductor) and ''C'' and ''G'' are elements shunting the line (because they are properties of the [[dielectric]] material between the conductors).  ''G'' represents leakage current through the dielectric and in most cables is very small.  The word loop is used to emphasise that the resistance and inductance of both conductors must be taken into account.  For instance, if a line consists of two identical wires that have a resistance of 25 mΩ/m each, the ''loop'' resistance is double that, 50 mΩ/m.  Because the values of the constants are quite small, it is common for manufacturers to quote them per kilometre rather than per metre; in the English-speaking world "per mile" can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.604-605.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "constant" can be misleading. It means that they are material constants; but they may vary with frequency. In particular, ''R'' is heavily influenced by the [[skin effect]].  Furthermore, while ''G'' has virtually no effect at [[audio frequency]], it can cause noticeable losses at high frequency with many of the [[dielectric]] materials used in cables due to a high [[loss tangent]].  Avoiding the losses caused by ''G'' is the reason many cables designed for use at [[UHF]] are air-insulated or foam-insulated (which makes them virtually air-insulated).&lt;ref&gt;Porges, pp.223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual meaning of constant in this context is that the parameter is constant with ''distance''.  That is the line is assumed to be homogenous lengthwise.  This condition is true for the vast majority of transmission lines in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.502-503, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

:† Manufacturers commonly omit a value for inductance in their data sheets.  Some of these values are estimated from the figures for capacitance and characteristic impedance by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {Z_0}^2=L/C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Circuit representation==
[[File:Line model Heaviside.svg|thumb|400px|'''Fig. 1.''' Equivalent circuit representation of a transmission line using distributed elements. {{math|δ''L''}}, {{math|''δR''}}, {{math|''δC''}} and {{math|''δG''}} are to be read as, {{math|''L''δ''x''}}, {{math|''R''δ''x''}}, {{math|''C''δ''x''}} and {{math|''G''δ''x''}} respectively]]
The line constants cannot be simply represented as [[lumped element model|lumped elements]] in a circuit; they must be described as [[distributed element model|distributed elements]].  For instance "pieces" of the capacitance are in between "pieces" of the resistance.  However many pieces the ''R'' and ''C'' are broken into, it can always be argued they should be broken apart further to properly represent the circuit, and after each division the number of [[mesh analysis|mesh]]es in the circuit is increased.  This is shown diagramtically in figure 1.  To give a true representation of the circuit, the elements must be made [[infinitesimal]]ly small so that each element is distributed along the line.  The infinitesimal elements in an infinitesimal distance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dx&lt;/math&gt; are given by;&lt;ref name="Connor, pp.8-10"&gt;Connor, pp.8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;span style="line-height:300%;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dL=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(L\delta x)=Ldx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;dR=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(R\delta x)=Rdx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;dC=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(C\delta x)=Cdx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;dG=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(G\delta x)=Gdx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Line model general impedances.svg|thumb|300px|'''Fig. 2.''' Representation of a transmission line using generalised distributed impedance and admittance elements.]]
It is convenient for the purposes of analysis to roll up these elements into general series [[electrical impedance|impedance]], ''Z'', and shunt [[admittance]], ''Y'' elements such that;
&lt;span style="line-height:300%;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dZ=(R+i \omega L)dx=Zdx\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp; and,
:&lt;math&gt;dY=(G+i \omega C)dx=Ydx\, .&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
Analysis of this network (figure 2) will yield the secondary line constants: the [[propagation constant]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, (whose [[complex analysis|real and imaginary parts]] are the [[attenuation constant]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and [[phase change constant]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively) and the [[characteristic impedance]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, which also, in general, will have real, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and imaginary, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_0&lt;/math&gt;, parts, making a total of four secondary constants to be derived from the four primary constants.  The term constant is even more misleading for the secondary constants as they usually vary quite strongly with frequency, even in an ideal situation where the primary constants do not.  This is because the reactances in the circuit (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1/(\omega C)&lt;/math&gt;) introduce a dependence on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  It is possible to choose specific values of the primary constants that result in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; being independent of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Heaviside condition]]) but even in this case, there is still &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; which is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  As with the primary constants, the meaning of "constant" is that the secondary constants do not vary with distance along the line, not that they are independent of frequency.&lt;ref name="Connor, pp.8-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porges, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristic impedance==
[[File:Line equivalent circuit for Zo.svg|thumb|250px|'''Fig. 3.''' Equivalent circuit of a transmission line for the calculation of Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the primary line constants]]
The characteristic impedance of a transmission line, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the impedance looking into an infinitely long line.  Such a line will never return a reflection since the incident wave will never reach the end to be reflected.  When considering a finite length of the line, the remainder of the line can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; as its equivalent circuit.  This is so because the remainder of the line is still infinitely long and therefore equivalent to the original line.  If the finite segment is very short, then in the equivalent circuit it will be modelled by an L-network consisting of one element of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dZ&lt;/math&gt; and one of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dY&lt;/math&gt;; the remainder is given by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This results in the network shown in figure 3, which can be analysed for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; using the usual [[network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]] theorems,&lt;ref&gt;Porges, pp.216-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \delta Z + \frac {Z_0}{1+Z_0 \delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

which re-arranges to,

:&lt;math&gt;{Z_0}^2 - Z_0 \delta Z = \frac {\delta Z}{\delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking limits of both sides

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\delta x \to 0}({Z_0}^2 - Z_0 \delta Z) = {Z_0}^2 = \frac {dZ}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

and since the line was assumed to be homogenous lengthwise,

:&lt;math&gt;{Z_0}^2 = \frac {Z}{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

==Propagation constant==
[[File:calculation of transmission line propagation constant.svg|thumb|400px|'''Fig. 4.''' Each infinitesimal section of the transmission line causes an infinitesimal drop in the line voltage as it is propagated along the line.  [[Integral|Integrating]] these drops enables the propagation constant to be found.]]
The ratio of the line input voltage to the voltage a distance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta x&lt;/math&gt; further down the line (that is, after one section of the equivalent circuit) is given by a standard [[voltage divider]] calculation.  The remainder of the line to the right, as in the characteristic impedance calculation, is replaced with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.609-611.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{x1}} = \frac{\delta Z+\frac{Z_0 /\delta Y}{Z_0+1/\delta Y}}{\frac{Z_0 /\delta Y}{Z_0+1/\delta Y}} 
= 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y&lt;/math&gt;

Each infinitesimal section will multiply the voltage drop by the same factor.  After &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt; sections the voltage ratio will be,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{xn}} = \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y \right)^n&lt;/math&gt;

At a distance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt; along the line, the number of sections is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x/\delta x&lt;/math&gt; so that,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{xn}} = \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y \right)^{\frac{x}{\delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta x \to 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{xn}} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y \right)^{\frac{x}{\delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The second order term &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta Z \delta Y &lt;/math&gt; will disappear in the limit, so we can write without loss of accuracy,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} \right)^{\frac{x}{\delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;

and comparing with the mathematical identity,

:&lt;math&gt;e^x \equiv \lim_{p \to \infin} (1+1/p)^{px}&lt;/math&gt;

yields,

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm i = V_x e^{\frac{Z}{Z_0}x}&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of [[propagation constant]],

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm i = V_x e^{\gamma x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{Z}{Z_0} = \sqrt {ZY}&lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==

===Ideal transmission line ===
An ideal transmission line will have no loss, which implies that the resistive elements are zero.  It also results in a purely real (resistive) characteristic impedance.  The ideal line cannot be realised in practice, but it is a useful approximation in many circumstances.  This is especially true, for instance, when short pieces of line are being used as circuit components such as [[stub (electronics)|stubs]].  A short line has very little loss and this can then be ignored and treated as an ideal line.  The secondary constants in these circumstances are;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = i \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Twisted pair===
Typically, [[twisted pair]] cable used for audio frequencies or low data rates has line constants dominated by ''R'' and ''C''.  The dielectric loss is usually negligible at these frequencies and ''G'' is close to zero.  It is also the case that, at a low enough frequency, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R \gg \omega L&lt;/math&gt; which means that ''L'' can also be ignored.  In those circumstances the secondary constants become,&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx \sqrt {i\omega CR}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx \sqrt \frac{\omega CR}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \approx \sqrt \frac{\omega CR}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \approx \sqrt \frac{R}{i\omega C} = \sqrt \frac{R}{2\omega C} - i \sqrt \frac{R}{2\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

The attenuation of this cable type increases with frequency, causing distortion of waveforms.  Not so obviously, the variation of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; with frequency also causes a distortion of a type called [[dispersion relation|dispersion]].  To avoid dispersion the requirement is that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  However, it is actually proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt \omega&lt;/math&gt; and dispersion results.  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; also varies with frequency and is also partly reactive; both these features will be the cause of [[Reflections on copper lines|reflections]] from a resistive line termination.  This is another undesirable effect.  The [[nominal impedance]] quoted for this type of cable is, in this case, very nominal, being valid at only one spot frequency, usually quoted at 800&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.612-613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porges, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-axial cable===
Cable operated at a high enough frequency (VHF radio frequency or high data rates) will meet the conditions &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R \ll \omega L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G \ll \omega C&lt;/math&gt;.  This must eventually be the case as the frequency is increased for any cable.  Under those conditions ''R'' and ''G'' can both be ignored (except for the purpose of calculating the cable loss) and the secondary constants become;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx i \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx \frac{LG+RC}{2\sqrt{LC}} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(Z_0 G + \frac{R}{Z_0}\right) \approx \frac{R}{2Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \approx \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \approx \sqrt \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Loaded line===
[[Loading coil#Krarup cable|Loaded lines]] are lines designed with deliberately increased inductance. This is done by adding iron or some other magnetic metal to the cable or adding coils. The purpose is to ensure that the line meets the [[Heaviside condition]], which eliminates distortion caused by frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion, and ensures that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; is constant and resistive. The secondary constants are here related to the primary constants by;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt {RG} + i \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha  = \sqrt {RG}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt \frac{L}{C} = \sqrt \frac{R}{G}&lt;/math&gt;

==Velocity==

The velocity of propagation is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; v = \lambda f .&lt;/math&gt;

Since,

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = 2 \pi f &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac {2 \pi}{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

then,

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac {\omega}{\beta} .&lt;/math&gt;

In cases where {{math|''β''}} can be taken as,

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = \omega \sqrt {LC} &lt;/math&gt;

the velocity of propagation is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; v = {1 \over \sqrt {LC}} .&lt;/math&gt;

The lower the capacitance the higher the velocity.  With an air dielectric cable, which is approximated to with low-loss cable, the velocity of propagation is very close to ''c'', the speed of light ''in vacuo''.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp. 10, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baltimore]]-based '''Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS)''', not to be confused with the better-known [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, was among the several centers for research in the mathematical and physical sciences established throughout the United States after World War II, in recognition of the critical role that fundamental scientific research played in the outcome of that war. Although not as well known as other similar institutes, such as the IAS mentioned above, or the [[RAND Corporation]], it nevertheless made significant contributions to the sciences of systems and control theory, and various branches of mathematics, during its 18-year existence.&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, E, Conquest of Gravity Aim of Top Scientists in U.S., ''New York Harold Tribune'', (November 20, 1955), pp. 1, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Institute for Advanced Studies (sometimes referred to in the singular) was founded in 1955 by George Bunker of the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], the ancestor of the aerospace giant [[Lockheed Martin]]. Its founding was the idea of George Bunker, who took over from Glenn Martin as chairman of that company in 1952. Like the leaders of other aircraft companies in the United States, Bunker recognized that the future of aviation lay in applying new ideas of fundamental research in mathematics, electronics, and physics that had been developed during World War II. Bunker established the Institute in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, specifically chartered to support fundamental research. The RIAS's first Director was Welcome W. Bender.&lt;ref name=Harwood&gt;William B. Harwood, ''Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin-Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements'', (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute distinguished itself as one of the world's leading centers of mathematical research, especially in [[Control theory|control]] and [[systems theory]]. Among the mathematicians on its staff were [[Solomon Lefschetz]] and [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (who while at the Institute in 1960 published a famous paper that was the basis for the "[[Kalman Filter]]," a technique for extracting information from a noisy channel that finds applications in many facets of modern life), as well as [[Joseph P. LaSalle]] (who in 1960 published a paper describing [[LaSalle's invariance principle]]), [[Jack K. Hale]], [[Harold J. Kushner]] and others. While at RIAS in the early 1960s, [[Rod Driver|Rodney Driver]] undertook research on [[delay differential equation]]s and their applications.

The RIAS changed its name and turned its mission away from basic research in 1973, after the merger that produced the [[Martin Marietta]] Corporation.&lt;ref name=Harwood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Marietta Corporation Site|url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/brownfields/Martin_Marietta_corp.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scale factor''' is used in [[computer science]] when a real world set of numbers needs to be represented on a different scale in order to fit a specific [[Computer numbering formats|number format]]. For instance, a 16 bit [[signedness|unsigned]] [[integer]] (''uint16'') can only hold a value as large as 65,535&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. If uint16's are to be used to represent values from 0 to 131,070&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, then a scale factor of 1/2 would be introduced. Notice that while the scale factor extends the range, it also decreases the [[Precision (computer science)|precision]]. In this example, for instance, the number 3 could not be represented because a stored ''1'' represents a real world 2, and a stored ''2'' represents a real world 4.

==Uses==
Certain number formats may be chosen for an application for convenience in programming, or because of certain advantages offered by the hardware for that number format. For instance, early processors did not natively support the [[IEEE]] [[Floating_point|floating point standard]] for representing fractional values, so integers were used to store representations of the real world values by applying a scale factor to the real value. By necessity, this was done in [[software]], since the hardware did not support fractional value.

==Operations on Scaled Values==
Once the scaled representation of a real value is stored, the scaling can '''''often''''' be ignored until the value needs to come back into the "real world". For instance, adding two scaled values is just as valid as unscaling the values, adding the real values, and then scaling the result, and the former is much easier and faster. For other operations, however, the scaling is very important.

Multiplication, for instance, needs to take account of the fact that both numbers are scaled. As an example, consider two real world values ''A'' and ''B''. The real world multiplication of these real world values is:
&lt;pre&gt;A * B = P
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now suppose we're storing the values with a scale factor of ''Z''. If we simply multiply the stored representations we'll get the following:
&lt;pre&gt;AZ * BZ = Q
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note how ''AZ'' is the scaled real world value of ''A'' or simply the product of ''A * Z'', and likewise, ''BZ'' is the scaled representation of ''B''. Also note that we didn't write ''PZ'' as the answer, the reason is simple: PZ is ''not'' the answer. You can see this by rearranging the statement, where each line in the following is equivalent:
&lt;pre&gt;AZ * BZ = Q
A * Z * B * Z = Q
(A * B) * Z * Z = Q
P * Z * Z = Q
PZ * Z = Q
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note how we substituted ''P'' for ''A * B'' on line 4. You can now see that the result of ''AZ * BZ'' (which is ''Q'') is NOT ''PZ'', it's ''PZ * Z''. If ''PZ'' '''''were''''' the answer, we could simply store it directly, since it has the scale factor built in, as is the case with addition and subtraction. For multiplication, however, you can see that the product of two scaled values has an extra scaling built in. As long as this is taken into account, there's still no need to convert ''AZ'' and ''BZ'' into ''A'' and ''B'' before performing the operation, you just need to divide the result by ''Z'' before storing it back. You will then have ''PZ'' stored as the result of the multiplication, which is fine because you weren't storing the result of ''AZ * BZ'', you were storing the scaled representation of the result of ''A * B''.

==Common Scaling Scenarios==
===Fractional Values Scaled to Integers===
As already mentioned, many older processors (and possibly some current ones) do not natively support fractional mathematics. In this case, fractional values can be scaled into integers by multiplying them by ten to the power of whatever decimal precision you want to retain. In other words, if you want to preserve ''n'' digits to the right of the decimal point, you need to multiply the entire number by 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. (Or if you're working in binary and you want to save ''m'' digits to the right of the [[binary point]], then you would multiply the number by 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, or alternately, [[bit shift]] the value ''m'' places to the left). For example, consider the following set of real world fractional values:
&lt;pre&gt;15.400, 0.133, 4.650, 1.000, 8.001
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how they all have ''3'' digits to the right of the decimal place. If we want to save all of that information (in other words, not lose any [[Precision (computer science)|precision]]), we need to multiply these numbers by 10&lt;sup&gt;''3''&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1,000, giving us integer values of:
&lt;pre&gt;15400, 133, 4650, 1000, 8001
&lt;/pre&gt;
(also note that these numbers cannot be stored in 8bit integers, it will require at least 14 bits, or, more realistically, 16.)

===Integer values to Fractional===
Certain processors, particularly [[Digital signal processor|DSPs]] common in the [[embedded system]] industry, have built in support for the [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] arithmetic, such as [[Q (number format)|Q]] and [[IQ (number format)|IQ]] formats.

Since the fractional part of a number takes up some bits in the field, the range of values possible in a fixed point value is less than the same number of bits would provide to an integer. For instance, in an 8 bit field, an unsigned integer can store values from &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 255]&lt;/nowiki&gt; but an unsigned fixed point with 5 fractional bits only has 3 bits left over for the integer value, and so can only store integer values from &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 7]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (note that the ''number'' of values that the two fields can store is the same, 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256, because the fixed point field can also store 32 fractional values for each integer value). It is therefore common that a scaling factor is used to store real world values that may be larger than the maximum value of the fixed point format.

As an example, assume we are using an unsigned 8 bit fixed point format with 4 fractional bits, and 4 integer bits. As mentioned, the highest integer value it can store is 15, and the highest mixed value it can store is 15.9375 (0xF.F or 1111.1111&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;). If the real world values we want to manipulate are in the range [0,160], we need to scale these values in order to get them into fixed point. Note that we ''can not'' use a scale factor of 1/10 here because scaling 160 by 1/10 gives us 16, which is greater than the greatest value we can store in our fixed point format. 1/11 will work as a scale factor, however, because 160/11 = 14.5454... which fits in our range. Let's use this scale factor to convert the following real world values into scaled representations:
&lt;pre&gt;154, 101, 54, 3, 0, 160
&lt;/pre&gt;
Scaling these with the scale factor (1/11) gives us the following values:
&lt;pre&gt;154/11 = 14
101/11 = 9.1818...
54/11 = 4.9090...
3/11 = 0.2727...
0/11 = 0
160/11 = 14.5454...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note however, that many of these values have been truncated because they contain repeating fractions. When we try to store these in our fixed point format, we're going to lose some of our precision (which didn't seem all that precise when they were just integers). This is an interesting problem because we said we could fit 256 different values into our 8 bit format, and we're only trying to store values from a range with 161 possible values (0 through 160). As it turns out, the problem was our scale factor, 11, which introduced unnecessary precision requirements. The resolution of the problem is to find a better scaling factor. For more information, [[#Picking a Scale Factor|read on]].

==Picking a Scale Factor==
An example above illustrated how certain scale factors can cause unnecessary precision loss. We will revisit this example to further explore the situation.

We're storing representations of real data in 8 bit unsigned fixed point fields with 4 integer bits and 4 fractional bits. This gives us a range of &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 15.9375]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in decimal, or &lt;nowiki&gt;[0x0.0, 0xF.F]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in [[hexadecimal|hex]]. Our real world data is all integers and in the range [0, 160] in decimal. Note that there are only 161 unique values that we may want to store, so our 8 bit field should be plenty, since 8 bits can have 256 unique configurations.

In the example given [[#Integer values to Fractional|above]], we picked a scale factor of 11 so that all the numbers would be small enough to fit in the range. However, when we began scaling the following real world data:
&lt;pre&gt;154, 101, 54, 3, 0, 160
&lt;/pre&gt;
We discovered that the precision of these fractions is going to be a problem. The following box illustrates this showing the original data, its scaled decimal values, and the binary equivalent of the scaled value.
&lt;pre&gt;154/11 = 14 = 1110.0
101/11 = 9.1818... = 1001.00101110...
54/11 = 4.9090... = 100.111010...
3/11 = 0.2727... = 0.010010...
0/11 = 0 = 0.0
160/11 = 14.5454... = 1110.10010...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how several of the binary fractions require more than the 4 fractional bits provided by our fixed point format. To fit them into our fields, we would simply truncate the remaining bits, giving us the following stored representations:
&lt;pre&gt;1110.0000
1001.0010
0100.1110
0000.0100
0000.0000
1110.1001
&lt;/pre&gt;
Or in decimal:
&lt;pre&gt;14.0
9.125
4.875
0.25
0.0
14.5625
&lt;/pre&gt;
And when we need to bring them back into the real world, we need to divide by our scale factor, 1/11, giving the following "real world" values:
&lt;pre&gt;154.0
100.375
53.625
2.75
0
160.1875
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how they've changed? For one thing, they aren't all integers anymore, immediately indicating that an error was introduced in the storage, due to a poor choice of scaling factor.

===Picking a better Scale Factor===
Most [[data set]]s will not have a perfect scale factor; you will probably always get some error introduced by the scaling process. However it certainly may be possible to pick a better scaling factor. For one thing, note that dividing a number by a power of two is the same as shifting all the bits to the right once for each power of two. (It's the same thing in decimal, when you divide by 10, you shift all the decimal digits one place to the right, when you divide by 100, you shift them all two places to the right). The pattern of bits doesn't change, it just moves. On the other hand, when you divide by a number that is NOT an integer power of 2, you are changing the bit pattern. This is likely to produce a bit pattern with even more bits to the right of the binary point, artificially introducing required precision. Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use a scale factor that is a power of two. You may still lose bits that get shifted right off the end of the field, but at least you won't be introducing ''new'' bits that will be shifted off the end.

To illustrate the use of powers of two in the scale factor, let's use a factor of 1/16 with the above data set. The binary value for our original data set is given below:
&lt;pre&gt;154 = 1001 1010
101 = 0110 0101
54 =  0011 0110
3 =   0000 0011
0 =   0000 0000
160 = 1010 0000
&lt;/pre&gt;
As we already knew, they all fit in 8 bits. Scaling these by 1/16 is the same as dividing by 16, which is the same as shifting the bits 4 places to the right. All that really means is inserting a binary point between the first four and last four bits of each number. Conveniently, that's the exact format of our fixed point fields. So just as we suspected, since all these numbers don't require more than 8 bits to represent them as integers, it doesn't have to take more than 8 bits to scale them down and fit them in a fixed point format.

[[File:SubsidedRoad.jpg|thumb|[[Mam Tor]] road destroyed by [[subsidence]] and [[shear stress|shear]], near [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]], [[Derbyshire]].]]
In [[engineering]], '''shear strength''' is the strength of a material or component against the type of [[Yield (engineering)|yield]] or [[structural failure]] when the material or component fails in [[Shearing (physics)|shear]]. A shear load is a [[force]] that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane that is parallel to the direction of the force. When a paper is cut with scissors, the paper fails in shear.

In [[structural engineering|structural]] and  [[mechanical engineering]], the shear strength of a component is important for designing the dimensions and materials to be used for the manufacture or construction of the component (e.g. [[beam (structure)|beams]], [[Plate (structures)|plates]], or [[Screw|bolts]]). In a [[reinforced concrete]] beam, the main purpose of [[Rebar#Stirrups|reinforcing bar (rebar) stirrups]] is to increase the shear strength.

For [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; applies
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac {\sigma_1 - \sigma_3}{2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is major principal stress and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is minor principal stress.

In general: ductile materials (e.g. aluminium) fail in shear, whereas brittle materials (e.g. cast iron) fail in tension. See [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]].

To calculate:

Given total force at failure (F) and the force-resisting area (e.g. the cross-section of a bolt loaded in shear), ultimate shear strength (&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac {F}{A} = \frac {F}{\pi r_{bolt}^2} = \frac {4F}{\pi d_{bolt}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When values measured from physical samples are desired, a number of testing standards are available, covering different material categories and testing conditions. In the US, ASTM standards for measuring shear strength include ASTM B831, D732, D4255, D5379, and D7078. Internationally, ISO testing standards for shear strength include ISO 3597, 12579, and 14130.&lt;ref&gt;S. Grynko, "Material Properties Explained" (2012), {{ISBN|1-4700-7991-7}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the design of a [[Sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage system]] can: improve habitats for [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; improve recreational facilities, because people love to be beside water; save money, because building culverts is expensive and floods cause severe financial harm.

The design of a [[green roof]] or a [[roof garden]] can also contribute to the sustainability of a [[landscape architecture]] project. The roof will help manage surface water, provide for [[wildlife]] and provide for [[recreation]].

Sustainability appears to be a new addition to the traditional [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] objectives of the design process: a structure must be solid, useful, and beautiful (''firmitas'', ''utilitas'', ''venustas''). But it can be seen as an aspect of both solidity and usefulness: an outdoor space is likely to last longer and give more usefulness to its owners if it requires low inputs of energy, water, fertiliser etc., and if it produces fewer outputs of noise, [[pollution]], [[surface water runoff]] etc. 

== Professional Practice ==
The American Society of Landscape Architects' sustainable design guidelines include the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/guidesandtoolkit.aspx|title=Sustainable Design Guides {{!}} asla.org|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* ''Public Health + Landscape Architecture:'' Health benefits of nature

* ''Community Design'': Climate change, green infrastructure, healthy and livable communities, resilient design, sustainable transportation, sustainable urban development.  

* ''Residential Design'': Improving water management, increasing water efficiency, applying ecological design, using low impact materials.
The American Society of Landscape Architects also provide a sustainability toolkit that includes economic, environmental, and social models, for projects of different scales, that can be used in practicing landscape architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/guidesandtoolkit.aspx|title=Sustainable Design Guides {{!}} asla.org|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''The DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center''' is based at the [[University of Washington|University of Washington (UW)]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Founded in 1992, DO-IT’s mission is to increase the successful participation of [[people with disabilities]] in [[postsecondary education]] and careers, in [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] ([[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[mathematics]]) fields and careers, and in [[computing]] fields and careers throughout the U.S.  It directs the national AccessSTEM program, and co-directs the national AccessComputing Alliance focused on engaging people with disabilities in computing fields.

The Center is a unit of Accessible Technology Services of UW-IT at the University of Washington, a collaboration between the College of Engineering, the College of Education and UW-IT.  Primary funding for DO-IT and its projects is provided by the [[National Science Foundation]], the State of Washington, and the [[U.S. Department of Education]].
It promotes [[accessibility]] and [[universal design]] in [[learning]] environments and instruction, including [[Web accessibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendels|first=Pamela|title=Barriers Online for Those With Disabilities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/11/cyber/articles/04disability.html|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the online Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) and by creating, collecting and distributing publications, training materials, and tutorials for use by educators and faculty throughout the U.S.

The Center works with international institutions and organizations to adapt its practices and programs for international application.  For example, the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]] has been replicated in [[Japan]] as DO-IT Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://doit-japan.org/ DO-IT Japan] Retrieved 2013-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt; a summer program hosted by the [[University of Tokyo]]. [[South Korea]], through the leadership of [[Seoul National University]] and [[Korea Nazarene University]], also hosts a similar summer study program in collaboration with the DO-IT Center.

==History==

The DO-IT Center was founded at the University of Washington in 1992 by Dr. Sheryl Burgstahler with a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Since its inception, DO-IT's mission has been to increase the successful participation of people with disabilities in postsecondary education and careers at local, regional, national (within the United States) and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, S, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ar93.html "DO-IT Center Annual Report 1992 - 1993"], DO-IT Center, 1993. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, with funding from NSF, DO-IT launched the first [[DO-IT Scholars Program]]. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) funded the DO-IT Prof project, which created professional development materials and trained faculty and academic administrators in the U.S. to more fully include students with disabilities in their courses.&lt;ref name="doit funding overivew"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/access_college.html "AccessCollege: Systemic Change for Postsecondary Institutions"], DO-IT Center.

== Programs ==
In 2006, with funding from the NSF, the DO-IT Center partnered with [[University of Washington|University of Washington's]] Department of Computer Science and Engineering to launch the AccessComputing Alliance, a nationwide program to increase the participation of people with disabilities in computing fields. In 2006, AccessComputing partners included [[Gallaudet University]] in Washington, D.C., [[Microsoft]], the NSF Regional Alliances for Persons with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (hosted by the [[University of Southern Maine]], [[New Mexico State University]] and University of Washington), and American Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing. As of 2013, 32 postsecondary institutions and organizations are partnered with AccessComputing.&lt;ref name="accesscomputing"/&gt;
The program provides summer research programs and internships open to all U.S. students.&lt;ref name="accesscomputing"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/ AccessComputing], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The DO-IT Center's programs are centered on the concept of identifying the "critical junctures" students with disabilities face on their path to postsecondary education and careers, and providing resources, projects and programs to help students successfully navigate these critical junctures (e.g., projects to develop STEM interests in students with disabilities at the "critical juncture" between high school and the transition to a four- or two-year postsecondary institution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Rachel|title=UW offers deaf, hard of hearing chance to excel at computer academy|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/UW-offers-deaf-hard-of-hearing-chance-to-excel-1243067.php|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   DO-IT programs for students include AccessComputing, AccessSTEM, the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]] (for Washington State students), postsecondary preparation activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindblom|first=Mike|title=They've A Mind To Excel -- UW's Do-It Program Prepares Disabled Students For College Science Studies|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980814&amp;slug=2766540|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=August 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work-based experiences and internships.

 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |work= |publisher=IAU/IYA2009 |date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an international programme that aim to expose very young children in under-privileged environments to [[astronomy]].

==History==

===Inception===
In 2004, [[Leiden University]] professor [[George K. Miley]] first began exploring the idea of setting up an astronomy programme to educate and inspire young children, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds. He had been awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and decided to use part of the associated funding to explore the feasibility of setting up such a programme. With considerable support and encouragement from [[Claus Madsen]] at ESO, a successful workshop was held in Germany and it was agreed that the programme was worth pursuing. Universe Awareness (UNAWE) was born.

Shortly afterwards, Carolina Ödman was appointed as the first UNAWE International Project Manager. In 2006, thanks to a grant provided by the Netherlands Minister of Education Culture and Science, Ms. van der Hoeven, the UNAWE International Office was founded at Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands. With the help of Sarah Levin as Media Coordinator, Ödman built UNAWE into a thriving global project, with a network of about 400 experts from 40 countries.

===Reach===
UNAWE became a Cornerstone project of the successful UN-ratified IAU/UNESCO International Year of Astronomy in 2009 (IYA2009). During IYA2009, thousands of UNAWE activities were organised in more than 45 countries. For example, in Venezuela, 43 teacher training sessions reached more than 1500 teachers and well over 60 000 children.

2010 saw many changes for UNAWE. Firstly, Ödman left her coordinating role with UNAWE to join the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] Next Einstein Initiative, handing over the reins to the former Global Coordinator for IYA2009, Pedro Russo. Later that year, the European Union awarded a grant of 1.9 million euros to fund a 3-year project called European Universe Awareness (EU-UNAWE), which builds on the work of Universe Awareness (UNAWE). With this grant, EU-UNAWE is now being further developed in six selected countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and South Africa.

EU-UNAWE is endorsed by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and it is now an integral part of the IAU Strategic Plan 2010–2020, which is called Astronomy for the Developing World. This is an ambitious blueprint that aims to use astronomy to foster education and provide skills and competencies in science and technology throughout the world, particularly in developing countries..

In the countable sense, a '''verse''' is formally a single [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] [[Line (poetry)|line]] in a [[poetry|poetic composition]]. However, verse has come to represent any division or grouping of words in a poetic composition, with groupings traditionally having been referred to as [[stanza]]s.

In the uncountable ([[mass noun]]) sense '''verse''' refers to  "[[poetry]]" as contrasted to [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wiktionary'', "Verse" (accessed 8 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the common unit of verse is based on [[meter (poetry)|meter]] or [[rhyme]], the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.types-of-poetry.org.uk/45-verse.htm "Verse"], "Types-Of-Poetry", Screen 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense '''verse''' is also used pejoratively in contrast to [[poetry]] to suggest work that is too pedestrian or too incompetent to be classed as poetry.

==Types of verse==
===Blank verse===
[[Blank verse]] is poetry written in regular, metrical, but unrhymed, lines, almost always composed of iambic pentameters.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
    Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
    Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of Eden, 'till one greater Man
    ....
                                              —[[John Milton]] (from [[Paradise Lost]])
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Free verse===
[[Free verse]] is usually defined as having no fixed meter and no end rhyme. Although free verse may include end rhyme, it commonly does not.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Whirl up, sea—
    Whirl your pointed pines,
    Splash your great pines
    On our rocks,
    Hurl your green over us,
    Cover us with your pools of fir.

                                              —[[H.D.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">'''Wet oxidation''' is a form of hydrothermal treatment.  It is the [[oxidation]] of dissolved or suspended components in [[water]] using [[oxygen]] as the [[oxidizer]].  It is referred to as "Wet Air Oxidation" (WAO) when [[air]] is used.  The oxidation reactions occur in [[superheated water]] at a temperature above the normal boiling point of water (100&amp;nbsp;°C), but below the critical point (374&amp;nbsp;°C).

The system must be maintained under pressure to avoid excessive evaporation of water.  This is done to control energy consumption due to the [[latent heat of vaporization]].  It is also done because liquid water is necessary for most of the oxidation reactions to occur.  Compounds oxidize under wet oxidation conditions that would not oxidize under dry conditions at the same temperature and pressure.

Wet oxidation has been used commercially for around 60 years.  It is used predominantly for treating wastewater.  It is often referred to as '''Zimpro'''  (from ZIMmerman PROcess), after Fred T. Zimmermann who commercialized it in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.siemens.com/en/about_us/legacy_brands/Pages/zimpro.aspx|title=Zimpro History|accessdate=February 2010|df=}}| archiveurl= | archivedate=2013-03-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Description==
Commercial systems typically use a [[bubble column reactor]], where air is bubbled through a vertical column that is liquid full of the hot and pressurized wastewater.  Fresh wastewater enters the bottom of the column and oxidized wastewater exits the top.  The heat released during the oxidation is used to maintain the operating temperature.

WAO is a liquid phase reaction using dissolved oxygen in water to oxidize wastewater contaminants.  The dissolved oxygen is typically supplied using pressurized air, but pure oxygen can also be used.  The oxidation reaction generally occurs at moderate temperatures of 150°-320&amp;nbsp;°C and at pressures from 10 to 220 barg.  The process converts organic contaminants to carbon dioxide, water, and biodegradable short chain organic acids.  Inorganic constituents such as sulfides and cyanides are converted to non-reactive inorganic compounds.

In the WAO reaction, complex organic molecules, including biological refractory compounds, are broken into simpler organic compounds or to a complete mineralized state (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; Simple organic compounds such as low molecular weight carboxylic acids and mineralized reaction products may be present in the WAO effluents.  Because of this, the WAO effluent generally requires post treatment prior to discharge. WAO effluents are typically readily biodegradable and exhibit high values for [[Biological oxygen demand|BOD]]:[[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] ratios.  Standard treatment techniques such as activated sludge biotreatment are typically used with WAO for complete treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Lehmann, D. Wet Air Oxidation of Difficult to Treat Pharmaceutical Waste Streams. ''Water Practice'' '''2007,''' ''2''''',''' 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catalysis|Catalyst]] can be used in the WAO system to enhance treatment and achieve a higher COD destruction.  Heterogeneous and homogenous catalysts have been used.  Heterogeneous catalysts are based on precious metals deposited on a stable substrate.  Homogenous catalysts are dissolved transition metals.  Several processes, such as Ciba-Geigy, LOPROX, and ATHOS utilize a homogenous catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Levec,J.; Albin,P. Catalytic wet-air oxidation processes: A review. ''Catalysis Today''. '''2007''', ''124'', 172-184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Luck, F. Wet air oxidation: past, present and future. ''Catalysis Today'' '''1999''', ''53'', 81-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed metal catalysts, such a Ce/Mn, Co/Ce, Ag/Ce,  have also been effective in improving the treatment achieved in a WAO system.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, A.; Marques, R.; Quinta-Ferreira, R. Catalyst based in cerium oxide for wet oxidation of acrylic acid in the prevention of environmental risks. ''Applied Catalysis'' '''2004''', ''47'', 269-279.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special type of wet oxidation process was the so-called "VerTech process" system. A system of this type operated in [[Apeldoorn]], [[Netherlands]] between 1994 and 2004. The system was installed in a below-ground pressure vessel (also called a gravity [[pressure vessel]] or GPV). The pressure was supplied by feeding the material to a reactor with a depth of {{convert|1200|m|ft}}. The deep shaft reactor also served as a heat exchanger, so no pre-heating was required. The operating temperature was about 270&amp;nbsp;°C with a pressure of about {{convert|100|bar|psi}}. The installation was eventually shut down due to operational problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava, S.K.; Tardio, J.; Prasad, J.; Folger, K.; Akolekar, D.B.; Grocott, S.C.

== Commercial Applications ==

=== Spent Caustic Treatment ===
The majority of commercial wet oxidation systems are used to treat industrial wastewater, such as [[sulfide]] laden [[spent caustic]] streams from ethylene and LPG production as well as naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics from refinery applications.

Typical classification of WAO treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Clark, M. “Wet Air Oxidation of Spent Caustic in Petroleum Refineries”, International Water Conference (IWC), San Antonio, TX, November 4–8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Low temperature WAO systems oxidize sulfides to thiosulfate and sulfate but high concentrations of thiosulfate are present in the treated effluent.  The mid temperature systems fully oxidize sulfides to sulfate and mercaptans are oxidized to sulfonic acids.  For sulfidic spent caustics, this results in a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) destruction (&gt;90%).  High temperature systems are used to oxidize organic compounds that are present in naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics.

=== Sewage Sludge Treatment ===
Almost as many systems are also used for treating [[biosolids]], in order to [[pasteurize]] and to decrease volume of material for disposal.  The thermal conditioning occurs at temperatures of 210 – 240&amp;nbsp;°C.  A 4% dry solid slurry can be processed in a WAO system where it is disinfected and the treated effluent can be dewatered to 55% dry solids using a filter press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other Applications ===
Wet air oxidation has also been used to treat a variety of other industrial process waters and wastewaters which include:
