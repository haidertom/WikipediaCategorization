'''''A'mâk-ı Hayâl''''' ("The Depths of Fantasy"), is the [[Sufi]] [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] of [[Ahmad Hilmi of Filibe]]. ''A'mâk-ı Hayâl'' is a novel, the subject of which is the Sufi [[wahdat al-wujud]] belief. Ahmad Hilmi, himself, was a strict follower of the [[wahdat al-wujud]].

In the frame story of novel, young ''Râci'', the [[protagonist]], tries to find answers to his questions about life, most of which are mainly [[ontological]] problems. He tries to find the answers in science, philosophy and religion. However he can't find any answer that satisfies him. In this point he meets ''Aynalı Baba'', who is a [[dervish]]-like [[Sufi]]. They meet every day and during their meetings, Râci falls asleep and dreams of fantastic worlds and situations. Each dream or fantasy demonstrates an aspect of Sufi thought, more specifically the [[wahdat al-wujud]].

The '''Armenian Orphan Rug''', also known as the ''' Ghazir Orphans' Rug''', is an [[Armenian carpet|Armenian styled carpet]] woven by orphans of the [[Armenian Genocide]] in [[Ghazir]], [[Lebanon]]. The carpet took eighteen months to make and was eventually shipped to the United States where it was given to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] as a gift in 1925. It was returned by the Coolidge family to the [[White House]] in 1982. Its most recent public display was in November 2014 at the [[White House Visitors Office|White House Visitors' Center]] as part of the exhibition "Thank you to the United States: Three Gifts to Presidents in Gratitude for American Generosity Abroad".

==History==
Due to the [[Armenian Genocide]], thousands of orphans and refugees were resettled in the Middle East and placed in orphanages throughout the region. One hundred thousand orphans were assisted by [[Near East Foundation|Near East Relief]], an American-led relief organization.&lt;ref name=washington&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennicott|first1=Philip|authorlink=Philip Kennicott|title=Armenian Orphan Rug Remains in White House Storage, As Unseen As Genocide is Neglected|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/armenian-orphan-rug-remains-in-white-house-storage-as-unseen-as-genocide-is-neglected/2013/10/21/90458518-3a6d-11e3-b6a9-da62c264f40e_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An orphanage run by Near East Relief in Ghazir, Lebanon, housed many such orphans. In the early 1920s, as a token of appreciation for Near East Relief having protected them, four hundred orphaned girls wove a carpet over the course of 18 months.&lt;ref name=washington /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freking|first1=Kevin|title=Symbol Of Armenian Century-Old Suffering Gets Brief Display At White House|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/armenian-genocide-white-house_n_6182136.html|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weekly1 /&gt; It was intended as a gift to the United States, and was formally presented to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] on December 4, 1925.&lt;ref name=gazzar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gazzar|first1=Brenda|title=Local Armenians Proud 'Orphan Rug' will be displayed at White House Visitor Center|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20141023/local-armenians-proud-orphan-rug-will-be-displayed-at-white-house-visitor-center|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A label on the back of the rug reads, "In Golden Rule Gratitude to Coolidge". This is a reference to the "Golden Rule" campaign: each year, on the first Sunday in December, people in the United States were asked to eat only a one-course meal and contribute the money saved to the Near East Relief.&lt;ref name=asbarez /&gt;

After his presidential term ended in 1929, the carpet was taken to his home in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=gazzar /&gt;&lt;ref name=weekly1 /&gt; The rug lay in the living room of his house until his death in 1933, after which Mrs. Coolidge kept the rug in her home in Northampton until her death in 1957. After a period in storage, the Coolidge family returned the rug to the White House in 1982, where it was placed in storage, not on public display.&lt;ref name=weekly1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gazzar /&gt;

The carpet contains designs that may depict scenes from the [[Adam and Eve]] story.&lt;ref name=washington /&gt;&lt;ref name=weekly1 /&gt; The rug measures 11 feet 7 inches by 18 feet 5 inches (3.53 m by 5.61 m), and contains over four million hand-woven knots.&lt;ref name=doyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Richard|title=Armenian Orphan Rug, steeped in controversy, may go on display|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-armenian-rug-white-house-20140430-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazzar /&gt; The rug features lions, unicorns, eagles, and birds as part of its overall design.&lt;ref name=doyle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doyle|first1=Michael|title=Armenian Orphan Rug, symbol of tragic past, is briefly on view|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/11/18/247266/armenian-orphan-rug-symbol-of.html|agency=McClatchy Washington Bureau|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the carpet is a medallion-shaped design.&lt;ref name=weekly1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vartabedian|first1=Tom|title=Armenian Orphan Rug Lives up to Its Name|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2010/07/21/armenian-orphan-rug-lives-up-to-its-name/|newspaper=[[Armenian Weekly]]|date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
The Armenian Orphan Rug was removed from storage in 1984 and 1995.&lt;ref name=doyle /&gt; In 1995, it was temporarily removed from the storage room of the White House to show it to Vartoohi Galezian, one of its original weavers, and her family.&lt;ref name=simon/&gt; However, it wasn't publicly displayed.&lt;ref name=simon /&gt;

In January 2013, Paul Michael Taylor, director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Asian cultural history program, held preliminary discussions with White House curator William G. Allman about the possibility of displaying the rug at the Smithsonian on December 16, 2013, as part of an event sponsored by the Armenian Rugs Society and the Armenian Cultural Foundation, which would include a book launch for Hagop Martin Deranian's ''President Calvin Coolidge and the Armenian Orphan Rug''.&lt;ref name=washington/&gt; The proposal was later backed by a letter signed by a bipartisan group of 33 U.S. Congressmen supporting the removal of the rug from storage.&lt;ref name=relic/&gt; But on September 12, Taylor cancelled the event, citing the White House's decision to decline the requested loan of the rug as the reason.&lt;ref name=washington/&gt;

The White House had not offered an explanation to Taylor for its refusal to lend the carpet, and Taylor did not want to speculate on the reason. However others speculated that the decision not to loan the carpet was fear of negative reaction from Turkey. US Congressman [[Adam Schiff]] (D-California) said in an interview, "It's hard for me to reach any conclusion but that they don't want to offend Turkey. If that's their motivation, that's completely unacceptable".&lt;ref name=relic&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael|last=Doyle|title=The Armenian Orphan Rug: A relic or an insult?|publisher=McClatchy Washington Bureau|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 30, 2014|url=http://www.accc.org.uk/the-armenian-orphan-rug-a-relic-or-an-insult/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armenian National Committee of America]] linked the refusal to loan the carpet to President [[Barack Obama]]'s position on the Armenian Genocide, citing his refusal to officially recognize the Genocide, his blocking of Congressional legislation to mark the event, his Solicitor General's opposition to efforts in U.S. courts to allow American citizens to pursue Genocide-era property claims, and his administration's sending of senior officials to speak at events organized by Armenian Genocide deniers while refusing to attend Congressional observances of the Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Armenian National Committee of America|title=ANCA Rallies Against White House Decision to Block Smithsonian Display of Armenian Genocide Orphan Rug (Press release)|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=November 30, 2014|url=http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=2328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2013, the White House responded to the allegations. Laura Lucas Magnuson, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said, "Displaying the rug for only half a day in connection with a private book launch event, as proposed, would have been an inappropriate use of U.S. government property, would have required the White House to undertake the risk of transporting the rug for limited public exposure, and was not viewed as commensurate with the rug's historical significance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Richard|title=White House urged to display Armenian Orphan Rug commemorating genocide|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-armenian-genocide-rug-20131112-story.html|agency=LA Times|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House also said that the decision to keep the rug in storage "does not preclude" the possibility that it might be displayed sometime in the future.&lt;ref name=relic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Boyer|title=Obama won't acknowledge Armenian genocide by Turkey, protesters say|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 30, 2014|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/25/obama-wont-acknowledge-armenian-genocide-turkey/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian Orphan Rug was displayed at the [[White House Visitors Office|White House Visitor Center]] in November 2014 as part of the temporary exhibition "Thank you to the United States: Three Gifts to Presidents in Gratitude for American Generosity Abroad".&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hansen|first1=Matt|title=Historic rug woven by Armenian orphans goes on display at White House Visitor Center|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asbarez&gt;{{cite news|title=Armenian Orphan Rug Goes on Display at White House Visitor Center|url=http://asbarez.com/128978/armenian-orphan-rug-goes-on-display-at-white-house-visitor-center/|newspaper=[[Asbarez]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition displayed three objects gifted to America as a response to American aid after international catastrophes: the Armenian Orphan Rug; a French vase presented to President [[Herbert Hoover]] after World War I; and Japanese cherry and dogwood blossoms encased in acrylic, given to President Obama.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt; The display caption for the rug was criticized for avoiding mention of the Armenian Genocide, and failing to explain "who these orphans were, where they were from, why were they orphaned, who made them orphans, or what was done (or not done) to set things right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White House avoids mention of Armenian Genocide in Armenian Orphan Rug description|url=http://www.armradio.am/en/2014/11/19/white-house-avoids-mention-of-armenian-genocide-in-armenian-orphan-rug-description/|agency=[[Public Radio of Armenia]]|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and recognition==
President [[Calvin Coolidge]]:&lt;ref name=weekly1 /&gt;
{{quote|This beautiful rug woven by children in Lebanon has been received. This, their expression of gratitude for what we’ve been able to do for this country for their aid, is accepted by me as a token of their goodwill to the people of the United States who have assisted in the work of the Near East Relief. Please extend to these orphans my thanks and the thanks of the vast number of our citizens whose generosity this labor of love is intended to acknowledge. The rug has a place of honor in the White House where it will be a daily symbol of goodwill on earth.}}

Congressman [[Frank Pallone]]:&lt;ref name=asbarez1 /&gt;
{{quote|The White House has taken an important step in recognizing historical accuracy by displaying the Armenian orphan rug. The rug was presented to President Coolidge on behalf of the Armenian people to honor the U.S. assistance provided during the Armenian genocide. As a result, this cultural treasure has become a symbol of the strong and historic ties between the United States and Armenia. I sent a letter to President Obama urging him to allow this unique gift to go on display in a place where all Americans could view it. I believe that past attempts to keep this rug behind closed doors were fueled by the Turkish government’s desire to prevent any further dialogue about the Armenian Genocide. It is my hope that the rug’s exhibition will facilitate academic discourse and allow the American people to reflect on our positive role during a dark period of history.}}

{{quote|The Ghazir Rug is not just a carpet; it is a tangible connection to the first genocide of the Twentieth Century – a silent, beautiful rebuttal to those who deny the murder of 1.5 million men, woman and children in a campaign of mass murder, forced marches, rape and looting that befell the Armenian people from 1915-23. As the world prepares to commemorate the centennial of the genocide, the Ghazir Rug brings to life the shattered families and the mass inhumanity that was visited upon the Armenian people. And I hope that it can serve to educate a new generation of Americans about one of the great tragedies of history and leads to a redoubling of efforts in 2015 to finally and forever, honor the genocide of the Armenians without equivocation. One hundred years is a long time to wait and the Armenian people should not have to wait any longer.

History is replete with tragedy and barbarism, but it is also filled with stories of humanity, courage and faith. The Ghazir Rug embodies all of these and stands as a potent symbol of triumph against evil, our solidarity with the victims of persecution everywhere, and our special bond with the Armenian people.}}

Congressman [[Jim Costa]]:&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;
{{quote|The Armenian Orphan Rug not only symbolizes the terror and the struggle of the Armenian people, but also their fighting spirit.}}

Congresswoman [[Judy Chu]]:&lt;ref name=hansen /&gt;
{{quote|For the last 10 years, the Armenian American community has fought to get this rug released and displayed to the public. This is only a first step. This story reinforces why Congress must pass a resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide.}}

''Washington Post'' arts and architecture critic [[Philip Kennicott]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaafari|first1=Shirin|title=The White House says a rug gifted to Calvin Coolidge by Armenian orphans will stay in storage for now|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2013-10-25/white-house-says-rug-gifted-calvin-coolidge-armenian-orphans-will-stay-storage|agency=[[Public Radio International]]|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It's a big rug. It's a beautiful piece. It has on it many images of animals and plants and there is the sense by people who know what these images suggest, that it represents probably the garden of Eden.}}

[[File:E. D. Babbitt.png|thumb|Edwin Dwight Babbitt an early proponent of Chromotherapy]]
'''Chromotherapy''', sometimes called '''color therapy''', '''colorology''' or '''cromatherapy''', is an [[alternative medicine]] method, which is considered [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromotherapists claim to be able to use [[light]] in the form of [[color]] to balance "energy" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels.

Color therapy is distinct from other types of [[light therapy]], such as [[Neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice treatment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1108807 |pmc=1545706 |year=1975 |author1=Dobbs |first1=R.

J. |doi=10.1136/adc.50.11.833}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blood irradiation therapy]] which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions,&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; and from [[photobiology]], the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms. The potential risk of retinal damage linked to chromotherapy has been discussed by French skeptic and lighting physicist Sébastien Point. Although Point considers that LED lamps at domestic radiance are safe in normal use for the general population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/shouldnt-afraid-leds/|title=Why you shouldn't be afraid of LEDs - European Scientist|author=|date=1 February 2018|website=europeanscientist.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  Some evidence that white LEDs are toxic for Human at domestic radiance?, Radioprotection, september 2017 , https://www.radioprotection.org/articles/radiopro/abs/2017/04/radiopro170025/radiopro170025.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.&lt;ref&gt;S.Point, the danger of chromotherapy, Skeptical Inquirer, Vol.41, N°4, July/August 2017 skepdigest.awardspace.us/The_Danger_of_Chromotherapy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrp.asso.fr/medias/sfrp/documents/Divers/Fiche%20lampes%20%C3%A0%20Led%20SFRP%20-%20Anglais%20_%2006-2018%20(2).pdf S.

== History ==
[[Avicenna]] (980–1037), seeing color as of vital importance both in [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and in [[Therapy|treatment]], discussed chromotherapy in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. He wrote that "color is an observable symptom of disease" and also developed a chart that related color to the [[temperature]] and physical condition of the body. His view was that red moved the blood, blue or white cooled it, and yellow reduced muscular pain and inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ecam/neh137 |pmid=16322805 |pmc=1297510 |year=2005 |author1=Azeemi |first1=S. T. |title=A Critical Analysis of Chromotherapy and Its Scientific Evolution |journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=481–488 |last2=Raza |first2=S. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Civil War General [[Augustus Pleasonton]] (1801–1894) conducted his own experiments and in 1876 published his book ''The Influence Of The Blue Ray Of The Sunlight And Of The Blue Color Of The Sky'' about how the color [[blue]] can improve the growth of crops and livestock and can help heal diseases in humans. This led to modern chromotherapy, influencing scientist Dr. Seth Pancoast (1823–1889) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt (1828–1905) to conduct experiments and to publish, respectively, ''Blue and Red Light; or, Light and Its Rays as Medicine'' (1877) and ''The Principles of Light and Color''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Paul. (2001). ''Banvard's Folly: Tales of Renowned Obscurity, Famous Anonymity, and Rotten Luck''. Picador. p. 229. {{ISBN|0-330-48689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Indian-born American-citizen scientist [[Dinshah P. Ghadiali]] (1873–1966), published ''The Spectro Chromemetry Encyclopaedia'', a work on color therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, Joe. [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/spectro.html "Colorful Nonsense: Dinshah Ghadiali and His Spectro-Chrome Device"]. Quackwatch.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghadiali claimed to have discovered why and how the different colored rays have various therapeutic effects on organisms. He believed that colors represent chemical potencies in higher octaves of vibration, and for each organism and system of the body there is a particular color that stimulates and another that inhibits the work of that organ or system. Ghadiali also thought that by knowing the action of the different colors upon the different organs and systems of the body, one can apply the correct color that will tend to balance the action of any organ or system that has become abnormal in its functioning or condition. Dinshah P. Ghadiali's son Darius Dinshah continues to provide information about color therapy via his Dinshah Health Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing non-pharmaceutical home color therapy, and his book ''Let There Be Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dinshah | first=Darius | title=Let There be Light | isbn=978-0933917309 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5wBLPwAACAAJ | year=2012 | publisher=Dinshah Health Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] had described Ghadiali as "perhaps the greatest quack of them all". In 1925, Ghadiali was accused of rape and arrested in Seattle and sentenced under the [[Mann Act]] for five years at the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]]. According to Gardner, photographs of Ghadiali at work in his laboratory are "indistinguishable from stills of a grade D movie about a mad scientist".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. pp. 211-212. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century "color healers" claimed colored glass filters could treat many diseases including [[constipation]] and [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Gruson | first = L | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/science/color-has-a-powerful-effect-on-behavior-researchers-assert.html?&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Color has a powerful effect on behavior, researchers assert | date = 1982-10-19 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colored chakras==
[[File:Chakra silhouette.png|thumb|100px|A New Age conceptualisation of the chakras of Indian body culture and their positions in the human body]]

Practitioners of [[ayurvedic medicine]] believe the body has seven "[[chakra]]s", which some claim are 'spiritual centers', and which are held to be located along the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. [[New Age]] thought associates each of the chakras with a single color of the visible light spectrum, along with a function and organ or bodily system. According to this view, the chakras can become imbalanced and result in physical diseases, but application of the appropriate color can allegedly correct  such imbalances.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = D | year = 2001 | title = Color Decoder | isbn = 978-0-7641-1887-6 | publisher = Barron's }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purported colors and their associations are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm | title = Color Psychology: How Colors Impact Moods, Feelings, and Behaviors | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[About.com]] | last = van Wagner | first = K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific reception ==

Chromotherapy is regarded by health experts as [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. (1993). ''Mystical Diets: Paranormal, Spiritual, and Occult Nutrition Practices''. Prometheus Books. pp. 256-257. {{ISBN|0-87975-761-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Jonathan. (2003). ''Quack Magic: The Dubious History of Health Fads and Cures''. Ebury Press. p. 216. {{ISBN|978-0091888091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book published by the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific evidence does not support claims that alternative uses of light or color therapy are effective in treating cancer or other illnesses".&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ades | first = Terri | year = 2009 | title = Complete Guide to Complementary &amp; Alternative Cancer Therapies | isbn = 9781604430530 | publisher = American Cancer Society | pages = 210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photobiology]], the term for the scientific study of the effects of light on living tissue, has sometimes been used instead of the term chromotherapy in an effort to distance it from its roots in Victorian [[mysticism]] and to strip it of its associations with symbolism and magic.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt; [[Light therapy]] is a specific treatment approach using high intensity light to treat specific sleep, skin and mood disorders.

The [[Assembly of Vojvodina]] adopted the Coat of arms of Vojvodina on 28 June 2002. Coat of arms is based on the historical coat of arms of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]] from the flag of [[Zemun]] National Guard from 1848. The Assembly adopted the Traditional coat of arms on 15 September 2016.&lt;ref name=freeeurope/&gt;

==Description==
The three fields of the coat of arms of Vojvodina bear the coats of arms of 3 historic regions of Vojvodina, granted in the 18th century:

*[[Bačka]]. The coat of arms of Bačka was granted by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1657-1705) in 1699. It was later (1861) retained for the [[Bács-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog County]]. In blue field on a green grass stands [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] wearing blue shirt and brown toga with golden nimbus holding in dexter a downpointed silver sword with golden hilt and in sinister a black book (Bible). The Bačka-Bodrog county was divided between [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]] after [[World War I]]. The northern part of it was later incorporated into [[Bács-Kiskun]] county of Hungary, that also uses the coat of arms with [[St. Paul]] in its dexter half.
*[[Banat]]. The golden lion rampant on red holding a sabre was the coat of arms of the [[Banat of Temeswar]] (Serbian: Tamiški Banat). It was an [[Austria]]n crown land, its governor responding directly to the Emperor, and existed from 1718, when the area was taken over from the Ottoman Empire, to 1779, when it was abolished. The coat of arms of the Tamiš Banat is derived from the oldest arms of the [[Habsburg]] family, which were: Or a lion rampant gules armed langued and crowned azure. The arms denote the land as the Emperor's personal possession (hence the lion, only without the crown, and the colours, or and gules reversed and azure excluded, or in its place), which is situated at the border with the Ottoman Empire (hence the sabre in lion's paw). The coat of arms is nowadays used only in the part of Banat in [[Vojvodina]]. The coat of arms of the part of Banat in [[Romania]] is partly based on it, too: gules over waves azure a bridge with two arched openings or wherefrom issuing a demi-lion or holding a sabre in its right forepaw. Half of the lion also appears on the arms of [[Timiş County|Timiș County]] in Romania.
*[[Srem (region)|Srem]]. The third coat of arms is that of Srem, granted in 1747 by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. The modern Croatian county of [[Vukovar-Syrmia County|Vukovar-Syrmia]] uses the same coat of arms. The three white stripes on blue, representing the three rivers of Srem: [[Bosut (river)|Bosut]], [[Sava]] and [[Danube]]. A deer rests close to a green poplar (topola) tree. The tree changed throughout history. In the original grant the tree was a cypress tree. The modern [[Croatia]]n design preferred it to make it an oak tree, which is abundant in the region and is a kind of a national symbol. Similarly, the poplar is connected to [[Serbia]] (The royal family stems from a place named [[Topola]]).

==Historical coat of arms==

The historical coat of arms of [[Serbian Vojvodina]] was adopted in 1848. In its central part is a [[Serbian cross]].

On the left and right side are a small coats of arms of the four historical regions of Serbian Vojvodina: [[Syrmia|Srem]] (upper left), [[Banat]] (upper right), [[Bačka]] (bottom left), and [[Baranja region|Baranja]] (bottom right).

On the top is a [[Crown of St. Stephen|Crown of Saint Stephen]]. The crown was placed on the coat of arms because the first intention of [[Serbs]] was to create [[Serbian Vojvodina]], which would be autonomous region within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], but since the war between [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]] started, the intention was changed into one that Serbian Vojvodina should be completely separated from the Kingdom of Hungary and directly subordinated to [[Vienna]].

On March 17, 2015, the Assembly of Vojvodina failed to meet two-thirds of votes on the legislation of parallel use of the historical coat of arms and flag from 1848.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/politika/aktuelno.289.html:539049-Demokrate-pogazile-rec-i-grb&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inkunabel.ValMax.finis.detail.jpg|thumb|A colophon printed in 1471]]

In publishing, a '''colophon''' is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication. A colophon may also be emblematic or pictorial in nature. Colophons were formerly printed at the ends of books, but in modern works they are usually located at the [[Recto and verso|verso]] of the title-leaf.

==History==
[[File:Dictionary with colophon-AO 7661-IMG 0190-black.jpg|thumb|upright|Clay tablet: dictionary with colophon indicating storage emplacement in a library. From Warka, ancient [[Uruk]], mid 1st century BC. On display at the [[Louvre]].]]
The term ''colophon'' derives from the [[Late Latin]] ''colophōn'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κολοφών (meaning "summit" or "finishing touch").&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book|contribution=colophon, ''n.''|editor=James A[ugustus] H[enry] Murray|editor-link=James Murray (lexicographer)|title=The Oxford English Dictionary: A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by the Philological Society [Vol. II, C–Czech]|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|year=1888–1893|oclc=460661449}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], an ancient city in [[Asia Minor]], after which "colophony", or [[rosin]] (ronnel), is named.

The existence of colophons can be dated back to antiquity. Zetzel, for example, describes an inscription from the 2nd century A.D., transmitted in humanistic manuscripts. He cites the colophon from Poggio's manuscript, a humanist from the 15th century:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiegg|first1=Markus|title=Scribes' Voices: The Relevance and Types of Early Medieval Colophons|journal=Studia Neophilologica|date=2016|volume=88|issue=2|pages=129–147|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, The British Library Board|language=English|issn=0039-3274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Statili(us) / maximus rursum em(en)daui ad tyrone(m) et laecanianu(m) et dom̅ &amp; alios ueteres. III.''

(''‘I, Statilius Maximus, have for the second time revised the text according to Tiro, Laecanianus, Domitius and three others.’'')

Colophons can be categorized into four groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiegg|first1=Markus|title=Scribes' Voices: The Relevance and Types of Early Medieval Colophons|journal=Studia Neophilologica|date=2016|volume=88 |issue=2|pages=129–147|series=British Library Document Supply Centre Inside Serials &amp; Conference Proceedings|publisher=Sweden: Taylor &amp; Francis|location=EBSCOhost|issn=0039-3274}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Assertive'' colophons provide the contextual information about the scribe and manuscript. ''Expressive'' colophons demonstrate the scribe's feelings and wishes. ''Directive'' colophons make the reader do something, and the ''declarative'' colophons do something with the reader.

Example of ''expressive'' colophons:

''Finit dicendo: Ludid. Quicunque scriptor scribit / Leti ut scribunt scribae.''

("He finishes saying, “Every scribe who writes has fun, for writing scribes are happy ones”.)

Example of ''directive'' colophons:

''O beatissime lector, lava manus tuas et sic librum adprehende, leniter folia turna, longe a littera digito pone''.

("O most gracious reader, wash your hands and touch the book only like this: turn the pages softly and keep your finger far away from the text".)

Example of ''directive'' and ''declarative'' colophons:

''Si quis et hunc sancti sumit de culmine galli / Hunc Gallus paulusque simul dent pestibus amplis''

("If anybody takes this book from Gall’s estate, Gall and Paulus together shall inflict the plague upon him".)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The term is also applied to [[clay tablet]] inscriptions appended by a [[scribe]] to the end of an [[Ancient Near East]] (''e.g.'', Early/Middle/Late [[Babylon]]ian, [[Assyria]]n, [[Canaan]]ite) text such as a chapter, book, manuscript, or record. The colophon usually contained facts relative to the text such as associated person(s) (''e.g.'', the scribe, owner, or commissioner of the tablet), literary contents (''e.g.'', a [[title (publishing)|title]], "catch phrases" (repeated phrases), or number of lines), and occasion or purpose of writing. Colophons and catch phrases helped the reader organize and identify various tablets, and keep related tablets together. Positionally, colophons on ancient tablets are comparable to a signature line in modern times. Bibliographically, however, they more closely resemble the [[title page#Title pages in books|imprint page]] in a modern book.

Examples of colophons in ancient literature may be found in the compilation ''The Ancient Near East: Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament'' (2nd ed., 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James B[ennett] Pritchard|editor-link=James B. Pritchard|title=The Ancient Near East: Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament: Consisting of Supplementary Materials for The Ancient Near East in Pictures and Ancient Near Eastern Texts|edition=2nd|location=Princeton, N.J.|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1969|pages=101, 305, 331, 338, 340, and 341|oclc=876082348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colophons are also found in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]], where an understanding of this ancient literary convention illuminates passages that are otherwise unclear or incoherent. Examples are [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 3:1, where a later (and incorrect) chapter division makes this verse a heading for the following chapter instead of interpreting it properly as a colophon or summary for the preceding two chapters, and [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 37:2a, a colophon that concludes the histories (''[[toledot]]'') of [[Jacob]].

An extensive study of the eleven colophons found in the book of Genesis was done by Percy John Wiseman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P[ercy] J[ohn] Wiseman|editor=D. J. Wiseman|title=Ancient Records and the Structure of Genesis: A Case for Literary Unity|location=Nashville, Tenn.|publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8407-7502-3}} The book was originally published as {{cite book|author=P[ercy] J[ohn] Wiseman|title=New Discoveries in Babylonia about Genesis|location=London; Edinburgh|publisher=[[Marshall Pickering|Marshall, Morgan &amp; Scott]]|year=1936|oclc=878558981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiseman's study of the Genesis colophons, sometimes described as the [[Wiseman hypothesis]], has a detailed examination of the catch phrases mentioned above that were used in literature of the second millennium B.C. and earlier in tying together the various accounts in a series of tablets.

In early printed books the colophon, when present, was a brief description of the printing and publication of the book, giving some or all of the following data: the date of publication, the place of publication or printing (sometimes including the address as well as the city name), the name(s) of the printer(s), and the name(s) of the publisher(s), if different. Sometimes additional information, such as the name of a proofreader or editor, or other more-or-less relevant details, might be added. A colophon might also be emblematic or pictorial rather than in words.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The normal position for a colophon was after the explicit (the end of the text, often after any index or register). After around 1500 these data were often transferred to the [[title page]], which sometimes existed in parallel with a colophon.

Colophons sometimes contained [[book curse]]s, as this was the one place in a medieval manuscript where a scribe was free to write what he wished. Such curses tend to be unique to each book.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Cynthia J. Cyrus|title=The Scribes for Women's Convents in Late Medieval Germany|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=kKE97gvmWQcC&amp;pg=PA162|location=Toronto, Ont.|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year= 2009|page=162|isbn=978-1-4426-8908-4}}.

Goodspeed|title=The Curse in the Colophon|location=Chicago, Ill.|publisher=Willett, Clark, &amp; Company|year=1935|oclc=2599686}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]] colophons grew generally less common in the 16th century. The statements of printing which appeared (under the terms of the Unlawful Societies Act 1799)&lt;ref&gt;Unlawful Societies Act 1799 ([[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1780–1800#39 Geo. 3|39 Geo. 3]], c.&amp;nbsp;79).&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[recto and verso|verso]] of the title-leaf and final page of each book printed in Britain in the 19th century are not, strictly speaking, colophons, and are better referred to as "printers' imprints" or "printer statements".

In some parts of the world, colophons helped fledgling printers and printing companies gain social recognition. For example, in early modern Armenia printers used colophons as a way to gain "prestige power" by getting their name out into the social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Sebouh D. Aslanian. (2014). Port Cities and Printers: Reflections on Early Modern global Armenian Print Culture, ''Book History 17'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of colophons in early modern Armenian print culture is significant as well because it signalled the rate of decline in manuscript production and scriptoria use, and conversely the rise and perpetuation of printing for Armenians.

With the development of the [[private press movement]] from around 1890, colophons became conventional in private press books, and often included a good deal of additional information on the book, including statements of limitation, data on paper, ink, type and binding, and other technical details. Some such books include a separate "Note about the type", which will identify the names of the primary typefaces used, provide a brief description of the type's history and a brief statement about its most identifiable physical characteristics.

Some commercial publishers took up the use of colophons, and began to include similar details in their books, either at the end of the text (the traditional position) or on the verso of the title-leaf. Such colophons might identify the book's designer, the software used, the printing method, the printing company, the typeface(s) used in the page design and the kind of ink, paper and its cotton content.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|author=Stephen Wolfram|authorlink=Stephen Wolfram|title=A New Kind of Science|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1264|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718051823/http://wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1264?firstview=1|archivedate=18 July 2014|location=Champaign, Ill.|publisher=[[Wolfram Research|Wolfram Media]]|year=2002|page=1264|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers [[Alfred A. Knopf]], the [[Folio Society]] and [[O'Reilly Media]] are notable for their substantial colophons.

The English Disco Lovers was formed on 18 September 2012&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/englishdiscolovers/info|title=English Disco Lovers Facebook info|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by four anonymous London-based friends, who were discussing the appropriation of the initials EDL from the English Defence League and "putting it to better use". Some time after that they wrote a manifesto expressing their aim to oust the existing EDL from the top of Google's and Facebook's search results, aiming to achieve this via  [[search engine optimisation]] using a website, Twitter feed, and Facebook page.

In an emailed comment to ''[[The Guardian]]'', they said:

The '''Etaples art colony''' consisted of artists working in the [[Étaples]] area of northern France at the turn of the 20th century. The colony had its heyday between 1880–1914, after which it was disrupted by World War I. Although broadly international, it was made up mainly of English-speakers from North America, Australasia and the British Isles. While some artists settled in the area, other visitors stayed only a season, or an even shorter time, as they journeyed from art colony to art colony along the coasts of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. There was no uniformity of style, although there were several shared interests. While most painters left the town in 1914, artistic activity of varied quality was continued during the war by volunteers, artists in uniform and war artists. With peace, some former residents returned to their homes and the persistence of a small colony attracted a few visitors, although little innovative work now resulted.

==First decade==
[[File:Etaples-1.jpg|thumb|The market place and Étaples town hall, shortly after the tramway was built in 1900]]

The first French artists to paint in the area were those particularly associated with [[Plein air|open air]] painting. [[Charles-François Daubigny]] retreated there from the outbreak of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, where he spent his time drawing and executed at least one oil painting of beached boats (Gallery 3). Norman-born [[Eugène Boudin]] frequently painted along the Opal Coast and spent long periods in both Étaples and at [[Berck]]. [[Henri Le Sidaner]], who was brought up in [[Dunkirk]], spent the years 1885–1894 in the town{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and represented the area in all seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1st-art-gallery.com/Henri-Eugene-Augustin-Le-Sidaner/Snowy-Evening,-Etaples.html |title=Snowy Evening, Etaples Henri Eugene Augustin Le Sidaner &amp;#124; Oil Painting Reproduction |publisher=1st-Art-Gallery.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he was joined between 1887-93 by his childhood friend Eugène Chigot (1860-1923), who shared his interest in atmospheric light and afterwards went to stay in [[Le Touquet, France|Paris Plage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertisez.com/magazine/?p=864 |title=Chigot Eugène &amp;#124; expertisez magazine |publisher=Expertisez.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 also, Eugène Vail (1857-1934), moved to Étaples and spent the winter there, lodging with his Irish friend [[Frank O'Meara]], whose letters home give us information about the colony at that time.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Amongst the other artists working there were Boudin and [[Francis Tattegrain]], several more Irish, the English [[Dudley Hardy]], the Americans [[Walter Gay]] and [[L. Birge Harrison]], and the Australian Eleanor Ritchie, whom Harrison met there and married.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} While the rest were painting tranquil figures down at the harbour or in the woods, O'Meara describes Vail as ‘painting the deck of a fishing boat in a heavy sea, life-size’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorrygallery.ie/catalogs/Cat0703.pdf |title=Gorry Gallery |publisher=Gorrygallery.ie |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was "Ready, About!", which won a first-class gold medal in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1888. In the following decade, Vail's Norwegian associate [[Frits Thaulow]] was to spend some time in Étaples while [[André Derain]] stopped there and in [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-mer]] during the summer of 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapage.noos.fr/shv2/vlam-derain.htm |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232517/http://mapage.noos.fr/shv2/vlam-derain.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of Vail's stay was equally profitable for [[William Gerard Barry]], who painted his scene of returning prawn fishers, ''Retour de la Pèche aux Crevettes'', which was also accepted at the 1888 Salon.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} At the same time, Birge Harrison was completing his painting "The Return of the Mayflower". It was to be awarded a medal at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition and, for its use of an opalescent tone particularly, is seen as a precursor of American [[Tonalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americandecorativeart.com/internalpages/inventory/pages/harrison.html |title=Moonrise On The Sea : Lovell Birge Harrison |publisher=Americandecorativeart.com |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony that was in the process of being formed in Étaples and neighbouring villages such as Trépied, a mile away on the south bank of the river [[Canche]], was in reality made up largely of English-speaking expatriates who needed to live cheaply. As [[Blanche McManus]] was to comment two decades later in the record of her travels, 'the colony has been formed by buying up, or renting, the fishermen's cottages at nominal prices and turning them into studios. Such is the popularity of art that the native fisher people importune one to be taken on for models with as much insistence as the beggars of Naples appeal to strangers for money.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellscraft.com/americanwoman/americanwoman17.html |title=Blanche McManus. The American Woman Abroad. Artists' Sketching Grounds Abroad |publisher=Kellscraft.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her account is supplemented by Jane Quigley's description of life there published in 1907. 'The usual plan is to live in rooms or studios and eat at the Hotel des Voyageurs or Hotel Joos – unpretentious hostelries with fairly good meals, served in an atmosphere of friendliness and stimulating talk. In winter the place is deserted, except by a group of serious workers who make it their home. Artists pay about twenty-five or thirty francs a week for board and rooms, and studios are cheap. Étaples has been called – and not without reason – a dirty little town, but it is healthy for all that. The artistic sense finds pleasure in its winding cobbled streets and mellow old houses and in the dark-complexioned southern looking people. Models are plentiful and pose well for a small payment, either in the studio or in the picturesque gardens that lie hidden behind the street doors. A great source of interest is the fishing fleet that comes up the estuary of the Canche to the quays where the fisher people and shrimpers live in a colony of their own. There is constant work for the sketch book, especially on Monday, when the boats go off for several days, the whole family helping the men and boys to start. All one can do amid this bewildering movement of boats putting up sail, and people bustling about with provisions, is to make hurried notes and sketches.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated0006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=DLDecArts.hdv12n03.p0006&amp;id=DLDecArts.hdv12n03&amp;isize=text |title=Decorative Arts: The craftsman: Picardy: a quiet, simple land of dreamy beauty, where artists find much to paint |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and subjects==
{{Synthesis|section|date = July 2013}}
There have been references to ''l'École d'Étaples'' in the wake of an exhibition of those who were painting locally between 1880-1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.fr/fr/sections/une/articles/peintres-8217-ecole-d |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218171851/http://www.culture.fr/fr/sections/une/articles/peintres-8217-ecole-d |archivedate=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But while many of them painted out of doors, as was the new fashion in those years, their styles were too diverse to constitute a school. They ranged from the plein-air style of [[Art colony|artists' colonies]] to the south, through [[Impressionism]] to [[Post Impressionism]]. Among some 200 individuals from three continents, subject matter was obviously varied. However, two broad tendencies can be observed in their work. One is the treatment of light, that recommended itself to those of an Impressionist tendency, such as Boudin and Le Sidaner among the French and [[Wilson Steer]] from England. In this connection, we have to thank the journalist and amateur painter [[:Fr:Édouard Lévêque|Édouard Lévêque]] for putting into words its quality and giving the coastal area it eventual name. Originally from [[Amiens]], he helped develop Le Touquet as a resort and was editor of its newspaper. The phrase 'Opal Coast' was coined in an article by him in ''Le journal de Paris-Plage'' in February 1911. "Is there", he asked, "anything natural that possesses this incessantly changing diversity of colour? Yes, the opal, that precious stone with its milky tones, projecting its series of red and green glints. So let our Côte d'Opale join company with the Côte d'Azur, the Côte d'Emeraude and the Côte d'Argent."

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The other tendency among the artists was to follow the [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] of such painters as [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] in their choice of humble everyday subjects – in the case of Étaples, the life of the fisherfolk. There are good examples in the work of the American [[Louis Paul Dessar]], who was in the town between 1886-1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.terraamericanart.org/view/people/asitem/items$0040null:193/0 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405220126/http://collections.terraamericanart.org/view/people/asitem/items%240040null%3A193/0 |archivedate=April 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Anglo-Australian [[Tudor St George Tucker]], whose first major painting, "A Picardy Shrimp Fisher", was executed in Étaples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zubans |first=Ruth |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/tucker-tudor-st-george-8870 |title=Biography – Tudor St George Tucker – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adb.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Gerard Barry's "Time Flies" and Birge Harrison's "The Return of the Mayflower", mentioned above, are works of the same tendency.

One particular focus of attention as a subject was the town's fish market, built in 1872 and now a maritime museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2p2m.org/musee_presentation.php?musee=3 |title=Bienvenue sur le site 2P2M – Patrimoine et Musées en pays du Montreuillois |publisher=2p2m.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "Fish Market, Etaples", shown in 1913 at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofexhib13nati#page/14/mode/2up/search/Etaples |title=Annual Exhibition Catalogue of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1913 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Clara S. Haggarty (1871-1958),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwahi.concordia.ca/sources/artists/displayArtist.php?ID_artist=161 |title=Canadian Women Artists History Initiative : Artist Database : Artists : HAGARTY, Clara Sophia |publisher=Cwahi.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two exhibited at the 1907 [[Royal Academy]] exhibition in England: the Australian [[James Peter Quinn]]'s "Fish Market at Étaples",  and "A corner of the market, Etaples" by the animal artist Evelyn Harke (fl.1899-1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/exhibitionofroya00roya#page/n7/mode/2up |title=The exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts, 1907 : the 139th |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etchings were also made, two of which are singled out in ''Whitman's Print Collector's Handbook'' (1918):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/whitmansprintcol011336mbp#page/n383/mode/2up/search/Etaples |title=Whitman's Print-Collector's Handbook |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Dawson]]'s aquatint "Halles aux poisons" (1911), made after a visit to the town in 1910 and now in [[Georgetown University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulib.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/guac/dawson_09/images/019.jpg |title=Image |publisher=Gulib.georgetown.edu |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Lee Hankey]]'s "Fish Market at Étaples", now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=3197645&amp;partid=1&amp;orig=/research/search_the_collection_database/advanced_search.aspx&amp;currentPage=1&amp;numpages=10 |title=The Fish Market, Etaples |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter depicts baskets of fish on display in a stone hall with two women seated in the left foreground, bending towards one another as they talk, while men walk past them carrying baskets.

The market outside was equally popular, a subject bringing together folk in their distinctive local dress which was particularly adapted to the kind of saleable genre subjects that many of these artists were producing.

Recently there has been some controversy over the authenticity of artistic portrayal of the life of fisherfolk. Nina Lübbren in particular has argued that the strategies employed in producing a work of art present a false picture and are chiefly aimed at satisfying market preconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDg9H-XVm1UC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=l%C3%BCbbren+%22performing+authenticity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJkfO-UU3e&amp;sig=O4RG3BzGSd6FLuntbv9GZrWaX_w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u0agTrTPHMaIhQfcu6nBBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rural Artists' Colonies in Europe, 1870–1910 – Nina Lübbren – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while a good deal that was produced is undeniably formulaic, there is evidence also of a social conscience in the paintings of some artists that is manifested in the depiction of their subjects. Walter Gay's "November" might perhaps be dismissed as merely picturesque, a posed portrayal of a peasant woman at the not particularly arduous task of hoeing her cabbage patch (Gallery 4). But George Clausen's depiction of the back-breaking work of "Gathering Potatoes", painted at nearby Dannes in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dderrick.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/1887_gathering_potatoes.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=Dderrick.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflects concerns that are a constant in his output of the time. It was then too that he began to distance himself from those championing Impressionist effects precisely because drawing attention principally to technique takes it away from any other motivation for choosing the subject portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dderrick.typepad.com/derrick_clausen_burkhardt/gc_technique |title=George Clausen and Thomas Derrick: GC technique |publisher=Dderrick.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Nourse]]'s "Fisher Girl of Picardy" (Gallery 2) is another case of questionable authenticity. Painted on a blustery day in 1889, it shows a girl with her head slightly turned away and gazing out to sea, while her little brother shelters behind her and wipes the tears from his eyes. Elizabeth Nourse's friend Anna Schmidt later described the circumstances: "I was with Elizabeth when she painted that girl on the Etaples Dunes – it was so cold and windy the model used to weep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=18875 |title=Fisher Girl of Picardy by Elizabeth Nourse / American Art |publisher=Americanart.si.edu |date=1915-01-03 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concern underlies those paintings that show the hazardous nature of the fisherman's work, such as Vail's "Ready, About!" mentioned above, or [[Max Bohm]]'s "At Sea" (Gallery 3). Academic success, however, now tends to bring the artist's motivation, and so the painting's ultimate aim, into question. Since Eugène Chigot's "Lost at sea"  (1891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galeriebayart.fr/Art_Contemporain/1_art_19e_berck_chigot_v2.html |title=Galerie BAYART – Art ancien et contemporain à Compiègne &amp; Paris – Ecole d'Etaples (Ecole de Berck) – Charles Roussel, Eugène Chigot, Tattegrain |publisher=Galeriebayart.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; won a first prize at the Salon when it was exhibited, it might be asked whether the picture is to be viewed as a statement meant to stir the conscience of the urban diner over his fish course or alternatively as artistic exploitation of the subject in order to flatter the viewer into the belief that he has such a conscience.

:'''a) Americans'''
The painters of two of the colony's nationalities, Americans&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesage | first = Jean-Claude | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Peintres Américains en Pas-de-Calis: la colonie d'Etaples | publisher = AMME | date = | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-904959-18-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australians,&lt;ref name=AUS&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesage | first = Jean-Claude | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Peintres Australiens à Etaples | publisher = AMME | date = | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-904959-16-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been the subject of special studies. Among the earliest Americans to visit the town were [[Walter Gay]], who was making a name for himself with Realist subjects at the time, and [[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]],{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} whose long career as a painter of young women in outside settings began with portraits of peasants in Étaples before his return to the U.S. in 1889. Another early visitor was [[Homer Dodge Martin]], who was painting on the coast between 1882-6.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} His work included a topographical view of the harbour (Gallery 3).

In 1889 the Paris-based salon genre painter, [[Elizabeth Nourse]], included the town on her tour. She created paintings there including "Milk Carrier",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/Search_Repeat.aspx?searchtype=IMAGES&amp;artist=23147 |title=Elizabeth Nourse – Auction Images and prices realized for Elizabeth Nourse |publisher=Askart.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fisher Girl of Picardy", "An Etaples Fair"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?q=record_ID:siris_ari_236827 |title=An Etaples Fair, (painting) &amp;#124; Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Collections.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Street Scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?q=record_ID:siris_ari_236828 |title=Etaples Street Scene, (painting) &amp;#124; Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Collections.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on [[E.

His "Coastal Scene, Etaples" is particularly worth noting for its interpretation of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/eanger-irving-couse-american-1866-1936-0 |title=Eanger Irving Couse (American, 1866-1936) (02/24/2008) |publisher=Worthpoint.com |date=2008-02-24 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myron Barlow (1873–1937) also had a home in Étaples from the late 1890s to his death and specialised particularly in figures in interiors. Among his students there was Norwood Hodge MacGilvary (1874–1949), who studied under him in the years 1904-6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfsfineart.com/biographies3.htm |title=American Painters – Artist Biographies M-Z |publisher=Wolfsfineart.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Bohm]] lived in the area between 1895-1904. Described as a romantic visionary, his heroic depiction of Étaples fishermen, "En Mer" (see Gallery 3), received a gold medal at the Paris Salon in 1898. He then moved out of the town to Trépied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkgvGYj34UMC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Max+Bohm++Etaples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kqhahny2Jj&amp;sig=Wo0TERQni95CPINJs80dfMaUHe0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HDaMTrLnJuOh0QWu4rW2BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Max%20Bohm%20%20Etaples&amp;f=false |title=A Legacy of Art: Paintings and Sculptures by Artist Life Members of the ... – Carol Lowrey – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while there founded the Société Artistique de Picardie which took over arranging the annual exhibitions of work by local artists started in 1892 by Eugène Chigot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTEwEyV2QhUC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22Eugene+Boudin%22+Etaples&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5_yaTo_cK8GW8QOvt8ncBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Petit Futé Côte d'Opale – Jean-Paul Labourdette – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 the society's president was George Senseney (1874-1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindapages.com/wags-ohio/gsenseney.htm |accessdate=October 5, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was listed as still living in Etaples in a catalogue of works by American etchers the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073616488#page/n43/mode/2up/search/Etaples |title=Catalogue of an exhibition of works by American etchers under the management of the Chicago Society of Etchers |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 Senseney was succeeded as president by the African-American artist [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]],&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CgtERfkp-UC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=etaples+%22artists+colony%22+Henry+Ossawa+Tanner&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xs91xkmh0k&amp;sig=Th7Qkre2N1wuU4BOQRLQVoZGsXI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NKd9TsiZN8ip0QXN3oUE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Etaples&amp;f=false |title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: American Artist – Marcia M.

Early in his career, Tanner painted marine scenes that showed man's struggle with the sea, but by 1895 he was creating mostly religious works. The simple resources at Étaples were well adapted to his subject matter, which in several cases featured Biblical figures in dark interiors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Occasionally Tanner played host at Trépied to a fellow African-American, [[William Edouard Scott]], who painted there off and on between 1910-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTG-GXlmMAEC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Etaples+artist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UcB9TtuPMseg8QPP7uGiAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Etaples%20artist&amp;f=false |title=A Shared Heritage: Art by Four African Americans – William Edward Taylor – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1969-07-27 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Tanner's son claims that he was largely responsible for establishing the foreign artistic milieu at Etaples, often entertaining up to 100 people at his Trépied summer home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CgtERfkp-UC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=%22Etaples+art+colony+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y_mTUpGrFbKX0QXO3oHIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Etaples%20art%20colony%20%22&amp;f=false |title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: American Artist – Marcia M.

Also staying in the village during this decade was Max Bohm's friend Chauncey Ryder (1868-1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raisonne.org/site/biography/22 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120115358/http://www.raisonne.org/site/biography/22 |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as he quitted the farmhouse he was renting in 1907, he was succeeded there by the landscape artist Roy Brown (1879-1956), who was to stay until war broke out in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkgvGYj34UMC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=etaples+%22artists+colony%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kqh9hrB-Mn&amp;sig=4zM4lbXdCMN_RFyArKFp0g7bHfw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yZp9Ttz0BomT0QXY7rzqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=etaples%20%22artists%20colony%22&amp;f=false |title=A Legacy of Art: Paintings and Sculptures by Artist Life Members of the ... – Carol Lowrey – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other visitors to the area included the landscapist George W. Picknell (1864–1943)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadja.com/auctions/en/picknell_george_w_/artist/106803 |title=George W.

Students were attracted into the area to study with some of these artists. Writing in 1907, Jane Quigley testified of Max Bohm that 'He attracts a following of students by his power as a teacher and the vigorous and sincere personality which exacts good work from all who come under his influence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated0006"/&gt; This was certainly so of the New Zealand artist Samuel Hales (1868-1953), whose painting "La Nuit" was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cornwallartists.org/directory/h?page=1 |title=H &amp;#124; cornwall artists index |publisher=Cornwallartists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later student was the English [[Jessica Dismorr]], who studied with Bohm in 1904 and went on to adopt a Fauvist and then a Vorticist style.

While Bohm taught in Étaples, the Australian artist [[Rupert Bunny]] did most of his teaching in Paris. But between 1893–1907 he was a frequent visitor and has left some memorable paintings, among them the atmospheric "Light on the Canche"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleneking.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/BunnyEtaples.jpg |title=Image |publisher=Charleneking.com |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Low tide at Étaples",&lt;ref&gt;[http://c48743.r43.cf3.rackcdn.com/Images/2011_01/17/0029/1096262/129397293077772021_81183350-5085-4362-b7b3-a2c9021d66ad_303767_570.Jpeg ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; both dating from 1902, the same year as "Rainy weather at Étaples" (Gallery 1). Among the students that followed him down was his fellow countrywoman Marie Tuck (1866-1947), who paid for her tuition by cleaning out his studio and came to live in Étaples between 1907–14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/marie-tuck |title=Marie Tuck biography at Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Baker-Clack]] (1877–1955), another Australian, who settled in Trépied in 1910.

The only considerable English painter connected with Étaples was [[Philip Wilson Steer]], who spent some time there in 1887. His misty Impressionist style is striking in such paintings as "The Beach" (Gallery 4) and "Fisher Children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4295575 |title=Philip Wilson Steer, O.M.

Dudley Hardy (1866–1922) captured an evening effect in a watercolour of 1888, looking from the south side of the Canche and showing the windmills that dominated the town at that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelyndacottongallery.co.uk/period_description.php?id=69 |title=Dudley Hardy |publisher=The Lynda Cotton Gallery |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora Cundell]] (1889-1948) takes us into the back parlour of the Cafe Loos, through the doorway of which one can see a few artist types at table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-back-parlour-cafe-loos-taples-france-65885 |title=The Back Parlour, Café Loos, Étaples, France |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One English artist who visited the area over many years from 1904 onwards was [[William Lee Hankey]]. Eventually he was to have a house built in Le Touquet and maintain a studio at Étaples. His paintings include land- and seascapes such as "The Harbour",&lt;ref&gt;[http://c48743.r43.cf3.rackcdn.com/Images/2009_07/05/0150/526157/a1dcd253-4fcd-4138-a51c-cba4d6da2168_g_570.Jpeg ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and figure studies like "Mother and Child"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skinnerinc.com/asp/fullCataloguese.asp?salelot=2129+++++215+&amp;refno=++456342 |title=William Lee Hankey (British, 1869-1952) Mother and Child &amp;#124; Sale Number 2129, Lot Number 215 &amp;#124; Skinner Auctioneers |publisher=Skinnerinc.com |date=2002-03-22 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Goose Girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4027211 |title=William Lee-Hankey, R.W.S.

Among the Scots, three of the four Post-Impressionist painters known as the [[Scottish Colourists]] worked in the area.

Brown was also a notable maker of prints and in 1919 published his ''Étaples: Pictures'', which included 28 tipped-in illustrations, of which ten were in colour.

Among those painters known as Irish Impressionists&lt;ref&gt;Julian Campbell, ''The Irish Impressionists'', The National Gallery of Ireland 1984&lt;/ref&gt; were the peripatetic William Gerard Barry and the short-lived Frank O'Meara, whose early visit to Étaples has already been mentioned. Another of this group was Barry's protégé Harry Scully,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpfa.ie/scully.htm |title=Irish Art Archive – Harry Scully – Milmo-Penny Fine Art |publisher=Mpfa.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stopped in the town in 1896 but was identified with many other art colonies as well. [[Sarah Cecilia Harrison]], noted for her paintings of children and landscapes, was there in 1890 and her "On the road to Étaples" was exhibited at the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1984), p.95&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 [[Edith Somerville]] was painting in the town, companioned by her friend [[Violet Florence Martin|Violet Martin]]. In this case, though, they profited from their stay by conceiving together the stories gathered in ''Some Experiences of an Irish R. M.'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tG9B6b5jFZgC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Edith+Somerville++Etaples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bgr0X9yKie&amp;sig=WcQJROvMtI9VffqB0A4FU__TT98&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y0KfTvOYDsqW8QPmlMSdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%89taples&amp;f=false |title=The Professional Literary Agent in Britain, 1880–1920 – Mary Ann Gillies – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade Edward Millington Synge (1866-1913) passed some of the winter there and executed "The Thaw, Etaples" (1909), a watercolour of a muddy lane under trees with 'pale yellow sky, purple hills, dull red roof, grey and purple roadway, all obscured by patches of half melted snow’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/internationalstu58newy#page/148/mode/2up/search/Synge |title=International studio |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted for etching, his print of a winter sunset also dates from this stay. The previous year he had married Freda Molony (1869-1924), whose name was mentioned at this period as among those painting in the town and as a successful exhibitor at the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated0006"/&gt; Among her paintings was one of "The Blessing of the Fishing Fleet" at Étaples (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/lotdetailpage.aspx?lot_id=A1A4EA751E1D0824 |title=The blessing of the fishing fleet, Etaples, Brittany by Freda Moloney on artnet |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings of religious processions were comparatively rare in the colony, but in this case Molony's Impressionist approach, with its photographic cutting off of the action by the frame, can be compared with Iso Rae's Post Impressionist treatment of the "Rogation Sunday" procession some seven years later (Gallery 6).

==Aftermath==
With the outbreak of war, the artists in the colony scattered elsewhere and the English army eventually turned the dune area at the back of the town into a vast transit camp, which in turn brought air attacks and some devastation to the town. Several hospitals were set up for those wounded in the nearby fighting and, sadly, what was to become a huge military cemetery. Just before he left the area in 1914, William Lee Hankey had time to observe the consequences for ordinary people of the German invasion of France and Belgium. Its result was the particularly striking etching of "The Refugees". He went on to serve with the [[Artists Rifles]] from 1915 to 1918 and then returned to his home in France.

Some American artists also hung on for a while. Writing in the ''New York Times'' in February 1915, the newly returned Arnold Slade gave an account of the military build-up in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/02/21/104641562.pdf |title=AMERICAN ARTIST VISITS NEW BRITISH BASE CAMP – Just Back from Etaples, France, He Tells of Vast Preparations for 1,500,000, Men.

But almost the only artist to stay on in Étaples throughout the war and record the military activity there was Iso Rae. While working for the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) of the British Red Cross between 1915-1919, she produced about 200 pastel drawings of the army camp and the life of the soldiers there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/8/articles/iso_rae.pdf |title=Iso Rae in Etaples : another perspective of war |author=Betty Snowden |publisher=Awm.gov.au |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411164433/https://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/8/articles/iso_rae.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Made in the limited time she had spare from her duties, they are of great documentary interest but differ in style from her regular work.

Another medical volunteer connected with the camp was the Yorkshireman Fred Lawson (1888–1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/sketching_a_rich_slice_of_social_history_1_2611409 |title=Sketching a rich slice of social history |publisher=Yorkshire Post |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; who painted watercolours of the town&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennants.co.uk/Catalogue/Lots/89891.aspx#image |title=Tennants Auctioneers: Frederick (Fred) Lawson (1888-1968) |publisher=Tennants.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c0728562.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/LS153813_HR.jpg |title=Image |publisher=C0728562.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few who painted among those in uniform. William McDougall Anderson (1883–1917) was a Scottish stained glass artist who served as a Lance Corporal and made a few studies while passing through Étaples in October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |year=2013 |work=IWM Collection Search |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/search?query=&amp;f%5b0%5d=makerString%3AAnderson%2C%20William%20McDougall&amp;items_per_page=50 |title=Anderson's work in the Imperial War Museum Collection |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving in the Australian army was Major Edwin Summerhayes. Originally an architect from Perth, Western Australia, he executed several watercolours of war damage in the area (and at the front) in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pictureaustralia.org/apps/pictureaustralia?term1=Major+Edwin+Summerhayes&amp;Submit=search&amp;action=PASearch&amp;attribute1=any+field&amp;mode=search |title=Australian pictures in Trove – Trove |publisher=Pictureaustralia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a view over the Canche to Paris Plage from the notorious training grounds known as the 'bull ring'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Bull Ring 2.jpg|View online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two war artists were present during the German air raid on Étaples in May 1918 which also targeted the hospitals. [[Austin Osman Spare|Austin Spare]], who was in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], recorded the scene of devastation left by the raid. A dead British soldier lies amidst hundreds of splintered planks of wood that have come from the damaged wooden huts lining the background of the composition.

Hodgson Lobley (1878–1954), also serving in the RAMC at the time, pictured men constructing an underground dug-out which would serve as a shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/16900 |year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |work=IWM Collections Search |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |title=Galleries of Large Dug-outs at Etaples (Art.IWM ART 3670)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lavery]], one of the official British war artists, had been prevented by illness from leaving the country during the war but visited Étaples in 1919. Moved by the sight of the war cemetery that was served then only by a few women VADs, before it was officially designated by the [[War Graves Commission]], he painted it in its sandy starkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/16275 |year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |work=IWM Collections Search |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |title=The Cemetery, Etaples, 1919 (Art.IWM ART 2884)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted the officers’ convalescent home over the bridge in privileged Le Touquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/16276|year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |work=IWM Collections Search |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |title=The QMAAC Convalescent Home, Le Touquet, 1919 (Art.IWM ART 2885)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many soldier poets also passed through the camp at Étaples, among them [[Wilfred Owen]], who commented unfavourably upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Snowden p.38&lt;/ref&gt; However, their preoccupation was mainly with the fighting further inland and there are few poems specifically connected with the town. Most of those we know about were from authors later noted for their prose. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] ‘wrote a poem about England’ while passing through on his way to the front in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDQusCjsL-YC&amp;pg=PT80&amp;dq=Etaples+poem+--Jacques+-Lefevre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kR-ATvmmNImq8QPOlYWDAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=J.

A few resident artists from the colony came back after the war, among them Myron Barlow, Arthur Baker-Clack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58542755 |title=HOME of BEAUTY from the RUINS of WAR. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=23 April 1927 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |page=17 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry Tanner, who had been working for the American Red Cross in France. In 1923 he was made a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] for his work as an artist – as was Barlow in 1932. Iso Rae moved out of Étaples to Trépied, where she stayed until 1932, with Tanner as a neighbour. But, as the latter's biographer records, 'life at Trépied was never to be what it had been before the war. An artists’ colony still existed...but something was missing. Many of the old crowd did not return and those who did were less in step with the times.'&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; They were no longer at the cutting edge of artistic developments and the majority had preferred to take back what they had learned and renew traditional approaches in their own countries.

[[File:Fotothek df pk 0000165 012.jpg|thumb|A film editor at work in 1946.]]

'''Film editing''' is a technical part of the [[post-production]] process of [[filmmaking]]. The term is derived from the traditional process of working with [[film stock|film]] which increasingly involves the use of digital technology.

The '''film editor''' works with the raw [[footage]], selecting [[Shot (filming)|shots]] and combines them into [[Sequence (filmmaking)|sequences]] which create a finished [[Film|motion picture]]. Film editing is described as an art or skill, the only art that is unique to cinema, separating filmmaking from other art forms that preceded it, although there are close parallels to the editing process in other art forms such as poetry and novel writing. Film editing is often referred to as the "invisible art"&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06harr.html "Which Editing is a Cut Above?"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (January 6, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; because when it is well-practiced, the viewer can become so engaged that he or she is not aware of the editor's work.

On its most fundamental level, film editing is the [[art]], technique and practice of assembling shots into a coherent sequence. The job of an editor is not simply to mechanically put pieces of a film together, cut off film [[clapperboard|slates]] or edit dialogue scenes. A film editor must creatively work with the layers of images, story, dialogue, music, pacing, as well as the actors' performances to effectively "re-imagine" and even rewrite the film to craft a cohesive whole. Editors usually play a dynamic role in the making of a film. Sometimes, auteurist [[film director]]s edit their own films, for example, [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Bahram Beyzai]] and [[Coen brothers|the Coen Brothers]].

With the advent of digital editing, film editors and their assistants have become responsible for many areas of filmmaking that used to be the responsibility of others. For instance, in past years, picture editors dealt only with just that—picture. Sound, music, and (more recently) visual effects editors dealt with the practicalities of other aspects of the editing process, usually under the direction of the picture editor and director. However, digital systems have increasingly put these responsibilities on the picture editor. It is common, especially on lower budget films, for the editor to sometimes cut in makeshift music, mock up visual effects and add temporary sound effects or other sound replacements. These temporary elements are usually replaced with more refined final elements produced by the sound, music and visual effects teams hired to complete the picture.

==History==
Early films were short films that were one long, static, and [[locked-down]] shot. Motion in the shot was all that was necessary to amuse an audience, so the first films simply showed activity such as traffic moving on a city street. There was no story and no editing. Each film ran as long as there was film in the camera.

[[File:Méliès, Un homme de têtes (Star Film 167 1898).jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot from ''[[The Four Troublesome Heads]]'', one of the first films to feature [[multiple exposure]]s.]]

The use of film editing to establish continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.&lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1896 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. One of the first films to use this technique, [[Georges Méliès]]'s ''[[The Four Troublesome Heads]]'' from 1898, was produced with Paul's camera.

The further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899-1900 at the [[Brighton|Brighton School]] in[England, where it was definitively established by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]. In that year, Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene.

[[File:Williamson Fire.ogv|thumb|left|250px|Excerpt from the movie ''Fire!'' directed by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]]]

Even more remarkable was [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'', made around the same time in 1900. The first shot shows the gate to the mission station from the outside being attacked and broken open by Chinese [[Boxer rebellion|Boxer rebels]], then there is a cut to the garden of the [[Siege of the International Legations|mission station]] where a pitched battle ensues. An armed party of British sailors arrived to defeat the Boxers and rescue the missionary's family. The film used the first "[[reverse angle]]" cut in film history.

James Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'' and ''Fire!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two filmmakers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552|title=The Brighton School|accessdate=2012-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113027/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Great Train Robbery 0018.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Scene from ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), directed by [[Edwin Stanton Porter]]]]
Other filmmakers then took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter worked on a number of minor films before making ''[[Life of an American Fireman]]'' in 1903. The film was the first American film with a plot, featuring action, and even a closeup of a hand pulling a fire alarm. The film comprised a continuous narrative over seven scenes, rendered in a total of nine shots.&lt;ref name="musser"&gt;Originally in ''Edison Films'' catalog, February 1903, 2–3; reproduced in Charles Musser, ''Before the Nickelodeon: Edwin S. Porter and the Edison Manufacturing Company'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 216–18.&lt;/ref&gt; He put a dissolve between every shot, just as [[Georges Méliès]] was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] editing method to show simultaneous action in different places.

These early film directors discovered important aspects of motion picture language: that the screen image does not need to show a complete person from head to toe and that splicing together two shots creates in the viewer's mind a contextual relationship. These were the key discoveries that made all non-live or non live-on-videotape narrative motion pictures and television possible—that shots (in this case, whole scenes since each shot is a complete scene) can be photographed at widely different locations over a period of time (hours, days or even months) and combined into a narrative whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] (1957). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' contains scenes shot on sets of a telegraph station, a railroad car interior, and a dance hall, with outdoor scenes at a railroad water tower, on the train itself, at a point along the track, and in the woods. But when the robbers leave the telegraph station interior (set) and emerge at the water tower, the audience believes they went immediately from one to the other. Or that when they climb on the train in one shot and enter the baggage car (a set) in the next, the audience believes they are on the same train.

Sometime around 1918, [[Russians|Russian]] director [[Lev Kuleshov]] did an experiment that proves this point. (See [[Kuleshov Experiment]]) He took an old film clip of a head shot of a noted Russian actor and intercut the shot with a shot of a bowl of soup, then with a child playing with a teddy bear, then with a shot an elderly woman in a casket. When he showed the film to people they praised the actor's acting—the hunger in his face when he saw the soup, the delight in the child, and the grief when looking at the dead woman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] (1957). pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the shot of the actor was years before the other shots and he never "saw" any of the items. The simple act of juxtaposing the shots in a sequence made the relationship.

===Film editing technology===
Before the widespread use of [[non-linear editing system]]s, the initial editing of all films was done with a positive copy of the film negative called a film [[workprint]] (cutting copy in UK) by physically cutting and pasting together pieces of film. Strips of footage would be hand cut and attached together with tape and then later in time, glue. Editors were very precise; if they made a wrong cut or needed a fresh positive print, it cost them money for the lab to reprint the footage and push the editing process back farther. With the invention of a splicer and threading machine with a viewer such as a [[Moviola]], or [[Flatbed editor|"flatbed" machine]] such as a K.-E.-M. or [[Steenbeck]], the editing process sped up a little bit and cut came out cleaner and more precise. The Moviola editing practice is non-linear, allowing the editor to make choices faster, a great advantage to editing episodic films for television which have very short time lines to complete the work. All film studios and production companies who produced films for television provided this tool for their editors. Flatbed editing machines,were used for playback and refinement of cuts, particularly in feature films and films made for television because they were less noisey and cleaner to work with.  
They were used extensively for documentary and drama production within the BBC's Film Department. Operated by a team of two, an editor and assistant editor, this tactile process required significant skill but allowed for editors to work extremely efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare. Collection.https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:16mm editing synchroniser 1980's 1.jpg|thumbnail|Acmade Picsynch for sound and picture coordination]]
Today, most films are edited digitally (on systems such as [[Avid Technology|Avid]], [[Final Cut Pro]] or [[Premiere Pro]]) and bypass the film positive workprint altogether. In the past, the use of a film positive (not the original negative) allowed the editor to do as much experimenting as he or she wished, without the risk of damaging the original. With digital editing, editors can experiment just as much as before except with the footage completely transferred to a computer hard drive.

When the film workprint had been cut to a satisfactory state, it was then used to make an edit decision list (EDL). The negative cutter referred to this list while processing the negative, splitting the shots into rolls, which were then contact printed to produce the final film print or [[answer print]]. Today, production companies have the option of bypassing negative cutting altogether. With the advent of digital intermediate ("DI"), the physical negative does not necessarily need to be physically cut and hot spliced together; rather the negative is optically scanned into computer(s) and a cut list is conformed by a DI editor.

=== Women in film editing ===
In the early years of film, editing was considered a technical job; editors were expected to "cut out the bad bits" and string the film together. Indeed, when the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] was formed, they chose to be "below the line", that is, not a creative guild, but a technical one. This was very helpful to women. Women were not usually able to break into the "creative" positions; directors, cinematographers, producers, and executives were almost always men. Editing afforded creative women a place to assert their mark on the film making process. The [[history of film]] has included many women editors such as [[Dede Allen]], [[Anne Bauchens]], [[Margaret Booth]], [[Barbara McLean]], [[Anne V. Coates]], [[Adrienne Fazan]], [[Verna Fields]], [[Blanche Sewell]] and [[Eda Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://via.hypothes.is/http://critics-associated.com/a-tedious-job-women-and-film-editing/|title="A Tedious Job" – Women and Film Editing|last=Galvão|first=Sara|date=March 15, 2015|website=Critics Associated via.hypothes.is|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-production ==
{{main|Post-production}}
{{see also|Rough cut|Offline editing|Online editing}}

Post-production editing may be summarized by three distinct phases commonly referred to as the [[editor's cut]], the [[director's cut]], and the [[final cut privilege|final cut]].

There are several editing stages and the editor's cut is the first. An editor's cut (sometimes referred to as the "Assembly edit" or "Rough cut") is normally the first pass of what the final film will be when it reaches [[picture lock]]. The film editor usually starts working while principal photography starts. Likely, prior to cutting, the editor and director will have seen and discussed "[[dailies]]" (raw footage shot each day) as shooting progresses. Screening dailies gives the editor a general idea of the director's intentions. Because it is the first pass, the editor's cut might be longer than the final film. The editor continues to refine the cut while shooting continues, and often the entire editing process goes on for many months and sometimes more than a year, depending on the film.

When shooting is finished, the [[Film director|director]] can then turn his or her full attention to collaborating with the editor and further refining the cut of the film. This is the time that is set aside where the film editor's first cut is molded to fit the director's vision. In the United States, under the rules of the [[Directors Guild of America]], directors receive a minimum of ten weeks after completion of principal photography to prepare their first cut. While collaborating on what is referred to as the "director's cut", the director and the editor go over the entire movie in great detail; scenes and shots are re-ordered, removed, shortened and otherwise tweaked. Often it is discovered that there are [[plot hole]]s, missing shots or even missing segments which might require that new scenes be filmed. Because of this time working closely and collaborating&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a period that is normally far longer and more intricately detailed than the entire preceding film production&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; many directors and editors form a unique artistic bond.

Often after the director has had their chance to oversee a cut, the subsequent cuts are supervised by one or more producers, who represent the production company or [[movie studio]]. There have been several conflicts in the past between the director and the studio, sometimes leading to the use of the "[[Alan Smithee]]" credit signifying when a director no longer wants to be associated with the final release.

== Methods of montage ==
{{main|Montage (filmmaking)}}
In [[motion picture terminology]], a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] (from the French for "putting together" or "assembly") is a film editing technique.

There are at least three senses of the term:
# In [[French film]] practice, "montage" has its literal French meaning (assembly, installation) and simply identifies editing.
# In [[Soviet film]]making of the 1920s, "montage" was a method of juxtaposing shots to derive new meaning that did not exist in either shot alone.
# In [[classical Hollywood cinema]], a "[[montage sequence]]" is a short segment in a film in which narrative information is presented in a condensed fashion.

Although film director [[David Wark Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] was not part of the montage school, he was one of the early proponents of the power of editing&amp;nbsp;— mastering [[cross-cutting]] to show parallel action in different locations, and codifying film grammar in other ways as well. Griffith's work in the teens was highly regarded by Kuleshov and other Soviet filmmakers and greatly influenced their understanding of editing.

[[Lev Kuleshov]] was among the very first to [[Soviet montage theory|theorize about the relatively young medium of the cinema]] in the 1920s. For him, the unique essence of the cinema&amp;nbsp;— that which could be duplicated in no other medium&amp;nbsp;— is editing. He argues that editing a film is like constructing a building. Brick-by-brick (shot-by-shot) the building (film) is erected. His often-cited [[Kuleshov Experiment]] established that montage can lead the viewer to reach certain conclusions about the action in a film. Montage works because viewers infer meaning based on context. [[Sergei Eisenstein]] was briefly a student of Kuleshov's, but the two parted ways because they had different ideas of montage. Eisenstein regarded montage as a [[dialectic]]al means of creating meaning. By contrasting unrelated shots he tried to provoke associations in the viewer, which were induced by shocks.

A [[montage sequence]] consists of a series of short shots that are edited into a sequence to condense narrative. It is usually used to advance the story as a whole (often to suggest the passage of time), rather than to create symbolic meaning. In many cases, a song plays in the background to enhance the mood or reinforce the message being conveyed. One famous example of montage was seen in the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', depicting the start of man's first development from apes to humans. Another example that is employed in many films is the sports montage. The sports montage shows the star athlete training over a period of time, each shot having more improvement than the last. Classic examples include Rocky and the Karate Kid.

== Continuity editing and alternatives ==
{{main|Continuity editing}}

Continuity is a term for the consistency of on-screen elements over the course of a scene or film, such as whether an actor's costume remains the same from one scene to the next, or whether a glass of milk held by a character is full or empty throughout the scene.  Because films are typically shot out of sequence, the [[script supervisor]] will keep a record of continuity and provide that to the film editor for reference.  The editor may try to maintain continuity of elements, or may intentionally create a discontinuous sequence for stylistic or narrative effect.

The technique of continuity editing, part of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] style, was developed by early European and American directors, in particular, [[David Wark Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] in his films such as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]''. The classical style embraces temporal and spatial continuity as a way of advancing narrative, using such techniques as the [[180 degree rule]], [[Establishing shot]], and [[Shot reverse shot]].

Early Russian filmmakers such as [[Lev Kuleshov]] further explored and theorized about editing and its ideological nature. [[Sergei Eisenstein]] developed a system of editing that was unconcerned with the rules of the continuity system of classical Hollywood that he called [[Intellectual montage]].

Alternatives to traditional editing were also explored by early [[surrealist]] and [[Dada]] filmmakers such as [[Luis Buñuel]] (director of the 1929 ''Un Chien Andalou'') and [[René Clair]] (director of 1924's ''Entr'acte'' which starred famous Dada artists [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]]).

The [[French New Wave]] filmmakers such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]] and their American counterparts such as [[Andy Warhol]] and [[John Cassavetes]] also pushed the limits of editing technique during the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s. French New Wave films and the [[non-narrative film]]s of the 1960s used a carefree editing style and did not conform to the traditional editing etiquette of Hollywood films. Like its Dada and surrealist predecessors, [[French New Wave]] editing often drew attention to itself by its lack of continuity, its demystifying self-reflexive nature (reminding the audience that they were watching a film), and by the overt use of [[jump cut]]s or the insertion of material not often related to any narrative.

Since the late 20th century [[Post-classical editing]] has seen faster editing styles with nonlinear, discontinuous action.

== Significance ==
[[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] noted that the editing process is the one phase of production that is truly unique to motion pictures. Every other aspect of film making originated in a different medium than film (photography, art direction, writing, sound recording), but editing is the one process that is unique to film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] was quoted as saying: "I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of film making. If I wanted to be frivolous, I might say that everything that precedes editing is merely a way of producing film to edit."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Alexander (1972). ''Stanley Kubrick Directs'', New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich{{page?|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer-director [[Preston Sturges]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]here is a law of natural cutting and that this replicates what an audience in a legitimate theater does for itself.  The more nearly the film cutter approaches this law of natural interest, the more invisible will be his cutting. If the camera moves from one person to another at the exact moment that one in the legitimate theatre would have turned his head, one will not be conscious of a cut. If the camera misses by a quarter of a second, one will get a jolt. There is one other requirement: the two shots must be approximately of the same tone value. If one cuts from black to white, it is jarring. At any given moment, the camera must point at the exact spot the audience wishes to look at. To find that spot is absurdly easy: one has only to remember where one was looking at the time the scene was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}}, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Assistant editors ==
{{More citations needed|section|small=y|date=August 2016}}
Assistant editors aid the editor and director in collecting and organizing all the elements needed to edit the film. When editing is finished, they oversee the various lists and instructions necessary to put the film into its final form. Editors of large budget features will usually have a team of assistants working for them. The first assistant editor is in charge of this team, and may do a small bit of picture editing as well, if necessary. The other assistants will have set tasks, usually helping each other when necessary to complete the many time-sensitive tasks at hand. In addition, an apprentice editor may be on hand to help the assistants. An apprentice is usually someone who is learning the ropes of assisting.

Television shows typically have one assistant per editor. This assistant is responsible for every task required to bring the show to final form. Lower budget features and documentaries will also commonly have only one assistant.

The organizational aspects job could best be compared to database management. When a film is shot, every piece of picture or sound is coded with numbers and [[timecode]]. It is the assistant's job to keep track of these numbers in a database, which, in non-linear editing, is linked to the computer program. The editor and director cut the film using digital copies of the original film and sound, commonly referred to as an "offline" edit. When the cut is finished, it is the assistant's job to bring the film or television show "online". They create lists and instructions that tell the picture and sound finishers how to put the edit back together with the high quality original elements. Assistant editing can be seen as a career path to eventually becoming an editor. Many assistants, however, do not choose to pursue advancement to editor, and are very happy at the assistant level, working long and rewarding careers on many films and television shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5074">The expression '''Geneva School''' refers to (1) a group of linguists based in Geneva who pioneered modern [[structuralism|structural linguistics]] and (2) a group of literary theorists and critics working from a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] perspective.

==Geneva School of Linguistics==
The most prominent figure of the Geneva School of Linguistics school was [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Other important colleagues and students of Saussure who comprise this school include [[Albert Sechehaye]], [[Albert Riedlinger]], [[Serge Karcevski]] and [[Charles Bally]].

The most significant linguistic book connected with this school is ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de linguistique générale]]'', the main work of de Saussure, which was published by his students Charles Bally and Albert Sehechaye. The book was based on lectures with this title that de Saussure gave three times in Geneva from 1906 to 1912. Sehechaye and Bally did not themselves take part in these lecture classes, but they used notes from other students.  The most important of these students was Albert Riedlinger, who provided them with the most material. Furthermore, Bally and Sehechaye continued to develop de Saussure's theories, mainly focusing on the linguistic research of speech. Sehechaye also concentrated on syntactic problems.

===Charles Bally===
In addition to his edition of de Saussure's lectures, Charles Bally also played an important role in linguistics. He lived from 1865 to 1947 and was, like de Saussure, from Switzerland. His parent were Jean Gabriel, a teacher and Henriette, the owner of a cloth store. Bally was married three times: first with Valentine Leirens, followed by Irma Baptistine Doutre, who was sent into a mental institution in 1915 and Alice Bellicot.

From 1883 to 1885 he studied classic language and literature in Geneva. He continued his studies from 1886 to 1889 in Berlin where he was awarded a PhD. After his studies he worked as a private teacher for the royal family of Greece from 1889 to 1893. Bally returned to Geneva and taught at a business school from 1893 on and moved to the Progymnasium, a grammar school, from 1913 to 1939. At the same time, he worked as PD at the university from 1893 to 1913.  Finally from 1913 to 1939 he had a professorship for general linguistic and comparative Indo-German studies which he took over from Ferdinand de Saussure.

Besides his works about subjectivity in the [[French Language]] he also wrote about the crisis in French language and language classes.
Today Charles Bally is regarded as the founding-father of linguistic theories of style and much honored for his theories of [[phraseology]].

Works by Charles Bally:
*''Traité de stylistique française'', 1909
*''Le Langage et la Vie'', 1913
*''Linguistique générale et linguistique française'', 1932

*S. Durrer, ''Introduction à la linguistique de Charles Bally'', 1998

==Geneva School of Literary Criticism==
The expression "Geneva School" ({{lang-fr|groupe de Genève}}) is also applied to a group of literary critics in the 1950s and 1960s, of which the most important were the Belgian critic [[Georges Poulet]], the French critic [[Jean-Pierre Richard]], and the Swiss critics [[Marcel Raymond]], [[Albert Béguin]], [[Jean Rousset]] and [[Jean Starobinski]].  The critics [[Emil Staiger]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], and [[J. Hillis Miller]] are also sometimes associated with this group.

Growing out of [[Russian Formalism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] (such as in the work of [[Edmund Husserl]]), the "Geneva School" used the phenomenological method to attempt to analyse works of literature as representations of deep structures of an author's consciousness and his or her relationship to the real world.  Biographical criticism was however avoided, as these critics focused primarily on the work of art itself &amp;ndash; treated as an organic whole and considered a subjective interpretation of reality (the German concept of ''[[Lebenswelt]]'') &amp;ndash; and sought out the recurrent themes and images, especially those concerning time and space and the interactions between the self and others.&lt;ref&gt;For this section, see Eagleton 1983, pp. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glasmuseet Ebeltoft''' is a museum in [[Ebeltoft]], [[Denmark]]. It is dedicated to the exhibition and collection of contemporary glass art worldwide. 

==Establishment==
The museum was founded in 1985 by Danish glass artists Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch. It is administered by the private Foundation for the Collection of Contemporary International Studio Glass. The museum makes its home in Ebeltofts's former Customs and Excise House; in 2006 a modern wing was added to the original building. In addition to exhibition spaces, the museum has a library, gift shop and cafe that are open to the public. Also in 2006 an enclosed garden and glass-blowing studio were added to the complex. The glass studio presents glass working demonstrations to the public and seminars for students of glass.

==Exhibitions==
The museum presents four to six exhibitions per year that focus on contemporary glass art. It shows experimental work by young artists in group and solo shows, as well as new work by well-established artists. Organized by museum staff, the exhibitions often include catalogs that are printed in several languages for the benefit of an international audience. Glasmuseet Ebeltoft often loans the exhibitions it creates to museums in other countries. In the past these countries have included China, England, Finland, Germany and the United States.

==Collections==
Glasmuseet Ebeltoft’s collection contains 1500 objects by 600 artists.  Its holdings are composed of donations and loans of art works, obtained in most cases directly from the artists whose work is desired by the museum. The museum’s collection is most unusual in that artists who have been invited to be represented in it are permitted to exchange or supplement their works in the collection with new pieces.

Artists represented by work in the collection include Klaus Moje and Nick Mount of Australia; Louis Leloup of Belgium; Václav Ciglar, [[František Janák]], Jiří Harcuba, Pavel Hlava, [[Stanislav Libenský/Jaroslava Brychtová|Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová]] and René Roubíček of the Czech Republic; Eva Engström, Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch of Denmark; [[Ivo Lill]] of Estonia; [[Erwin Eisch]], Ursula Merker, Gerhard Ribka, Kurt Wallstab and Ann Wolff of Germany; Ursula Huber-Peer, Pino Signoretto, [[Bruno Pedrosa]] and [[Lino Tagliapietra]] of Italy; Durk Valkema and [[Sybren Valkema]] of the Netherlands; Anna Carlgren, Gunnar Cyrén, Eva Englund, Göran Wärff and Ulrica Hydman-Vallien of Sweden, [[Charles Bray (glass artist)|Charles Bray]] and [[David Reekie]] of the United Kingdom; and Rick Beck, Gary Beecham, William Bernstein, Katharine Bernstein, [[Nicole Chesney]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Fritz Dreisbach]], [[Shane Fero]], [[Robert C. Fritz|Robert Fritz]], [[Michael Glancy]], Richard Jolley, Jon Kuhn, [[Marvin Lipofsky]], [[Harvey Littleton]], [[John Littleton/Kate Vogel]], [[Dante Marioni]], [[Richard Marquis]], Joel Philip Myers, Mary Shaffer, [[Paul Joseph Stankard|Paul Stankard]], [[Michael Taylor (Glass artist)|Michael Taylor]] and Toots Zynsky of the United States.

==Sponsors==
Because it receives no direct financial support from the Danish government, Glassmuseet Ebeltoft relies on sponsorships from Denmark's business community. The museum's three major sponsors are the textile company [[Kvadrat (company)|Kvadrat]], [[Djursland]] Bank and [[NRG Energy|NRGi]] energy company. Other corporate supporters include Primagaz, Montana Møbler, Blue Water Shipping, Cerama and Mois Linien.

Volunteer help is drawn from the museum's "Friends Society", which has about 900 members.

The '''''Guardians of Time''''' is an art project of the Austrian sculptor [[Manfred Kielnhofer]].

== Idea and history ==
The ''Guardians of Time'' were developed by the artist Manfred Kielnhofer, who is sure that mankind is watched and protected by strange characters. The designer and photographer was always interested in the human being as model as well as a potential source of danger to mankind. In 2006 he created the first life-size "Time Guardians" to be part of the [[Skulpturenpark Artpark]] in [[Linz]]. The sculpture reminds us of a monk. The artist uses the human form as a tool, either on a canvas or in a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;500 x Art in Public, Chris van Uffelen, Braun publishing {{ISBN|978-3-200-02461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years Kielnhofer put his time guardians in public places like in front of ancient castles, squares, old mines or in parks. They traveled to several countries and were part of many exhibitions. In his works of art Manfred Kielnhofer deals with the natural human desire for security. Thus his oeuvre reflects genuine exploration, consideration and discussion of current as well as historic moods and sensibilities of his social environment.
The message is, that people should never forget that they are always watched by a power, that is stronger than mankind.
In 2012 Kielnhofer designed the Mini guards, 54x36x34cm, 1&amp;nbsp;kg, as a limited edition, they are signed and made of plastic. In various colours they can be illuminated from within. One of the Mini guards was ordered by [[Peter Weibel]] for the [[ZKM]] in 2012. Guardians of Time Settle in During Art Dubai 2013.  First cast bronze guardian of the art foundry Krismer. In 2014 the large-scale sculptures 220x220x220cm guardians are shown by the Festival of Lights in Berlin. The guardians are shown by the 56th [[Venice Biennale]] Of Art, Collateral Event – Personal Structures, Time Space Existence at the Palazzo Mora. First works with the glass [[Berengo_Studio]] Murano Venice. A fine empty coat was made of white [[Carrara]] [[marble]] by Studio Massimo Galleni in 2016.

==History==
ICM was formed in 1975 through the merger of Creative Management Associates and [[Ashley-Famous|International Famous Agency]]. In 2005, the company raised a financing round of $75 million from [[Rizvi Traverse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/icm-buyout-jeff-berg-328677|title=ICM Finalizes Management Buyout; Partnership Excludes Former Chairman Jeff Berg|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, ICM acquired the literary agency Broder Webb Chervin Silbermann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/29/business/fi-silbermann29|title=From Boutique Agency to ICM Brass|last=Hoffman|first=Claire|date=2006-07-29|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, the agency completed a management buyout and formed a partnership with the new name, ICM Partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/icm-buyout-jeff-berg-328677&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intermedia''' was a term used in the mid-1960s by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]] to describe various inter-disciplinary art activities that occurred between genres in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1higgins.pdf Dick Hggins, "Intermedia", re-published in Leonardo, vol 34, 2001, p49 - 54, with an Appendix by Hannah Higgins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah B Higgins, "The Computational Word Works of [[Eric Andersen (artist)|Eric Andersen]] and Dick Higgins" in H. Higgins, &amp; D. Kahn (eds), ''Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

The areas such as those between [[drawing]] and [[poetry]], or between [[painting]] and [[theatre]] could be described as "intermedia". With repeated occurrences, these new genres between genres could develop their own names (e.g. [[visual poetry]], [[performance art]]); historically, an example is [[haiga]], which combined brush painting and [[haiku]] into one composition.&lt;ref&gt;''Classic Haiku'' ed. [[Tom Lowenstein]], London: Duncan Baird Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|9781844834860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins described the tendency of what he thought was the most interesting and best in the new art to cross boundaries of recognized media or even to fuse the boundaries of art with media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Higgins/intermedia2.html|author=Higgins, Dick|title=Statement on Intermedia|website=Artpool|publisher=[[Something Else Press]]|location=New York|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had not previously been considered for art forms, including computers. 

{{quote|Part of the reason that [[Duchamp]]'s objects are fascinating while [[Picasso]]'s voice is fading is that the Duchamp pieces are truly between media, between sculpture and something else, while a Picasso is readily classifiable as a painted ornament. Similarly, by invading the land between [[collage]] and [[photography]], the German [[John Heartfield]] produced what are probably the greatest graphics of our century ...|Higgins|Intermedia, 1965, Leonardo, vol. 34, p. 49}}

With characteristic modesty, he often noted that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] had first used the term.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel 'Lecture 111 : On Spenser'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Youngblood]] also described intermedia, beginning in his "Intermedia" column for the [[Los Angeles Free Press]] beginning in 1967 as a part of a global network of multiple media that was "expanding consciousness"—the intermedia network—that would turn all people into artists by proxy. He gathered and expanded ideas from this series of columns in his 1970 book [[Expanded Cinema]], with an introduction by [[Buckminster Fuller]].

==Academia==

In 1968, [[Hans Breder]] founded the first university program in the United States to offer an M.F.A. in intermedia. The Intermedia Area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~interart/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108125036/http://www.uiowa.edu/~interart/ |archivedate=2006-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[The University of Iowa]] graduated artists such as [[Ana Mendieta]] and [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]]. In addition, the program developed a substantial visiting artist tradition, bringing artists such as [[Dick Higgins]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]] and others to work directly with Intermedia students.

Over the years, especially on the Iowa campus, ''intermedia'' has been used interchangeably with ''[[multi-media]]''.  However, recently the latter term has become identified with [[electronic media]] in [[pop-culture]].  While Intermedia values both disciplines, the term "Intermedia" has become the preferred term for [[interdisciplinary]] practice.

Two other prominent University programs that focus on intermedia are the Intermedia program&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.asu.edu/intermedia/]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Arizona State University]] and the Intermedia M.F.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermediamfa.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Maine, founded and directed by Fluxus scholar and author Owen Smith. Additionally, the Roski School of Fine Arts at the [[University of Southern California]] features Intermedia as an area of emphasis in their B.A. and B.F.A. programs. [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec|QC]] offers a B.F.A. in Intermedia/Cyberarts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studio-arts.concordia.ca/undergraduate-programs/intermediacyberarts/]&lt;/ref&gt; Herron School of Art and Design, Indiana University, Purdue University, Indianapolis, has a M.F.A. Program Photography and Intermedia degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herron.iupui.edu/visualart/photography-intermedia Intermedia]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Oregon]] offers a Master of Music degree in Intermedia Music Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~fmo/master/ Master of Music in Intermedia Music Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Edinburgh College of Art [within University of Edinburgh] introduced a BA (Hons) Degree in Intermedia Arts, and intermedia can be a focus of study in Masters programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/school-of-art/undergraduate/intermedia-ba-hons]&lt;/ref&gt;

A baker ([[James Corden]]) and his wife ([[Emily Blunt]]) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the baker's family by a [[Witchcraft|Witch]] ([[Meryl Streep]]) who found the baker's father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the baker's father also stole some magic beans, the witch's own mother cursed her to be ugly. The witch is able to lift the curse and allow them to have a child, but only if the baker and his wife obtain four critical items for her to make a potion: a white cow, a red cape, a yellow strand of hair, and a golden slipper, none of which she is allowed to touch.

The witch's demands eventually bring the baker and his wife into contact with Jack ([[Daniel Huttlestone]]), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood ([[Lilla Crawford]]), whose red cape the couple noticed when she stopped by the bakery earlier to buy bread and sweets on her way to grandmother's house; with blonde-haired Rapunzel ([[MacKenzie Mauzy]]), whose tower the baker's wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella ([[Anna Kendrick]]), who also runs into the baker's wife while fleeing from the pursuing prince ([[Chris Pine]]) and whose ball outfit includes gold slippers.

After a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the baker and his wife are finally able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receives a "[[happy ending]]": Cinderella marries the prince; Rapunzel is freed from her guardian, the witch, by Cinderella's prince's brother and marries him; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the [[Giant]] in the sky, and kills the pursuing giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the [[Big Bad Wolf]] ([[Johnny Depp]]); and the witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.

However, each of the characters learns that their endings don't remain happy: the baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the baker's wife is temporarily seduced by the prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by her cheating prince; and the witch learns that she has lost her magic powers. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the giant's wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters attempt to find Jack, but debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother, Jack's mother, and the baker's wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the witch for growing the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all the remaining beans away, the witch begs her mother to punish her again, hoping to regain her powers, but instead she disappears into a large pit of boiling tar.

The remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening giant's wife though Cinderella and the baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the giant's wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With the giant's wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the prince and help the baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the baker and Cinderella. The baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling the story of the film as the movie ends with the witch's moral, meaning that children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.

==Stage-to-screen changes==

Meanwhile, many of the songs in the film have slightly different lyrics than their stage counterparts due to the slight tweaking of story lines.

Other changes include a major reduction of the significant role of the "mysterious man", who manipulates much of the action in the first act and is eventually revealed to be the baker's father. Also, the character of the narrator is deleted, and the film is instead narrated by the baker.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whyte|first1=Marama|title=Five 'Into the Woods' stage-to-screen changes|url=http://www.hypable.com/2014/12/24/into-the-woods-stage-to-screen-changes/|accessdate=January 2, 2015|work=Hypable.com|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minor role of Cinderella's father was cut, and he is instead mentioned as deceased.  Due to the film's compressed story line, Rapunzel's pregnancy is eliminated, as is the subplot where the two princes have affairs with [[Snow White]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]].&lt;ref name="Whyte" /&gt; In the film, the giant's wife attacks during the marriages of Cinderella and Rapunzel to their respective princes, no more than a few weeks after the events of act one; in the stage show, nearly a year passes between the first and second acts. Rapunzel's ultimate fate is also changed: rather than being killed by the giant, she refuses to cooperate with the witch and flees with her prince.&lt;ref name="Whyte" /&gt;

Similarly, much of the violence and sexual content is slightly toned down from the original musical. For instance, the death of Jack's mother is less violent in the film. On stage, the steward clubs her to death with his staff; in the film, he simply shoves her to the ground and she hits her head on a log. The death of the baker's wife is not explicitly shown in the film, and the cause of her death is changed from being crushed by a tree in the giant's wife's wake to accidentally backing off the edge of a cliff while fleeing from the wife of the giant.

==Production==

===Early development===
Early attempts of adapting ''Into the Woods'' to film occurred in the early 1990s, with a script written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]]. A reading was held with a cast that included [[Robin Williams]] as the Baker, [[Goldie Hawn]] as the Baker's Wife, [[Cher]] as the Witch, [[Danny DeVito]] as the Giant, [[Steve Martin]] as the Wolf, and [[Roseanne Barr]] as Jack's Mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cerasaro|first=Pat|title=BWW EXCLUSIVE: Stephen Sondheim Talks Past, Present &amp; Future|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-EXCLUSIVE-Stephen-Sondheim-Talks-Past-Present-Future-20101103-page2|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Jim Henson Productions]] were also developing a film adaptation with [[Craig Zadan]] as producer and [[Rob Minkoff]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=David|title=Jim Henson's Children Put Together a String of Big Deals to Keep Alive : The Muppet Legacy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-26/business/fi-5359_1_jim-henson/3|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 1992|pages=3 of 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Movie To Mix Live Actors, Jim Henson Characters|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-30/features/9102080788_1_brian-henson-film-project-jim-henson-productions|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Columbia put the film into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], with Minkoff still attached as director, and [[Billy Crystal]], [[Meg Ryan]], and [[Susan Sarandon]] reportedly in talks to star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title='Bliss' sticks in ratings mire; Col chops 'Woods'|url=https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/bliss-sticks-in-ratings-mire-col-chops-woods-1117433140/|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=January 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report by [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], a film adaptation of ''Into the Woods'' remained inactive for 15 years.

===Development at Disney===
After the critical and commercial success of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' in 2002, director [[Rob Marshall]] approached [[Stephen Sondheim]] as he was interested in adapting one of his musicals such as ''[[Follies]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', although Sondheim suggested ''Into the Woods'' instead.&lt;ref name="THRProd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title=Perverted Wolves, Cheating Wives and a Fired 10-Year-Old: The Dark Path to Disney's 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/perverted-wolves-cheating-wives-a-755359|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall concurred, but development of the project was then postponed while he focused on directing ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' and ''[[Nine (2009 live-action film)|Nine]]''. In 2011, Marshall's interest in the project was rekindled when he heard a speech by President [[Barack Obama]] on the tenth anniversary of the [[September 11th attacks]] to the families of the 9/11 victims, which seemed to evoke the same message as the musical's most important song, "No One Is Alone".&lt;ref name="Feinberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feinberg|first1=Scott|title=Rob Marshall on Movie Musicals and His Journey 'Into the Woods' (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/rob-marshall-movie-musicals-his-760996|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall firmly believed that ''Into the Woods'' was “a fairy tale for the post-9/11 generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Tim|title=Disney's 'Into the Woods' Enters Awards Season on High Note|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/disney-enters-awards-race-with-into-the-woods-1201362874/|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Marshall approached [[Walt Disney Pictures]]—for whom he had just directed ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''—and pitched the idea to the studio,&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; with Lapine writing the script and Sondheim "expected" to write new songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Sets Rob Marshall To Direct Adaptation Of 'Into The Woods'|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/disney-sets-rob-marshall-to-direct-adapation-of-into-the-woods/|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Dion Beebe]], who previously collaborated with Marshall on ''Chicago'', ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', and ''Nine'', served as cinematographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|title=Honors and Hires: Oscar Winning DP Dion Beebe Goes 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/honors-hires-oscar-winning-dp-564344|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim confirmed that a new song had been written for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Matt|title=Stephen Sondheim: An audience with a theatre legend|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/stephen-sondheim-an-audience-with-a-theatre-legend-8559902.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Disney's backing, a three-day reading of the entire updated screenplay took place in New York in October 2012 under Marshall's direction, with [[Nina Arianda]] as the Baker's Wife, [[Victoria Clark]] as Cinderella's Mother/Granny/Giant, [[James Corden]] as the Baker, [[Donna Murphy]] as the Witch, [[Christine Baranski]] as Cinderella's Stepmother, [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Florinda, Ivan Hernandez as the Wolf, [[Megan Hilty]] as Lucinda, [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as Rapunzel's Prince, [[Allison Janney]] as Jack's Mother, [[Anna Kendrick]] as Cinderella, [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]] as Steward/Mysterious Man, [[Laura Osnes]] as Rapunzel, [[Taylor Trensch]] as Jack, Casey Whyland as Little Red Riding Hood, and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Cinderella's Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|title=Nina Arianda, Victoria Clark, Patrick Wilson, Cheyenne Jackson, James Corden Part of Into the Woods Film Reading|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/170672-Nina-Arianda-Victoria-Clark-Patrick-Wilson-Cheyenne-Jackson-James-Corden-Part-of-Into-the-Woods-Film-Reading|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Playbill|date=October 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103054115/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/170672-Nina-Arianda-Victoria-Clark-Patrick-Wilson-Cheyenne-Jackson-James-Corden-Part-of-Into-the-Woods-Film-Reading|archive-date=November 3, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this reading which ultimately convinced [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] president [[Sean Bailey]] to [[green-light]] the film despite ongoing concerns about the dark nature of the original musical (which Disney executives had begun to understand since Marshall's original pitch).&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;  However, Disney (which self-finances all its films)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Block|first1=Alex Ben|title=Disney CFO Outlines Strategy, Explains Forgoing Third Party Financing|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-cfo-outlines-strategy-explains-761468|accessdate=January 9, 2015|issue=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided only a relatively small production budget of $50 million (relative to other feature-length fantasy films on its development slate), in turn forcing both cast and crew to accept pay cuts to work on the film.&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Keep and entrance of Dover Castle, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Dover Castle]] in [[Kent]] was used as the exterior for the Prince's castle.]]
In July 2013, before filming began, Marshall put the cast through six weeks&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; of rehearsals on a soundstage and [[Blocking (stage)|blocked]] their scenes.&lt;ref name="Twisted"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|title=Rob Marshall Boldly Explores Disney's Take on Twisted Tale 'Into the Woods'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/features/into-the-woods-rob-marshall-disney-1201346785/|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the cast members visited [[Angel Recording Studios]] to separately record their respective parts in the presence of Sondheim himself.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt; Over 90% of the vocal tracks in the final version of the film are from the recording studio sessions, while the rest were recorded on location or on the set.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt;  The advantage of blocking and rehearsing all scenes first was that the cast members could then precisely calibrate their voices in the recording studio to the planned appearance of each scene when later filmed, thereby minimizing the slightly disconcerting disconnection between vocals and choreography typical of [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="Marchant"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marchant|first1=Beth|title=Editor Wyatt Smith Goes Into the Woods to Cut Sound, Picture and Song|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2015/01/editor-wyatt-smith-goes-woods-cutting-sound-picture-song/|accessdate=January 9, 2015|work=StudioDaily|publisher=Access Intelligence|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

to create realistic gradations and highlights.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; Between scenes, Mauzy had to "wrap [the hair] around her arm like huge rolls of wool", as recalled by King.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; A stuntman was employed to shoot hair-climbing scenes.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; Thin rope and metal rings were the only additional tools concealed within the braid to hold the weight of a person climbing up.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt;

The film's final shot, which essentially merges into and links back to its first shot, actually transitions digitally between three shots: a [[Technocrane]] on location lifting as high as possible into the sky, an [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|aerial drone]] flying down a valley in [[Wales]], and a shot of an overcast sky in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Failes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Failes|first1=Ian|title=Into the Woods: full of effects surprises|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/into-the-woods-full-of-effects-surprises/|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=FXGuide|publisher=FXGuide.com, LLC|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming concluded on November 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cerasaro|first=Pat|title=Filming Wraps On INTO THE WOODS Movie!

===Music===
{{main|Into the Woods (soundtrack)}}
As noted above, the majority of the songs were pre-recorded by the cast.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt; Music producer Mike Higham, who had previously worked with Sondheim on ''Sweeney Todd'': ''The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'', recorded the film's score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="officialpr" /&gt; Music supervisor and conductor [[Paul Gemignani]] instructed the actors on how to sing, including singing live to a camera on set, to prerecorded music in studio, and with a live studio orchestra. [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrated Sondheim's original music.&lt;ref name="officialpr" /&gt; The [[Key (music)|key]] to the song, "Hello, Little Girl," was altered to better suit [[Johnny Depp]]'s lower vocal range. In regards to the song's musical arrangement, Higham explained, "we emphasized the woodwinds to make it feel a little lighter, especially the flutes. And we just made it a little jazzier —&lt;!--mdash with spaces is as quoted--&gt; played more on the walking bass line. Inherently, when it has a jazz feel, it just feels lighter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Ashley|title='Into the Woods': How Disney Tiptoed Around Johnny Depp's Creepy, Sexualized Song|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woods-johnny-depp-sings-hello-760348|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on December 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Records Set To Release Into The Woods Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Into The Woods Deluxe Edition On December 16th|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-set-to-release-into-the-woods-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-and-into-the-woods-deluxe-edition-on-december-16th-282182481.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=December 13, 2014|location=Burbank, California|format=Press release|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was initially reported that the film version would feature two new songs: a duet for the Baker and his Wife, titled "Rainbows"—originally written for a 1992 film adaptation that was never made—and a new song for the Witch, eventually titled "She'll Be Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Zack|title=Disney's Into the Woods Features Major Plot Changes, Stephen Sondheim Reveals—Spoilers Ahead!|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/552578/disney-s-into-the-woods-features-major-plot-changes-stephen-sondheim-reveals-spoilers-ahead|accessdate=June 19, 2014|newspaper=E!

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 71% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus reads: "On the whole, this Disney adaptation of the Sondheim classic sits comfortably at the corner of [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]—even if it darkens to its detriment in the final act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/into_the_woods_2014/|title=Into the Woods|date=December 25, 2014|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], calculate a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/into-the-woods | title=Into the Woods Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3987&amp;p=.htm | title = Weekend Report (cont.): Huge Limited Debuts for 'American Sniper,' 'Selma' | author = Ray Subers | publisher = Box Office Mojo | date = December 28, 2014 | accessdate = December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streep was immensely applauded for her performance as the Witch, with many critics and audiences believing she was the film's heart. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called her and Blunt's portrayals as "two of the greatest female performances of the year".  For her performance, Streep received [[Academy Award]], [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]] nominations for Best Supporting Actress.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film "benefits from respect for the source material, enticing production values and a populous gallery of sharp character portraits from a delightful cast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title='Into the Woods': Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/woods/review/758611|accessdate=December 17, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded the film, writing; "''Into the Woods'', the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for 'children of all ages'".&lt;ref name=NYTReview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=The Quest for Storybook Endings in a Scary but Magical World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/movies/into-the-woods-disneys-take-on-the-sondheim-lapine-classic.html|accessdate=December 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] called the movie as "one of the year's best films". Similarly, Pete Hammond of Deadline praised the film as "the most dazzling movie musical since Marshall's own Chicago." and praised the performance of the cast, particularly Streep. Lou Lumerick of the New York Post called the film "this century's best musical" and lauded the performances of Streep and Blunt as the best female performances of the year. Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' gave a positive review declaring the film "Rob Marshall's best movie ever" and praised it for its genuine entertainment and strong cast performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/12/19/review-disneys-into-the-woods-hits-a-sour-note/ | title = Review: Disney's 'Into The Woods' Hits A Sour Note | author = Scott Mendelson | publisher = ''Forbes'' | date = December 19, 2014 | accessdate = December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] gave a positive review, stating that the film was a "smart, appealing, upside-down children's story for adults of all ages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=REVIEW: Into the Woods: A Disney Musical for Adults of All Ages|url=http://time.com/3647510/review-into-the-woods-a-disney-musical-for-adults-of-all-ages/|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=Time|date=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Ellwood of [[HitFix]] tipped Streep as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] contender in the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] category, and also praised the performance of Chris Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/can-meryl-streep-actually-win-a-fourth-oscar-for-into-the-woods| title = Can Meryl Streep Actually Win A Fourth Oscar For Into The Woods?| author = Gregory Ellwood| date = November 23, 2014| accessdate = December 16, 2014| publisher = Hitfix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Lawson of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'',&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Richard|title=Into the Woods Is a Fairy-Tale Musical Without Much Magic|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/into-the-woods-review|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Conde Nast|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen D'Souza of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'',&lt;ref name="D'Souza"&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Souza|first1=Karen|title=Review: 'Into the Woods' impressive, but a bit too tame|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_27165386/review-into-woods-impressive-but-bit-too-tame?source=rss|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevens|first1=Dana|title=Into the Woods|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2014/12/into_the_woods_starring_meryl_streep_and_emily_blunt_reviewed.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all published critical reviews of the film.  All three found much to like in the acting (especially Blunt and Pine's performances), but all three also concluded that after the various cuts and changes, the final version of the film had failed to adequately preserve the power of the dark [[Existentialism|existentialist]] message at the heart of the original musical's second act.&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Souza" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; Stevens characterized the result as a "generic [[dystopia]]n bummer,"&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; while Lawson criticized the film as a "dutiful but perfunctory adaptation" which lacked "genuine heart".&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt; Paul Katz of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' felt the change in tone between the last two acts was too abrupt, and also criticized the film's faithfulness to the stage musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Paul|title=Into the Woods (Review)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-katz/into-the-woods-review_1_b_6381348.html|accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' disliked the performances by Streep and Depp, while simultaneously calling the film's first two acts a "surprising delight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=How Disney wrecked "Into The Woods"|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/26/how-disney-wrecked-into-the-woods/|accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] around the time of the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|Emancipation]]. His painting and printing work provides an eye-witness document of life in Jamaica of the time. He is one of the earliest artists who took a Jamaica-centric approach to the island's culture. His portfolio includes the lithograph ''Sketches of Character, In Illustration of the Habits, Occupation, and Costume of the Negro Population in the Island of Jamaica'', which was published in collaboration with the lithographer [[Adolphe Duperly]] in 1837–38, documents activities of the former slaves immediately after the emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Barringer]], Gillian Forrester, Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz (eds), ''Art and Emancipation in Jamaica: Belisario and his Worlds'', Yale Center for British Art, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some prints are the earliest visual representation of the masquerade of [[John Canoe]].

The '''Japodian burial urns''' are a series of fifteen burial urns made by the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Japodes]] around the area of [[Bihać]] in [[Bosnia]]. These cremation urns where the cremated remains of the dead were placed in, were beautifully decorated with figurative designs of humans and animals. The Japodian burial urn art was a unique form of art influenced to a degree by the [[Situla (vessel)|Situla]] art of northern Illyria and Italy and by Greek art. The urns represent one of the best Japodian figurative art forms.

The first urn was discovered in 1890 in the necropolis of Jezerina near Bihać. In this fragment the face of a warrior was presented with a helmet, a drinking horn on the right hand and with a spear on the left hand. Almost all of the scenes are linked with the cult of the dead. The urns are broken up in three fazes, grouped up chronologically. The earliest date from the 5th century BC and even probably from the start of the 4th century BC and depict figures related with those of the situla art. The Japodian artists which created the early urns were inspired by the situla art and took many motives from this art, but which transformed the images in order to suit their own tastes. From this the second faze was created but with a much smaller yield. The second faze is linked with Greek art. The third group dates from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era and presents a highly developed form of Japodian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Klänge''''' (German; ''Sounds'') is a book by the Russian expressionist artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Published in an edition of 345 in [[Munich]] in late 1912,&lt;ref name="short"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/tateresearch/tatepapers/06autumn/short.htm A Consideration of the Album ''Sounds'', Christopher Short, Tate Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other sources give early 1913 as an alternative publication date&lt;/ref&gt; the work is a famous early example of an [[artist's book]], containing both poems and woodcuts by the artist, forming two parallel strands, each involving a loose progression.&lt;ref&gt;Modernism-dada-postmodernism By Richard Sheppard, Northwestern University Press. 2000, p411&lt;/ref&gt; One of three seminal books that Kandinsky published between 1911 and 1912 - the other two being ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art'' and ''Der Blaue Reiter Almanac'' that he edited with [[Franz Marc]] - ''Klänge'' was to have a direct and lasting influence on [[Expressionism]], [[Dada]] and [[Russian Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;4 poems from Klange were included in A Slap in the Face of Public Taste, 1912, by David Burliuk and others&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kandinsk.htm |title=Klänge |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226040033/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/kandinsk.htm |archivedate=26 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Kandinsky] began writing prose-poems, composing 38 altogether between 1908 and 1912. In 1913 these were published by Piper Verlag under the title Sounds, accompanied by colour and black-and-white woodcuts. in these Dadaistic poems, Kandinsky employs a method borrowed from young children's early attempts at speech; through constant repetition and babbling words are emptied of their meaning, so that only the pure sound remains. It is Kandinsky's aim to uncover this "pure sound" of language, the sound which "sets the soul vibrating." &lt;ref&gt;''Kandinsky'', Becks-Malorny, Taschen, 1994 p 24&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We fought for painting, but painting alone will not suffice. I had the idea of a synthetic book that removed half of the old, narrow conceptions, breaking down the walls between the arts.... and finally prove that the problem of art is not a problem of form but a problem of spiritual content." Kandinsky,&lt;ref&gt;ci eravamo battuti per la pittura, ma la pittura sola non bastava. Ebbi allora l'idea di un libro sintetico che togliesse di mezzo le vecchie, anguste concezioni, facesse crollare i muri divisori fra le arti.... e dimostrasse infine che il problema dell'arte non è un problema delle forme ma un problema del contenuto spirituale. Quoted in The Book As A Work Of Art, Maffei &amp; Picciau, 2008, p45&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Klänge'', expressionism and Zürich dada==

[[Image:KlangeInner.jpg|thumb|left|360px|An inner spread from ''Klänge'', Wassily Kandinsky, 1912]]
Whilst the relationship between [[expressionism]] and [[dada]] are complex, one critic has compared them to two twins fighting, 'like [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Middleton, quoted in Modernism-dada-postmodernism, p236&lt;/ref&gt; there are numerous links between the two movements. In [[Dada#Berlin|Berlin]], key dadaists such as [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[George Grosz]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]] all started their careers as Expressionists, whilst in [[Dada#Z.C3.BCrich|Switzerland]], two of the founders of Dada, [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Hans Arp]] had formulated a number of key concepts embodied by Zürich Dada, such as an affinity to [[abstract art]] and a belief in theatre 'bursting forth from the roots of all dramatic life' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/4_exhibits/asc/Kandinsky/Reiter_e.htm Der Blaue Reiter, Arnold Schönberg Center]&lt;/ref&gt; - in [[Münich]] as part of the group centred on Kandinsky at the time that ''Klänge'' was published.

Both Arp and Ball had been involved with Kandinsky's group ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' before the [[First World War]];&lt;ref name="Shepperd"/&gt; Arp contributed to the first almanac and exhibited work in the second group exhibition, whilst Ball edited a second almanac with Kandinsky - ''Das Neue Theater'' (''Almanac of New Theatre'') - that was only abandoned due to the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref name="Shepperd"/&gt; A number of poems from ''Klänge'' were read out during performances at the Zürich Dada nightclub the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and two of these were included in the magazine of the same name, published 15 May 1916.&lt;ref name="Shepperd"&gt;Modernism-dada-postmodernism By Richard Sheppard, Northwestern University Press. 2000, p236-239&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Arp was so enamoured of his copy, that later in his life he would allow no-one except himself and his wife ([[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]) to read it.&lt;ref name="Shepperd"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Kandinsky has undertaken the rarest spiritual experiments in his poems. Out of 'pure existence' he has conjured beauties never previously heard in this world. In these poems, sequences of words and sentences surface in a way that has never happened before... Kandinsky (..) confronts the reader with a dying and transforming image, a dying and transforming phrase, a dying and self-transforming dream. In these poems we experience the cycle, the waxing and waning, the transformation of this world. Kandinsky's poems reveal the emptiness of appearances and of reason." Hans Arp on ''Klänge'' &lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, Becks-Malorny, Taschen, 1994 p 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''La danse''''' (also known as '''''Bacchante''''') is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). ''Bacchante'' is a pre-[[Cubism|Cubist]] or [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work executed in a highly personal [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style during the height of the [[Fauvism|Fauve]] period. ''Bacchante'' was painted in Paris at a time when Metzinger and [[Robert Delaunay]] painted portraits of one another, exhibiting together at the [[Salon d'Automne]] and the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. ''Bacchante'' was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (No. 3460), along with ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1|Coucher de soleil]]'' and four other works by Metzinger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll4/id/16983 Jean Metzinger, ''Bacchante'', Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 23ème exposition, 1907, no. 3460, p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was purchased by the art historian and collector [[Wilhelm Uhde]] and formed part of his collection until it was sequestered by the French government just before [[World War I]]. In 1921 the painting reappeared at the auction house [[Hôtel Drouot]] where it was presumably purchased by Kröller-Müller, and published in ''Catalogue of the paintings in the collection of [[Helene Kröller-Müller]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogusvandesc00kr#page/154/mode/2up Catalogus van de schilderijen verzameling van Mevrouw H. Kröller-Müller, Samensteller H.P. Bremmer, Published 1921(?) in 'S-Gravenhage, no. 844 (in Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt; And as late as 1985 ''Bacchante'' was listed in ''Jean Metzinger In Retrospect'' as belonging to the collection of the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]].&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''Bacchante'' was appeared on the website of the Kröller-Müller Museum, dated c.1910.&lt;ref&gt;[https://krollermuller.nl/en/jean-metzinger-bacchante Jean Metzinger, ''Bacchante'', Kröller-Müller Museum] (incorrectly dated circa 1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''La danse (Bacchante)'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 73 x 54&amp;nbsp;cm (28.75 by 21.25 in). The work represents a nude woman in a composition that contains a wide variety of exotic geometrized elements. Metzinger's bold use of color characteristic of his work between 1904 and 1907 is highly noticeable in ''Bacchante''. His brushstrokes are practically all the same size but their directions and colors vary giving rhythm to the overall work. The [[depth of field]] is flattened; the foreground blending in with background components. The subject matter is classical—reminiscent of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] (an artist Metzinger greatly admired)—yet its treatment is everything but classical.

This early work in the Divisionist style represents a Bacchante (or [[maenads]]). In [[Greek mythology]], ''maenads'' were the female followers of [[Dionysus]] (Bacchus in the Roman pantheon), the most significant members of the [[Thiasus]]. Their name literally translates as "raving ones". Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus (also known as Bacchus) into a state of ecstatic frenzy, through a combination of dancing and drunken [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].&lt;ref name="wiles"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wiles | first = David | title = Greek Theatre Performance: An Introduction | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = Cambridge, England | url = http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052164027X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this state they would lose all self-control, begin shouting excitedly, and engage in uncontrolled sexual behavior. Many artists chose this subject over the centuries, probably due to these dramatic characteristics.

Her body is depicted nude, seen from the front, with yellow and white highlights and turquoise reflections, the mythological reference serving as pretext for the nude. She is the primary subject of the work and is framed in an exotic setting that accentuates the arching curve of her back. She has a "deep voluptuousness," as in the works of Ingres (to use the term of Baudelaire), yet her timeless immobility makes her somehow chaste. The scene is seemingly calm and luxurious simultaneously.

Metzinger's early quest for a 'total image' explains the lack of illusory depth, the profuse light, and the refusal to depict a marked difference between the foreground, background and the woman's frame. Metzinger added a conspicuously tropical setting presumably under the influence of [[Paul Gauguin]]'s ''Mahana no atua, Day of the Gods'' (1894) or [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (lLe Douanier) Rousseau]]'s ''Le Rêve'' (two more painters the artist greatly admired). ''Bacchante'' is already typical of Metzinger's style, with its sumptuous textures, sinuous harmony of line (for example the arching trees and foliage), and depiction of the serene attitude and chaste sensuality of the Bacchante's body—all enlisted in Metzinger's quest for absolute perfection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Alex Mittelmann, ''Jean Metzinger: Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm, DSC08255.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1906, ''Portrait de Metzinger'', oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm]]

Catalogue Collection Uhde, tableaux modernes, aquarelles, dessins, Hôtel Drouot, 30 May 1921]]

In 1903 Jean Metzinger arrived in Paris (Montmartre) where he would reside until 1912. At this time he exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and shortly after at the gallery of [[Berthe Weill]], with [[Raoul Dufy]] (1903-1904), with [[Robert Delaunay]] (early 1907), with [[Marie Laurencin]] (1908) and later with [[André Derain]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Kees van Dongen]] (1910). At Weill's gallery he met [[Max Jacob]] (1907), who introduced him to [[Pablo Picasso]] [[Juan Gris]], and Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 Metzinger participated in a group exhibition at [[Wilhelm Uhde]]'s gallery on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs with [[Georges Braque]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jules Pascin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

In the spring of 1906 [[Georges Braque]] exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1907 six paintings by Braque were exhibited. Five were purchased by [[Wilhelm Uhde]]. The sixth work was presumably bought by the art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that Braque first met Kahnweiler and was introduced to [[Picasso]] by Guillaume Apollinaire. Braques works were still Fauve in nature. It wasn't until the autumn of 1907 at L’Estaque that Braque began his transition away from bright hues to more subdued colors, possibly as a result of the memorial exhibition of Cézanne’s work at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/m/explore/collection/art_terms/744/0/1.iphone_ajax?klass=artist Lewis Kachur, ''Georges Braque'', MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear exactly when Uhde purchased ''Bacchante'', but it is probable that Metzinger and Uhde first met circa 1906, around the time Delaunay painted a portrait of Uhde in the same style as Metzinger's ''Bacchante''.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the possessions of many German nationals living in France were sequestered by the French state. Uhde's collection in 1914 included works by [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jean Metzinger]] (of which ''Bacchante''), [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jean Puy]] and [[Henri Rousseau]]. These works were confiscated by the French state and sold seven years later at the auction house [[Hôtel Drouot]] in Paris 30 May  1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll18/id/5190 The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, ''Vente de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de Séquestre de Guerre'': Collection Uhde.

[[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1905-1906 [[Fauvism|Fauvist]]-[[Divisionism|divisionist]] technique had its parallel in literature. For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and [[Neo-Impressionism]]. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's work of this period, his [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]] perspective, beyond the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], and beyond too the preoccupations of his immediate entourage.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature." (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"What Metzinger meant" writes art historian Robert L. Herbert, "is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement." (Herbert, 1968)&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Artists of the years 1910-1914, including Mondrian and Kandinsky as well as the Cubists", writes Robert Herbert, "took support from one of its central principles: that line and color have the ability to communicate certain emotions to the observer, independently of natural form." He continues, "Neo-Impressionist color theory had an important heir in the person of Robert Delaunay. He had been a Neo-Impressionist in the Fauve period, and knew intimately the writings of Signac and Henry. His famous solar discs of 1912 and 1913 are descended from the Neo-Impressionists' concentration upon the decomposition of spectral light."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The height of Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay painted portraits of one another in prominent rectangles of pigment. In the sky of Metzinger's ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1 (Metzinger)|Coucher de soleil no. 1]]'', 1906–1907 (Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller), is the solar disk which Delaunay was later (during his Cubist and Orphist phases) to make into a personal emblem.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's ''Paysage au disque'', "is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..." (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Jean Metzinger, ''Coucher de soleil No. 1''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709190514/http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay—the two often painting together in 1906 and 1907—would develop a new style of Neo-Impressionism incorporating large cubic brushstrokes within highly geometrized compositions that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Both [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Cubo-Divisionist technique between 1909 and 1911. The [[Futurists]] later (1911–1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works, into their 'dynamic' paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

==Cubes==
At the [[Salon des Indépendants]] of 1906 the elected members of the hanging committee included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T. Clement, ''Les Fauves: A sourcebook'', Greenwood Press], {{ISBN|0-313-28333-8}}, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.

Both [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] between 1905 and 1907 painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or rectangular planes of color (see also [[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape (Metzinger)|Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]). Writing about the 1906 Salon des Indépendants, the art critic Louis Chassevent set the two apart from other Fauves and Neo-Impressionists. His use of the term "cube" to describe their work would later be taken up by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: 
:"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been fabricate by machine [...]".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''22e Salon des Indépendants'', 1906, ''Quelques petits salons'', Paris, 1908, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Metzinger and Delaunay, with whom he shared an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery in 1907, were singled out by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

One and a half years later, November 1908, Vauxcelles, in his brief review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery, called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.&lt;ref name="Danchev"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iTzniDD6EwAC&amp;pg=PR123&amp;lpg=PR123&amp;dq=preface,+Exposition+Georges+Braque,+November+1908,+Galerie+Kahnweiler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZ4-_FKVK0&amp;sig=RjxOvhE7jDIbKCa4h8QkIRsoKnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCcxUfLbKa6A0AXIhoGADA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20cubes&amp;f=false Alex Danchev, ''Georges Braques: A Life'', Arcade Publishing, 15 nov. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">{{About|the [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete theory]] of inheritance|the empirically validated genetic phenomenon|Maternal effect}}
The conception of a '''maternal impression''' rests on the belief that a powerful mental (or sometimes physical) influence working on the mother's mind may produce an impression, either general or definite, on the child she is carrying.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock Ellis, ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', vol. 5 p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The child might be said to be "marked" as a result.

==Medicine==
Maternal impression, according to a [[obsolete scientific theory|long-discredited]] [[medicine|medical]] theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of [[birth defect]]s and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an [[emotion]]al [[stimulation|stimulus]] experienced by a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman could influence the development of the [[fetus]]. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] was frightened by an [[elephant]] during her pregnancy, thus "imprinting" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great [[sadness]] might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.

The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern [[genetics|genetic theory]].

==Folklore==
In [[folklore]], maternal imprinting, or '''Versehen'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "inadvertance" or as a verb "to provide") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.

[[Oswald Spengler]] understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called "blood feeling" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is called the ''Versehen'' of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would "prove" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on ''one bodily ideal'', so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald, The Decline of the West, Knopf, NYC, 1928, vol. 2 p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] also comments at length about the phenomenon of ''postpartum'' maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny Natural History VIII:126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.64|''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'']]

'''''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau''''' ({{lang-fr|Napoléon sur le champ de bataille d'Eylau}}) is an [[oil painting]] of 1808 by French [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painter [[Antoine-Jean Gros]]. Completed during the winter of 1807–1808, the work has become an icon of the emerging style of [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|French Romanticism]]. It depicts a moment from the aftermath of the bloody [[Battle of Eylau]] (7–8 February 1807) in which [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] surveys the battlefield where his ''[[Grande Armée]]'' secured a costly victory against the Russians. Although ''Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' retains elements of [[history painting]], it is by far Gros's most realistic work depicting Napoleon and breaks from the subtlety of [[Neoclassicism]]. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of artists like [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]].

== Background ==
{{main|Battle of Eylau}}
In early February 1807, the Russian army, under the command of [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], was in full retreat while being pursued by [[Napoléon Bonaparte]]'s ''[[Grande Armée]]''.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_eylau.html|title=Battle of Eylau|publisher=History of War|author=Rickard, J.|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field armies of Russia's ally, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], had been decisively defeated by the ''Grande Armée'' at the double [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]] on 14 October 1806. This left the Russian army as the only major land force opposing Napoléon in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]].&lt;ref name=series&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_eylau.html#14|title=French Cavalry at Eylau, 1807 and Napoleon's Cavalry Doctrine|publisher=Napoleon Series|author=Beorn, Cadet|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some failed attempts to disrupt the French advance, Bennigsen decided to regroup his retreating forces at the Prussian village of Eylau (now [[Bagrationovsk]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchempire.net/battles/eylau/|title=Battle of Eylau|publisher=French Empire|author=Jensen, Nathan D.|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting began in the afternoon of 7 February when Napoleon's baggage section arrived at Eylau in preparation for the Emperor's arrival, unaware of the Russian presence still in the village. Thinking the French were attempting to capture the village, Bennigsen sent reinforcements to Eylau; Napoléon reciprocated with his own fighting force. Intense engagements followed, especially around the village's church and cemetery, but the French held control of Eylau by the end of the day.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=series/&gt;

The Russians countered in the early morning of 8 February with a massive [[artillery]] bombardment. On the brink of a disastrous defeat, Napoléon called upon the [[Reserve Cavalry Corps (Grande Armée)|Reserve Cavalry Corps]] to [[cavalry charge|charge]] the Russian columns approaching Eylau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/napoleon-vs-russia-battle-of-eylau/|title=Napoleon Vs Russia: Battle of Eylau|publisher=Warfare History Network|author=Hawkins, Jenkins|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It disrupted the Russian offensive long enough for the French lines to stabilize. By nightfall, Bennigsen ordered his forces to withdraw: the French, though able to declare a victory, were left with a snowy battlefield riddled with blood and frozen corpses.&lt;ref name=series/&gt;

== Commission ==
Napoléon sought to ensure that the victory at Eylau, though costly, would not be forgotten, entrusting the director of the [[Louvre]] [[Vivant Denon]] with commissioning an artist as a part of a much larger propaganda campaign.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/paintings/napoleon-visiting-the-battlefield-at-eylau-9-february-1807/|title=NAPOLEON VISITING THE BATTLEFIELD AT EYLAU, 9 FEBRUARY, 1807|publisher=Napoleon Foundation|author=Huguenaud, Karine|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the battle, Denon announced a public competition for the commission: 26 artists sent in their sketches which were exhibited at the Louvre. [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] was declared the winner on 13 June, and completed ''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' during the winter of 1807–1808.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; According to François de Vergnette, Denon stipulated much of what was to be featured in the painting, including "the moment to be depicted, the number of 'extras', the cadavers in the foreground, and the large format".&lt;ref name=louvre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/napoleon-battlefield-eylau|title=Napoleon at the Battle of Eylau|publisher=[[Louvre]]|author=Vergnette, François de|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting portrays Napoleon arriving outside Eylau to survey the battlefield on 9 February 1807, the day after the fighting ended. The painting is on a monumental scale of 521 x 784&amp;nbsp;cm, such that most of the central figures are rendered life-sized.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/g/gros/7eylau.html|title=Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau, 1807|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the figures on the edges of the painting are intentionally cut off to instil a feeling of the work being an actual fragment of a real-life scene. The viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the large pile of corpses in the foreground whose faces are twice life-sized; another soldier, wounded, cries out in a state of [[insanity|madness]].&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt;&lt;ref name=web/&gt; According to the ''64th Grande Armée Bulletin'', the scene was designed "to instil in princes a love of peace and a horror of war".&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;

In the center of the painting Napoléon is seen mounted on a light bay horse surveying the treatment of the wounded, his hand outstretched in a pose reminiscent of [[blessing]] the soldiers. "The consoling expression of the great man", wrote Denon, "seems to soften the horrors of death and spread a softer light on this scene of carnage".&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; He is surrounded by members of his staff: [[Marshal Berthier]], [[Marshal Bessières]], and [[Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt|General Caulaincourt]] are to the left, while [[Marshal Soult]], [[Marshal Davout]] and [[Marshal Murat]] flank on the right.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt; A wounded Lithuanian soldier, taken aback by the compassion of the Emperor, pledges his allegiance to Napoléon while another former combatant embraces his leg.&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==

''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' was first shown at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1809. Initially, some politicians suspected the painting aimed to portray the Emperor unfavorably, but Napoléon himself approved of Gros's work and presented him with the [[Légion d'honneur]] at the painter's award ceremony.&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt; Gros's depiction of Napoléon displayed a degree of realism not present in his earlier painting of the Emperor, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804), nor those by any other artist. In its portrayal of the unpleasant truth of war, ''Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau'' breaks with the prevailing style of [[Neoclassicism]] and was an early landmark in the emerging [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt; Its influence is apparent in the works of French artists like [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], themselves both pioneers of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antoine-Jean-Gros|title=Antoine Jean-Gros|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pala della Peste''' (altarpiece of the bubonic plague) or '''Pallione del Voto''' is a [[Baroque art|Baroque]]-style altarpiece by [[Guido Reni]] depicts the ''Madonna and Child in Glory with the Patron Saints of Bologna: Petronius, Francis, Ignatius, Francis Xavier, Proculus of Bologna, and Florian''. The painting is oil on silk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinacotecabologna.beniculturali.it/collezione/percorsi/percorsoEsp_A.php?IDSala=24&amp;IDOpera=280 Pinacoteca of Bologna], altarpiece called ''Madonna col Bambino in gloria e i Santi Protettori di Bologna Petronio, Francesco, Ignazio, Francesco Saverio, Procolo e Floriano.''(Pala della Peste) and is now in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The altarpiece was painted in 1631-1632 as an ''[[ex voto]]'' after the ebbing of the plague epidemic in 1630 in [[Bologna]]. The altarpiece was in the past paraded yearly in a formal procession from the Palazzo Pubblico to the church of [[San Domenico, Bologna]].

The structure of the painting follows the formal arrangement, exemplified by a late 16th-century canvas by [[Annibale Carraci]] in the Pinacoteca of Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinacotecabologna.beniculturali.it/collezione/percorsi/percorsoEsp_A.php?IDSala=23&amp;IDOpera=63 ''Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Lodovico, Alessio, John the Baptist, Catherine, Francis, and Clare''] (1587-1588), by Annibale Carraci, Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna.&lt;/ref&gt; The Madonna and child are in the superior portion. The infant blesses with his right hand, while the left hand holds a flowering sprig. Around the couple, cherubim are active draping flowers, holding rosaries and scapulars, and crowning the Virgin with a floral crown.

In the scene below, the seven saints implore for Bologna, depicted at the bottom center. [[Charles Borromeo]], recently canonized, at the left was known for his work among the pestilent of Milan. Beside him standing is St [[Proculus of Bologna]], a martyred Roman soldier, holding a sword and palm leaf (symbol of Martyrdom). Across the canvas, the armored St Florian holds a halberd and palm leaf. Kneeling below are: St Petronius with a bishop's mitre at his feet; St Francis in a cassock, and to the right are two Jesuit saints, [[Francis Xavier]] with the palm leaf pointing to him, and the founder of the order St [[Ignatius of Loyola]].

The style recalls the earthy coloring of [[Ludovico Carracci]]. The work is now in the Pinacoteca of Bologna, which also has a 1616 ex voto Madonna by Reni. The ''Palla delle Peste'' is described by Viardot as "an excellent specimen of the pale coloring which Guido had adopted".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8VCAAAAYAAJ ''Wonders of Italian Art''], by Louis Viardot, (1875) page 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815 Austen met the Rev. [[James Stanier Clarke]] in London. He had ideas for her fiction, including a novel to be based on a clergyman with a foothold in urban life, as well as the provincial rural settings she had used so far for clerics in her novels.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time (October 1815) she was staying with her brother in London negotiating the publication of ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', which was then dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] through the good offices of Clarke, who was the Prince's librarian.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; Among Clarke's suggestions was a [[historical novel]] on the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|House of Coburg]]: Austen side-stepped with a disclaimer about her talents.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Lamont, ''Jane Austen and the Old'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 54, No. 217 (Nov., 2003), pp. 661-674, at p. 663. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3661480&lt;/ref&gt;  Clarke recommended that Austen should dedicate ''Emma ''to the Prince Regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myer|first1=Valerie Grosvenor|title=Jane Austen : obstinate heart : a biography|date=1997|publisher=Arcade Publ.|location=New York|isbn=9781559703871|page=215|edition=1. North American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She did this, although she disapproved of his attitude towards his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Austen wrote in a letter to Martha Lloyd on 16 February 1813 of the Prince's infidelities and his wife: "I am resolved at least always to think that she would have been respectable, if the Prince had behaved only tolerably by her at first."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and humour of the ''Plan''==
The intention of the work was to set down the essential parts of the "ideal novel". Austen was following, and guying, the recommendations of Clarke.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; The work was also influenced by some of Austen's personal circle with views on the novel of [[courtship]], and names are recorded in the margins of the manuscript;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Kaplan|title=Jane Austen Among Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrpNvr_H0TUC&amp;pg=PA184|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=1994|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-4970-1|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[William Gifford]], her publisher, and her niece Fanny Knight.&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Keymer|author2=Jon Mee|title=The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1740-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyvdbEUGX6sC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=17 June 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00757-3|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Plan'' became a sort of family joke among the Austens. Some of its aspects parody contemporary works by authors such as [[Sophie Cottin]], [[Fanny Burney]], [[Anna Maria Porter]], and [[Mary Brunton]].&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"/&gt; The satire of the ''Plan'' was analysed by Austen's nephew [[James Edward Austen-Leigh]], in his biography ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' (1869, expanded edition 1871).

'''RAL''' is a [[color|colour]] matching system used in [[Europe]] that is created and administrated by the German RAL gGmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imprint|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/footer-navigation/weitere-seiten/imprint.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RAL non-profit LLC), which is a subsidiary of the German RAL Institute. In colloquial speech RAL refers to the RAL Classic system, mainly used for [[varnish]] and [[powder coating]] but nowadays there are reference panels for plastics as well. 
Approved RAL products are provided with a hologram as of early 2013 to make unauthorised versions difficult to produce. Imitations may show different hue and colour when observed under various light sources.

{{see also|List of RAL colors}}

===RAL Classic===
In 1927 the German ''Reichs-Ausschuß für Lieferbedingungen und Gütesicherung'' (Imperial Commission for Delivery Terms and Quality Assurance) invented a collection of forty colours under the name of "RAL 840".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL Colours history|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/about-ral-colours/ral-colours-history.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that date manufacturers and customers had to exchange samples to describe a tint, whereas from then on they would rely on numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL Historie|url=https://www.ral-logolizenz.com/fileadmin/lib/pdf/RAL_Historie.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s the numbers were changed uniformly to four digits and the collection was renamed to "RAL 840 R" (R for revised). With tints constantly added to the collection, it was revised again in 1961 and changed to "RAL 840-HR", which consists of 210 colours and is in use to this day. In the 1960s the colours were given supplemental names to avoid confusion in case of transposed digits.

As "RAL 840-HR" covered only matte paint the 1980s saw the invention of "RAL 841-GL" for glossy surfaces, limited to 193 colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The RAL CLASSIC Colour Collection|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/en/PRODUCTS-SHOP/RAL-CLASSIC/|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main criterion for colours in the RAL Classic collection is to be of "paramount interest". Therefore, most of the colours in it are used on warning and [[traffic sign]]s or are dedicated to government agencies and public services (for example: RAL 1004 - Swiss [[Postal Service]], RAL 1021 - Austrian Postal Service, RAL 1032 - German Postal Service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the RAL CLASSIC colour collection structured?|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/faqs/faqs-questions-about-ral-classic.html |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first digit relates to the shade of the colour:

===RAL F9===
This collection, which follows the naming of RAL Classic, was invented in 1961. It is nowadays made up of ten colours (RAL 1039-F9 Sand beige, RAL 1040-F9 Clay beige, RAL 6031-F9 Bronze green, RAL 6040-F9-Light olive, RAL 7050-F9 Camouflage grey, RAL 8027-F9 Leather brown, RAL 8031-F9 Sand brown, RAL 9021-F9 Tar black and RAL 6031-HR Bronze green for non-camouflage applications), used by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' for [[military camouflage]] coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL F9|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/en/PRODUCTS-SHOP/RAL-CLASSIC/RAL-F9.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does RAL CLASSIC include the camouflage colours of Germany's Armed Forces?|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/faqs/faqs-questions-about-ral-classic.html|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAL Design===
In 1993 a new colour matching system was introduced, tailored to the needs of [[architect]]s, [[designer]]s and [[advertising|advertisers]]. It started with 1,688 colours and was revised to 1,625 colours. The colours of RAL Classic and RAL Design do not intersect.

Contrary to the preceding systems, RAL Design features no names and its numbering follows a scheme based on the CIELAB colour space, specifically [[Lab color space#Cylindrical representation: CIELCh or CIEHLC|cylindrical CIEHLC]]. Each colour is represented by seven digits, grouped in a triple and two pairs, representing [[hue]] (000–360 degrees, angle in the CIELab colour wheel), [[lightness]] (same as in ''L''*''a''*''b''*) and [[Colourfulness|chroma]] (relative saturation). The three numeric components of almost all RAL Design colours are multiples of 5, most are even divisible by 10.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/all-ral-colours-names/overview-ral-design-colours.html | title=Overview of all RAL Design colours }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Conversion from RAL Design number tuple to CIELAB
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\text{RAL}_\text{Design} &amp;= \left(h_{ab}^{\circ}, L^{*}, C_{ab}^{*}\right)\\
a^{*} &amp;= C_{ab}^{*}\cdot\cos\left(h_{ab}^{\circ}\right)\\
 b^{*} &amp;= C_{ab}^{*}\cdot\sin\left(h_{ab}^{\circ}\right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: "RAL 210 50 15" converts to ''L''* = 50, ''a''* = −12.99, ''b''* = −7.5, for instance.

===RAL Effect===
RAL Effect comprises 420 solid colours and, as a particular highlight, seventy metallic colours. It is the first collection from RAL to be based on waterborne paint systems. No use is made of [[heavy metals]] such as lead, cadmium and chromates.

The newly developed, multifunctional double colour fan RAL E 2 underlines the character of RAL Effect. RAL Effect allows eco-efficient colour production for all paint and lacquer producers.

===RAL Digital===
The [[software]] for architects, interior decorators and all those who deal with colours in a creative way. RAL Digital integrates the colours of RAL Classic, RAL Effect and RAL Design into graphics and CAD programs.

=== RAL Colour Feeling ===
"Colour Feeling 09/10" is primarily designed as a professional planning tool for designers, architects, interior designers, interior decorators and painters. It is meant to be a source of inspiration on how to creatively combine the main trend colours for the coming two years. But also general consumers can be inspired by the work book to develop their own ideas and to create their personal colour design.

'''Real Time Rome''' is the [[MIT Senseable City Lab]]’s contribution to the 2006 [[Venice Biennale]], directed by professor [[Richard Burdett]]. The project aggregated data from cell phones (obtained using [[Telecom Italia]]'s innovative Lochness platform), buses and taxis in Rome to better understand urban dynamics in real time. By revealing the pulse of the city, the project aims to show how technology can help individuals make more informed decisions about their environment. In the long run, this project is intended to reduce the inefficiencies of present-day urban systems and open the way to a more sustainable urban future.

'''Ringbang''' is variously a [[Caribbean]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[music genre]]s, a philosophy, and an [[aesthetic]]&lt;ref name="rollins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |title=Eddy Grant Talks About Ringbang |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811025314/http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; propounded by [[Eddy Grant]] in 1994.

In an interview circa 2000, Grant defined ringbang like this:
{{cquote|Ringbang is the thing that makes the soul quiet. That in a musical concept is [[rhythm]]. A child is given ringbang when a mother rocks it in her arms. Ringbang allowed the slaves to communicate. Ringbang is a bridge that allows us to stop being insular; it is a concept predicated on our being able to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;|1.5em|1.5em}}

In applying ringbang to music, Grant attempted to define a meta-style to encompass all Caribbean rhythms; it was to be a musical [[lingua franca]]. He wished this multicultural style to place no restrictions on [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and he said that he wanted no single country or culture to lay claim to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icerecords.com/ringbang.html |title=Welcome to ringbang! |last=Grant |first=Eddy |authorlink=Eddy Grant |date= |work=Ringbang |publisher=[[Ice Records]] |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among ringbang's stylistic influences are [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]], [[soca music|soca]], [[tuk band|tuk]], and [[zouk]].

Grant says that the word ''ringbang'' comes from vocalists [[scat singing]] "Ringa-ringa-ringbang!". He chose the word one day in 1993, while standing in recording engineer Frank Agarrat's backyard in [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;

==Ringbang music==
In an attempt to popularize ringbang music and its underlying philosophy, Grant asked various recording artists to apply the word (which he [[trademark]]ed)&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|76245553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77388819}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some of their songs. [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artists [[Grynner]], [[Square One (band)|Square One]], Viking Tundah, and others recorded ringbang tracks for Grant's [[record label]]s, [[Ice Records]] and Blue Wave Records. Among the ringbang albums on these labels were ''Fire in de Wave'' (1994), ''Ringbang Rebel Dance'' (1995), ''Ringbang Souljah'' (1996), and ''Ringbang Revolution'' (1997).

On [[New Year's Eve]] 1999, Grant hosted a concert on [[Tobago]] called Ringbang Celebration 2000, at which he performed with the Frontline Orchestra. The event drew approximately 11,000 people, and featured performances from artists from [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref name="rollins2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang.html |title=Kofi Ayivor Goes to Celebrate the New Millenium [sic] |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso legend [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]]'s brief appearance at the event was his final time onstage, as he died the following February.

In March 2003, Ice Records published ''Ringbang 4 Kids'', a selection of songs intended for children of [[primary school]] age. The songs were performed by Barbadian singer Indra Rudder, who had previously sung backing vocals for several Ice Records tracks.

'''Roaring Jack''' was an [[Australia]]n [[Celtic punk]]/[[folk punk]] [[rock band|band]] of the 1980s and 1990s. The band formed in 1985 and played their first shows in [[Sydney]] in 1986. Original members were [[Alistair Hulett]] ([[acoustic guitar]] and [[vocals]]),{{cn|date=November 2018}} Dave Williams (bass), Steve Thompson (drums), Bob (Rab) Mannell (electric guitar and bouzouki) and Hunter Owens (accordion/mandolin and vocals).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Owens was later replaced by Steven (Steph) Miller on the same instruments and on vocals.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Rod Gilchrist replaced Steve Thompson on drums after the recording of their first album.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The band was nominated for two [[ARIA Music Awards]] during their career.&lt;ref name=Alistair&gt;[http://www.folkicons.co.uk/alisbio.htm Alistair's Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615022312/http://www.folkicons.co.uk/alisbio.htm |date=15 June 2006 }} ''Folk Icons''. Accessed 30 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band built a cult following by playing the [[Sydney]] [[public house|pub]] circuit eventually scoring regular slots at the Harold Park Hotel in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] and the [[Sandringham Hotel, Newtown|Sandringham Hotel]] in [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Their music had a strong political focus with emphasis on aboriginal Rights and [[trade union|union]] activism, working class activiism, anti authoritarianism, opposition to gentrification, and other social issues, as well as an emphasis on the pleasure of whiskey and drinking, having fun and cavorting.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In keeping with this the band gave many benefit performances for a diverse range of [[left wing politics|left wing]] causes with fellow rebel rousers [[The Urban Guerillas]], including the workers of [[Cockatoo Island, New South Wales|Cockatoo Island]], [[Sydney Hilton bombing|accused Sydney Hilton bomber Tim Anderson]] and opposition to the first [[Gulf War]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The band went on to support the likes of [[Billy Bragg]], the [[Pogues]] and [[The Men They Couldn't Hang]] during their Australian tours.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Roaring Jack recorded for independent Sydney label Mighty Boy Records. They released the ''Street Celtability'' [[mini-LP]] in 1987, and ''Through The Smoke Of Innocence'' LP (1990).{{cn|date=November 2018}} German label Jump Up Records released all of these as ''The Complete Works'', a double CD package, in 2002.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Some of their best remembered songs include 'Yuppie Town", "The lads from the B.L.F.", "the thin red line", ‘Buy Us A Drink’, ‘The Old Divide And Rule’, ‘Destitution Road’ and ‘We Don’t Play No Elton Fucking John’. A video was made for the single 'Framed', a song which raised awareness of the Campaign Exposing the Frame-Up of Tim Anderson.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The band split in 1992{{cn|date=November 2018}}. Alistair Hulett then enjoyed a successful solo career as an internationally recognised folk musician.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Steph Miller formed his own band, The Wickermen in 1991 and spent most of the 1990s as a multi-instrumentalist in the successful Sydney band, Eva Trout.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Steph released a solo CD, Strange Sea, in 2004.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Roaring Jack reformed briefly for two reunion gigs in 1995.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Alistair Hulett died of liver failure and cancer on 28 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkawhile.co.uk/yabbse/index.php?topic=34027.0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/rovics290110.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint George and the Dragon''''' is a painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c. 1605-07), based upon [[Saint George and the Dragon|the motif with the same name]].

It was painted in [[Genoa]] ([[Saint George]] is the patron of this city) while Rubens was in [[Italy]] to complete his artistic training on behalf of his mentor at the time, Otto van Veen. Many scholars speculate the work was originally commissioned for the Church of [[Sant’Ambrogio]], which was dedicated to Saint George. If so, the commissioner never received the masterpiece, due to the artist holding on to his work until he died in 1640, where [[Felipe IV]] procured the piece. It is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museoprado.mcu.es/idragon.html|title=Saint George and the Dragon|author=|accessdate=2007-09-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012024703/http://museoprado.mcu.es/idragon.html|archivedate=2007-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
 
In the painting the princess represents the church as a whole, and the lamb she is grasping represents the innocence and purity of the church, and Saint George and his steed symbolize the triumph of good over evil as the Saint George stares the beast down from literally “on high”. To reiterate, Saint George’s right foot prominently highlighted above the dragon signifies that the dragon (darkness, devil, evil) is in every way beneath Saint George and the light that envelops him and the princess. In opposition, the dragon’s form, which very much resembles a serpent, rather than the typical lizard, or dinosaur-like depiction of dragons, an allegory to the classic tale of Adam and Eve, where in [[Satan]] takes the form of a serpent.

'''Soul of the South Television Network''' ('''SSN''') is an African-American-focused regional broadcast network owned by SSN Media Group, LP. SSN will primarily broadcast in the Southern USA and secondarily in other high African-American populated cities in the north.&lt;ref name=hwr&gt;Block, Alex Ben. (10/31/2011) [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-network-targeting-african-americans-255111 New Network Targeting African Americans to Launch Next Year]. [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/ Hollywood Reporter].&lt;/ref&gt;

SSN uses the C.A.S.H. system, Central Automated Satellite Headend, and a computer server “cloud based system” originally constructed by the defunct [[Equity Broadcasting]] to send its feed to its affiliated stations. SNN sought affiliations from full power television stations, Class A TV, low power TV stations, digital subchannels and cable outlets.&lt;ref name=hwr/&gt;

==History==
Soul of the South Network was founded in 2011 by [[Edwin Avent]], [[Carl McCaskill]] and [[Larry Morton]].  SSN purchased assets from the bankrupted [[Equity Media Holdings]] including the studio and production facilities of [[KKYK-TV]] and the C.A.S.H. system. SSN was planning to broadcast five hours of news per day with assistance from [[Independent News Network]] with four regional bureaus. SSN was also seeking to purchase TV stations.  Expected original programming was a hip hop music show, family reunion featured program and ''Drum Majors'', concerning music at mostly black colleges, and ''Radioface'', an unscripted comedy and ''Southern Soul Stories'', a documentary series about southern African-American icons and southern events.&lt;ref name=hwr/&gt;

By April 2012, Soul of the South was working to get additional affiliates to reach 50 markets for a two wave launch.&lt;ref&gt;Albiniak, Paige. (April 28, 2012) [https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/for-tv-black-is-the-new-green-1118053226/ For TV, black is the new green]. [https://variety.com/ Variety].&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally planned to launch in the first quarter of 2012&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. (November 24, 2011) [http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8580&amp;Itemid=187 Soul of the South’ TV]. [http://www.sfltimes.com/ South Florida Times]. Beatty Media LLC. &lt;!-- signification source for notabilty --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to fall 2012, SSN instead launched on May 27, 2013 with an announced 30 market launch.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Mike. (April 18, 2013) [http://www.multichannel.com/content/soul-south-sets-launch-date/142798 Soul of the South Sets Launch Date]. Broadcasting &amp; Cable.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to RabbitEars.info, SSN only has 11 broadcast affiliates covering 14% of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=Soul+of+the+South Stations for Network - Soul of the South]. RabbitEars.info. Accessed on October 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The network agreed to carry some games from the first season of the [[Fall Experimental Football League]] in October and November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | date  = October 1, 2014 | title  = FXFL To Be Carried on ESPN3 | url  = http://www.nbcrightnow.com/story/26681849/fxfl-to-be-carried-on-espn3 | location  = New York | publisher  = FXFL | agency  = PR Newswire | accessdate  = October 20, 2014 | via  = NBC Right Now | deadurl  = yes | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141021025920/http://www.nbcrightnow.com/story/26681849/fxfl-to-be-carried-on-espn3 | archivedate  = October 21, 2014 | df  =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the network began dropping affiliates due to financial distress and began winding down operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/104329/soul-of-the-south-mulls-winding-down?page=all|title=Soul of the South Mulls ‘Winding Down'|last1=Beherc|first1=Sean|website=Arkansas Business|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=June 20, 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network's social media channels have been defunct since late June.

'''''The Census at Bethlehem''''' (also known as '''''The Numbering at Bethlehem''''') is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Flemish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1566.  It is signed and measures about 115,5 cm × 164,5 cm.  It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], which acquired it in 1902.  It is one of the first paintings in western art to feature a significant snow landscape and was painted in the aftermath of the winter of 1565, which was one of the harshest winters on record.

==Description==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Census at Bethlehem (detail) - WGA03381.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of Mary and Joseph]]
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Census at Bethlehem (detail) - WGA03385.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of ruined castle]]

The painting shows a Flemish village in winter at sundown.  A group of people is gathered at a building on the left. A sign bearing the Habsburg double-headed eagle is visible on the building.  Other people are making their way to the same building, including the figures of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and the pregnant [[Virgin Mary]] on a donkey. A pig is being slaughtered. People are going about their daily business in the cold, children are shown playing with toys on the ice and having snowball fights.  At the very centre of the painting is a spoked wheel, sometimes interpreted as being a reference to the [[Rota Fortunae|wheel of fortune]].  To the right, a man in a small hut is shown holding a [[Clapper (musical instrument)|clapper]], a warning to keep away from leprosy. Leprosy was endemic in that part of Europe when the painting was created. There is a begging bowl in front of the hut.   As he often did, Bruegel treats a biblical story as a contemporary event. And once again, reference to particular political events has been adduced - in this case, the severity of the [[Netherlands#Habsburg Netherlands 1519.E2.80.931581|Spanish administration]] in the southern [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the Netherlands region was part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and some land in [[France]] and [[Germany]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bruegel may well be making a more general criticism of bureaucratic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti. ''Brueghel''. Milan:Skira, 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events depicted are described in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2, 1-5: {{quotation|And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered... So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.|Luke 2:1-5, [[NKJV]]&lt;ref&gt;From online [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202&amp;version=NKJV ''Luke'' 2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This is a rare subject in previous [[Netherlandish art]]. The ruined castle in the background&lt;sup&gt;see 2nd detail&lt;/sup&gt; is based on the towers and gates of [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen. ''Bruegel''. Pt.2, Random House, 1985. {{ISBN|0-517-44772-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
[[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and his studio made dozens of copies of the painting after his father's death, one of which was sold at auction for $10 million in 2013. Another copy, dated from 1610, is also at  Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' ({{lang-ro|Mormântul Soldatului Necunoscut}}) is a monument located in Bucharest, Romania. Dedicated to the soldiers who died while fighting for [[Romania]]. It is one of many such [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|national tombs]].

It was built in 1923 to commemorate the Romanians who died during [[World War I]].

==History==
In 1923 it was decided to choose one of the fallen soldiers to represent all who had sacrificed their lives during the [[Romania during World War I|war]].

Ten unidentified soldiers who died at [[Battle of Mărăşeşti|Mărăşeşti]], [[Battle of Mărăşti|Mărăşti]], [[Oituz]], [[Târgu Ocna]], [[Târgu Jiu|Jiu]], [[Prahova County|Prahova]], [[Bucharest]], in [[Dobruja]], [[Transylvania]] and [[Bassarabia]] were exhumed and laid in oak coffins, doubled with zinc, inside the "[[Assumption of Mary]]" Church in [[Mărășești]].

On May 13, 1923, the war orphan [[Amilcar Săndulescu]], student at the "[[Dimitrie Sturdza]]" Military High School, knelt in front of the fourth coffin and said: "''This is my father''". After the Unknown Soldier had been chosen, the other nine coffins were buried with military honors in the Heroes' Cemetery in Mărăşeşti.

On May 15, 1923, the Unknown Soldier's coffin, wrapped in a [[Flag of Romania|Romanian Tricolour]], was placed on board of a special train to [[Bucharest]], where it was waited for by the King [[Ferdinand of Romania|Ferdinand]], state officials and an [[honor guard]]. Laid on a cannon carriage pulled by eight horses, the coffin was transported in a long procession to the "[[Michael the Brave|Mihai Vodă]]" Church and remained there for 2 more days, so the people could pay their last respects.

On May 17, 1923 (which was also [[Holidays in Romania|Heroes' Day]]/[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Day]]), the coffin was buried inside a crypt in [[Carol Park]] with full military honors in the presence of the Royal family, the Government, members of Parliament, and numerous members of the public. The stone slab of the crypt read: "''Here lies at rest happily unto the Lord the Unknown Soldier, who sacrificed his life for the unity of the Romanian people. On his bones lies the land of united Romania. 1916–1919.''"

On the night of December 22/23, 1958, the Unknown Soldier’s monument was dismantled and moved, in great secrecy, to the [[Mărășești]] Mausoleum by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] to make room for the [[Carol Park#Mausoleum|Mausoleum of the Communist Heroes]], where several leaders of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Party]] were later interred (among them [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]).

In 1991, after the fall of the regime, the Tomb was moved back into the Carol Park, closer to its original location.

In 2007 the Tomb was moved even closer to its original 1923 location, right next to the Communist mausoleum.

The '''Twenty-five Year Award''' is an [[List of architecture prizes|architecture prize]] awarded by the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) to buildings and structures that have "stood the test of time for 25 to 35 years",&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;[http://www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAB089482 Twenty-Five Year Award]. [[American Institute of Architects]]. Retrieved November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "[exemplify] design of enduring significance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzszAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pjgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3602,2908222&amp;dq=twenty-five-year-award+architecture&amp;hl=en Haystack school to receive architecture award]. ''[[Bangor Daily News]]''. December 10, 1993. p. 24. Retrieved July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Twenty-five Year Award was first presented in 1969, and has been handed out every year from 1971 onward. In 2017, the prize was awarded to the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], for the project titled Grand Louvre – Phase I by [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]].

The project receiving the award can be located anywhere in the world, but must be designed by an architect licensed in the United States. Only four buildings outside of the United States have received the award, one each in [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia|Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], [[London]], [[England]], and [[Paris]], [[France]]. [[New York City]] has the most awards at five, while [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[New Haven]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] are all tied in second with two awards each.

Buildings to which [[Finnish American]] architect [[Eero Saarinen]] has contributed have received six awards, tied with the architectural firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]. [[Louis I. Kahn]] has been honored five times. Buildings by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] have received this award four times, and both [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] as well as the firm [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]] have each had three of their buildings honored. Of the 48 projects that have received this award, only two, [[Eames House]] and the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], had women as contributing architects.

==Eligibility==
The Twenty-five Year Award can be awarded to any type of architectural project and may be either a single structure or a group of structures that compose a larger whole.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt; Past examples of projects winning the award in this way include both monuments, such as the [[Gateway Arch]] and [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and groupings of buildings, such as the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] and [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]]. Most buildings nominated for this award are new structures but one winner, [[Faneuil Hall#Faneuil Hall Marketplace|Faneuil Hall Marketplace]], was a substantial renovation of warehouses into a [[festival marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Robert. [http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2008/12/21/two_urban_drawing_cards_are_now_in_limbo/ Two urban drawing cards are now in limbo]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. December 21, 2008. Retrieved July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a project to be eligible to win the Twenty-five Year Award, it must have been built between 25 and 35 years before the year of the award. It must also have been designed by "an architect licensed in the United States at the time of the project’s completion". This means that the award candidate can be anywhere in the world, but must have been designed by a licensed American architect, such as the [[Fundació Joan Miró]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt;

To be nominated the project must be in a "substantially completed form" as well as "in good condition". Potential candidates must not have been altered substantially since they were built. Change of use is allowed by the rules, but the "original intent" of the structure must still be intact.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt; These changes of use include reorganization of interior space. This was taken into account with the [[Price Tower]], which when built was a mix of offices and apartments, but when awarded, had only one apartment remaining.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hWcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9CkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1949,5804096&amp;dq=twenty-five-year-award+aia&amp;hl=en AIA honors Wright tower].

==Nomination procedure==

"Any AIA member, group of members, component, or Knowledge Community" is allowed to nominate a project for the Twenty-five Year Award. A project may be nominated multiple times, as long as it still complies with the eligibility requirements. Nominees are judged by today's architectural standards in their function, execution, and creativity. The project and its site are judged together, with any changes in context taken into account.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt;

==Award recipients==
The "Year awarded" column states the year the award was handed out, and has a link to an article about the significant architectural events of that year.

[[Image:Burne-Jones-le-Vampire.jpg|thumb|''The Vampire'', by [[Philip Burne-Jones]], 1897]]
A '''vampire''' is a being from [[folklore]] that subsists by feeding on the [[Vitalism|vital force]] (generally in the form of [[blood]]) of the living. In [[European folklore]], vampires were [[undead]] beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore [[shroud]]s and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.

Vampiric entities have been [[Vampire folklore by region|recorded in most cultures]]; the term ''vampire'' was popularised in Western Europe after reports of an 18th century [[mass hysteria]] of a pre-existing folk belief in the [[Balkans]] and [[Eastern Europe]] that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism.&lt;ref name="SU223"&gt;Silver, A., &amp; Ursini, J. (1997). ''The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Interview with the Vampire'' (pp. 22–23). New York: Limelight Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Local variants in Eastern Europe were also known by different names, such as ''[[shtriga]]'' in [[Albanian mythology|Albania]], ''[[vrykolakas]]'' in [[Greece]] and ''[[strigoi]]'' in [[Folklore of Romania|Romania]].

In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the ''[[chupacabra]]'' still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of [[decomposition]] after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death.

The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "[[The Vampyre]]" by [[John William Polidori|John Polidori]]; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="SU373"&gt;Silver, A., &amp; Ursini, J. (1997). ''The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Interview with the Vampire'' (pp. 37–38). New York: Limelight Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' is remembered as the quintessential [[vampire literature|vampire novel]] and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s 1872 novel ''[[Carmilla]]''. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire [[genre]], still popular in the 21st century, with books, [[vampire films|films]], television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the [[horror fiction|horror]] genre.

== Etymology ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the first appearance of the English word ''vampire'' (as ''vampyre'') in English from 1734, in a travelogue titled ''Travels of Three English Gentlemen'' published in ''[[The Harleian Miscellany]]'' in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vampire |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |editor=J.

The Serbian form has parallels in virtually all [[Slavic languages]]: [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] вампир (''vampir''), [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''vampir'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''vampir'', [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''upír'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''wąpierz'', and (perhaps [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]]-influenced) ''upiór'', [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] упир (''upyr''), [[Russian language|Russian]] упырь (''upyr{{'}}''), [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] упыр (''upyr''), from [[Old East Slavic]] упирь (''upir{{'}}'') (many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as "vampir/wampir" subsequently from the West; these are distinct from the original local words for the creature).

== Folk beliefs ==
{{see also|List of vampires in folklore and mythology}}
The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[Hebrews]], [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had tales of [[demon]]s and [[spirit]]s which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century [[southeast Europe|southeastern Europe]],&lt;ref name="SU223"/&gt; when [[oral culture|verbal traditions]] of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are [[revenant (folklore)|revenants]] of evil beings, [[suicide]] victims, or [[Witchcraft|witches]], but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit [[demonic possession|possessing]] a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even [[public execution]]s of people believed to be vampires.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

=== Description and common attributes ===

It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its [[shroud]] or coffin and its left eye was often open.&lt;ref name="Barb412"&gt;Barber, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general [[fang]]s were not a feature.&lt;ref name="Barb2"&gt;Barber, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.&lt;ref name="Dundes, Alan 1998 pg 13, 14"&gt;Dundes, Alan (ed) (1998) ''The Vampire: A Casebook'' University of Wisconsin Press {{ISBN|0-299-15924-8}} pg 13, 14, 22, 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levkievskaja&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite journal|last=Levkievskaja|first=E.E.|year=1997|title=La mythologie slave : problèmes de répartition dialectale (une étude de cas : le vampire)|journal=Cahiers Slaves|volume=1|url=http://www.recherches-slaves.paris4.sorbonne.fr/Cahier1/Levkievskaja.htm|accessdate=2007-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112192340/http://www.recherches-slaves.paris4.sorbonne.fr/Cahier1/Levkievskaja.htm|archivedate=12 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Creating vampires ====
[[File:Ernst6-thumb.gif|thumb|upright|Illustration of a vampire from [[Max Ernst]]'s ''[[Une Semaine de Bonté]]'' (1934)]]

The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Chinese folklore|Chinese]] traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead.&lt;ref name="Barb30"&gt;Barber, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In [[Folklore of Russia|Russian folklore]], vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] while they were alive.&lt;ref name="Strange &amp; Amazing"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reader's Digest Association|title=The Reader's Digest Book of strange stories, amazing facts: stories that are bizarre, unusual, odd, astonishing, incredible&amp;nbsp;... but true|year=1988|publisher=Reader's Digest|location=London|isbn=978-0-949819-89-5|pages=432–433|chapter=Vampires Galore!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as [[scythe]]s or [[sickle]]s,&lt;ref name="Barb5051"&gt;Barber, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the [[ancient Greek]] practice of placing an [[Charon's obol|obolus in the corpse's mouth]] to pay the toll to cross the [[River Styx]] in the underworld. It has been argued that instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the ''[[vrykolakas]],'' in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription "[[Jesus Christ]] conquers" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=John Cuthbert|title=Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion|pages=405–06|year=1910|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|oclc=1465746|isbn=978-0-524-02024-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the [[patellar ligament|tendons at the knees]] or placing [[poppy]] seeds, [[millet]], or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains,&lt;ref name="Barb49"&gt;Barber, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating an association of vampires with [[arithmomania]]. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of [[rice]], it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in [[Folklore of India|myths from the Indian subcontinent]], as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.&lt;ref name=Jaramillo&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaramillo Londoño|first=Agustín|title=Testamento del paisa|year=1986|origyear=1967|edition=7th|publisher=Susaeta Ediciones|location=Medellín|isbn=978-958-95125-0-0|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Albanian folklore, the [[dhampir]] is the hybrid child of the ''karkanxholl'' (a [[werewolf]]-like creature with an iron [[mail (armour)|mail]] shirt) or the ''lugat'' (a water-dwelling [[ghost]] or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression ''the dhampir knows the lugat''. The ''lugat'' cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. ''Dhampiraj'' is also an Albanian surname.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5biAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=dhampiri Gjurmime albanologjike, ''Folklor dhe etnologji''], Vol. 15, pp. 58–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Identifying vampires ====
Many rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.&lt;ref name="Strange &amp; Amazing"/&gt; Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white.&lt;ref name="Barb6869"&gt;Barber, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.&lt;ref name="Barb125"&gt;Barber, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition.&lt;ref name="Barb109"&gt;Barber, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face.&lt;ref name="Barb1145"&gt;Barber, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor [[poltergeist]]-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects,&lt;ref name="Barb96"&gt;Barber, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mara (folklore)|pressing]] on people in their sleep.&lt;ref name="Bun1689"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

[[Apotrope|Apotropaics]]—items able to ward off revenants—are common in vampire folklore. [[Garlic]] is a common example,&lt;ref name="Barber6"&gt;Barber, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of [[rosa acicularis|wild rose]] and [[common hawthorn|hawthorn]] plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling [[mustard seed]]s on the roof of a house was said to keep them away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mappin|first=Jenni|title=Didjaknow: Truly Amazing &amp; Crazy Facts About&amp;nbsp;... Everything|year=2003|publisher=Pancake|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-330-40171-5|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a [[crucifix]], [[rosary]], or [[holy water]]. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on [[consecration|consecrated ground]], such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.&lt;ref name="Burkhardt221"&gt;Burkhardt, "Vampirglaube und Vampirsage", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic, [[mirror]]s have been used to ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a [[soul]]).&lt;ref name=EoOc&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Lewis|title=An Encyclopaedia of Occultism|year=1960|publisher=University Books|location=New Hyde Parks|oclc=3417655|isbn=978-0-486-42613-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attribute is not universal (the Greek ''vrykolakas/tympanios'' was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in ''Dracula'' and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="SU25"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please.&lt;ref name=EoOc/&gt; Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to [[sunlight]].&lt;ref name="SU25"/&gt;

Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with [[impalement|staking]] the most commonly cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures.&lt;ref name="Barber73"&gt;Barber, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ash tree|Ash]] was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alseikaite-Gimbutiene|first=Marija|authorlink=Marija Gimbutas|title=Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit|year=1946|location=Tübingen|oclc=1059867|language=de}} (thesis).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[common hawthorn|hawthorn]] in Serbia,&lt;ref name="Vuk59"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vukanović|first=T.P.|year=1959|title=The Vampire|journal=Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society|volume=38|pages=111–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a record of [[oak]] in [[Silesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klapper|first=Joseph|title=Die schlesischen Geschichten von den schädingenden Toten|journal=Mitteilungen der Schlesischen Gesellschaft für Volkskunde|volume=11|pages=58–93|year=1909|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of "deflating" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of "[[anti-vampire burial]]":  burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.&lt;ref name="Barb158"&gt;Barber, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Decapitation]] was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the [[buttocks]] or away from the body.&lt;ref name="Barber73"/&gt; This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.&lt;ref name="Barb157"&gt;Barber, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discovery News''. June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Romani people]] drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near [[Venice]], a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Ariel David, "Italy dig unearths female 'vampire' in Venice", 13 March 2009, [[Associated Press]] via [[Yahoo!

Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling [[holy water]] on the body, or by [[exorcism]]. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the [[coffin]] was taken. For resistant cases, the body was [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In [[Old Saxony|Saxon regions]] of Germany, a [[lemon]] was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient beliefs ===
[[File:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|''[[Lilith]]'' (1892), by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]]]]
Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNally|first=Raymond T.|author2=Florescu, Radu.|title=In Search of Dracula|year=1994|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=978-0-395-65783-6|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''vampire'' did not exist in ancient times.

Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of [[vetala|vetālas]], ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the ''[[Baital Pachisi|Baitāl Pacīsī]]''; a prominent story in the ''[[Kathāsaritsāgara]]'' tells of King [[Vikramāditya]] and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard R.|authorlink=Richard Francis Burton|title=Vikram and The Vampire:Classic Hindu Tales of Adventure, Magic, and Romance|origyear=1870|year=1893|publisher=Tylston and Edwards|location=London|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/goth/vav/vav00.htm|accessdate=2007-09-28|isbn=978-0-89281-475-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pishacha|Piśāca]]'', the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.&lt;ref name="Bun200"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many myths surrounding vampires originated during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers [[Walter Map]] and [[William of Newburgh]] recorded accounts of revenants,&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William of Newburgh|author2=Paul Halsall|authorlink=William of Newburgh|title=Book 5, Chapter 22–24|website=Historia rerum Anglicarum|publisher=Fordham University|year=2000|accessdate=2007-10-16|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/williamofnewburgh-five.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant.&lt;ref name="Jones121"&gt;Jones, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scandinavian folklore|Old Norse]] ''[[draugr]]'' is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ármann | last=Jakobsson |year=2009 | title=The Fearless Vampire Killers: A Note about the Icelandic ''Draugr'' and Demonic Contamination in ''Grettis Saga'' | journal=Folklore | issue=120 | page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event to the lack of a ''[[shemira|shmirah]]'' (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soul, Evil Spirits, and the Undead: Vampires, Death, and Burial in Jewish Folklore and Law|last=Epstein|first=Saul|last2=Robinson|first2=Sara Libby|journal=Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural|year=2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=232–51|doi=10.5325/preternature.1.2.0232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vampires proper originate in folklore widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularized. One of the earliest recordings of vampire activity came from the region of [[Istria]] in modern [[Croatia]], in 1672.&lt;ref name="Istria"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klinger|first=Leslie|title=The New Annotated Dracula|year=2008|chapter=Dracula's Family Tree|page=570|publisher=W.W.

Local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart, but when the method failed to kill him, he was subsequently beheaded with better results.&lt;ref name="Giure"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caron|first=Richard|title=Ésotérisme, gnoses &amp; imaginaire symbolique: mélanges offerts à Antoine Faivre|year=2001|chapter=Dracula's Family Tree|page=598|publisher=Peteers, Bondgenotenlaan 153|location=Belgium|isbn=978-90-429-0955-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires.&lt;ref name="Barb5to9"/&gt; Despite being called the [[Age of Enlightenment]], during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in [[East Prussia]] in 1721 and in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of [[Petar Blagojevich]] and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.&lt;ref name="Barb5to9"&gt;Barber, pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second case, Miloš, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while [[hay]]ing. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Miloš had returned to prey on the neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283318599|title=Vampire Evolution|last=Jøn|first=A.

The two incidents were well-documented. Government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Barb1521"&gt;Barber, pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The hysteria, commonly referred to as the "18th-Century Vampire Controversy", raged for a generation. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-claimed vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them.&lt;ref name="Hoyt84"/&gt;

====Dissertations on vampirology====

In 1597, [[King James VI and I|King James]] wrote a dissertation on witchcraft titled ''[[Daemonologie]]'' in which he wrote the belief that demons could possess both the living and the dead. Within his [[classification of demons]], he explained the concept through the notion that [[incubus|incubi]] and [[succubus|succubae]] could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Daemonologie. A Critical Edition. In Modern English. 2016|page=80|isbn=978-1-5329-6891-4|date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1645 the Greek librarian of the Vatican, [[Leo Allatius]], produced the first methodological description of the Balkan beliefs in vampires (Greek: vrykolakas) in his work ''De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus'' ("On certain modern opinions among the Greeks").&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.

From 1679, Philippe Rohr devotes an essay to the dead who chew their shrouds in their graves, a subject resumed by Otto in 1732, and then by [[Michael Ranft]] in 1734. The subject was based on the observation that when digging up graves, it was discovered that some corpses had at some point either devoured the interior fabric of their coffin or their own limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marigny|first1=Jean|title=Sang pour Sang, Le Réveil des Vampires, Gallimard, coll|date=1993|isbn=978-2-07-053203-2|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranft described in his treatise of a tradition in some parts of Germany, that to prevent the dead from masticating they placed a mound of dirt under their chin in the coffin, placed a piece of money and a stone in the mouth, or tied a handkerchief tightly around the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

Some theological disputes arose. The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic Church. A paragraph on vampires was included in the second edition (1749) of ''De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione'', On the [[beatification]] of the servants of God and on [[canonization]] of the blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini ([[Pope Benedict XIV]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lambertini, P.|year=1749|title=De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione|volume=Pars prima|chapter= XXXI|pages=323–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, while the [[incorruptibility|incorruption]] of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of "imagination, terror and fear". In other words, vampires did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=de Ceglia F.P.|title=The Archbishop's Vampires.

[[File:Title_page_to_Don_Calmet's_Treatise.png|thumb|right|upright|Cover page of ''[[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]]'' (1751)]]
[[File:Dom Augustin Calmet.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving of [[Antoine Augustine Calmet|Dom Augustine Calmet]] from 1750]]
[[Antoine Augustine Calmet|Dom Augustine Calmet]], a French theologian and scholar, published a comprehensive treatise in 1751 titled ''[[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.|Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]]'' which investigated the existence of vampires, demons, and spectres. Calmet conducted extensive research and amassed judicial reports of vampiric incidents and extensively researched theological and mythological accounts as well, using the scientific method in his analysis to come up with methods for determining the validity for cases of this nature. As he stated in his treatise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. Translated by Rev Henry Christmas &amp; Brett Warren. 2015|date=1751|isbn=978-1-5331-4568-0|pages=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hey see, it is said, men who have been dead for several months, come back to earth, talk, walk, infest villages, ill use both men and beasts, suck the blood of their near relations, make them ill, and finally cause their death; so that people can only save themselves from their dangerous visits and their hauntings by exhuming them, impaling them, cutting off their heads, tearing out the heart, or burning them. These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, [[leech]]es; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Calmet had numerous readers, including both a critical [[Voltaire]] and numerous supportive [[demonologist]]s who interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.&lt;ref name="Hoyt84"/&gt; In the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique|Philosophical Dictionary]],'' Voltaire wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Dictionary|author=Voltaire|year=1984|origyear=1764|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044257-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|These vampires were corpses, who went out of their graves at night to suck the blood of the living, either at their throats or stomachs, after which they returned to their cemeteries. The persons so sucked waned, grew pale, and fell into [[tuberculosis|consumption]]; while the sucking corpses grew fat, got rosy, and enjoyed an excellent appetite. It was in Poland, Hungary, [[Silesia]], [[Moravia]], Austria, and [[Alsace-Lorraine|Lorraine]], that the dead made this good cheer.}}

The controversy in Austria only ceased when Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] sent her personal physician, [[Gerard van Swieten]], to investigate the claims of vampiric entities. He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding the end of the vampire epidemics. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local folklore.&lt;ref name="Hoyt84"&gt;Hoyt, pp. 101–06&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-European beliefs ===
Beings having many of the attributes of European vampires appear in the folklore of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.&lt;ref name=attwater&gt;{{cite journal|author=Atwater, Cheryl|year=2000|title=Living in Death: The Evolution of Modern Vampirism|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|volume=11|issue=1–2|pages=70–77|doi=10.1525/ac.2000.11.1-2.70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Africa ====
Various regions of Africa have folktales featuring beings with vampiric abilities: in [[West Africa]] the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling ''[[asanbosam]]'',&lt;ref name="Buns11"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ewe people]] of the ''[[adze (folklore)|adze]],'' which can take the form of a [[firefly]] and hunts children.&lt;ref name="Buns2"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] region has the ''[[impundulu]],'' which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the [[Betsileo]] people of [[Madagascar]] tell of the ''ramanga'', an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles.&lt;ref name="Bunson, p. 219"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Americas ====
The ''[[Loogaroo]]'' is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or [[West African Vodun|voodoo]]. The term ''Loogaroo'' possibly comes from the French ''[[loup-garou]]'' (meaning "werewolf") and is common in the [[culture of Mauritius]]. The stories of the ''Loogaroo'' are widespread through the [[Caribbean Islands]] and [[Louisiana]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Buns1623"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar female monsters are the ''[[Soucouyant]]'' of [[Trinidad]], and the ''[[Tunda]]'' and ''[[Patasola]]'' of [[Colombian folklore]], while the [[Mapuche]] of southern [[Chile]] have the bloodsucking snake known as the ''[[Peuchen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martinez Vilches, Oscar|title=Chiloe Misterioso: Turismo, Mitologia Chilota, leyendas|year=1992|page=179|publisher=Ediciones de la Voz de Chiloe|location=Chile|oclc=33852127|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aloe vera]]'' hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American folklore.&lt;ref name=Jaramillo/&gt; [[Aztec mythology]] described tales of the [[Cihuateteo]], skeletal-faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.&lt;ref name="Strange &amp; Amazing"/&gt;

During the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was [[New England vampire panic|widespread in parts of New England]], particularly in [[Rhode Island]] and eastern [[Connecticut]]. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term "vampire" was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease [[tuberculosis]], or "consumption" as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves.&lt;ref name=sledzik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sledzik|first=Paul S.|author2=Nicholas Bellantoni|year=1994|title=Bioarcheological and biocultural evidence for the New England vampire folk belief|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=94|issue=2|pages=269–274|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330940210  |pmid=8085617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old [[Mercy Brown vampire incident|Mercy Brown]], who died in [[Exeter, Rhode Island]] in 1892.

Vampires have appeared in [[Japanese cinema]] since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin.&lt;ref name=Buns378&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nukekubi]] is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things|last=Hearn|first=Lafcadio|authorlink=Lafcadio Hearn|year=1903|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-585-15043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends of female vampire-like beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the [[Philippine mythology|Philippines]], [[Malay folklore|Malaysia]] and [[Folklore of Indonesia|Indonesia]]. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] ''[[Mandurugo]]'' ("blood-sucker") and the [[Visayan]] ''[[Manananggal]]'' ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the [[aswang]] that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.&lt;ref name="ramos"/&gt; The ''manananggal'' is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck [[fetus]]es from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the [[heart]] and the [[liver]]) and the phlegm of sick people.&lt;ref name="ramos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramos|first=Maximo D.|title=Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology|origyear=1971|year=1990|publisher=Phoenix Publishing|location=Quezon|isbn=978-971-06-0691-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malaysian ''[[Penanggalan]]'' is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of [[black magic]] or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysians hung ''jeruju'' (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the ''Penanggalan'' would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leyak]] is a similar being from [[Balinese mythology|Balinese folklore]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Witchcraft, Grief, and the Ambivalence of Emotions|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=26|issue=3|year=1999|pages=711–737|doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.3.711|first=Michele|last=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|Kuntilanak]]'' or ''Matianak'' in Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|Pontianak]]'' or ''[[Langsuyar|Langsuir]]'' in Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; is a woman who [[Maternal mortality in fiction|died during childbirth]] and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off.

[[Jiangshi]], sometimes called "Chinese vampires" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence ([[qi|qì]]) from their victims.

=== Modern beliefs ===
In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic [[villain]].&lt;ref name="Barb2"/&gt; Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; Allegations of vampire attacks swept through [[Malawi]] during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor [[Eric Chiwaya]], based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Raphael|last=Tenthani|title='Vampires' strike Malawi villages|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2602461.stm|date=23 December 2002|accessdate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1970 local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted [[Highgate Cemetery]] in London. Amateur [[vampire hunter]]s flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the "[[Highgate Vampire]]" and who later claimed to have [[exorcism|exorcised]] and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Highgate Vampire: The Infernal World of the Undead Unearthed at London's Highgate Cemetery and Environs|last=Manchester|first=Sean|year=1991|location=London|publisher=Gothic Press|isbn=978-1-872486-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in [[Birmingham]], England, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets. Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|title=Reality Bites|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1392607,00.html|date=18 January 2005|accessdate=2007-12-29|location=London|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VampireE3.jpg|thumb|upright|A vampire costume]]
In 2006, a physics professor at the [[University of Central Florida]] wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on [[geometric progression]]. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within two and a half years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-science.net/othernews/061024_vampire.htm Math vs. vampires: vampires lose], world-science.net, 25 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the more notable cases of vampiric entities in the modern age, the ''[[chupacabra]]'' ("goat-sucker") of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Mexico]] is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of [[domesticated animal]]s, leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The "chupacabra hysteria" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Wagner|url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm|title=On the trail of the Chupacabras|accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Taylor T|date=28 October 2007|title=The real vampire slayers|work=The Independent|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3096920.ece|accessdate=2007-12-14|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September / October 2017, mob violence in Malawi related to a vampire scare killed about 6 people accused of being vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/j5jxnx/mobs-in-malawi-have-killed-six-people-for-being-vampires|title=Mobs in Malawi have killed six people for being "vampires"|last=|first=|date=19 October 2017|work=VICE News|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar spate of vigilante violence linked to vampire rumours occurred there in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/10/09/world/africa/09reuters-malawi-un-vampires.html|title=Vampire Scare Prompts U.N.

Vampirism and the [[vampire lifestyle]] also represent a relevant part of modern day's [[occult]]ist movements.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The mythos of the vampire, his [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magickal]] qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism that can be used in ritual, energy work, and magick, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, L., &amp; Kathleen Mcphillips, K. (Eds.). (2006). Popular spiritualities: The politics of contemporary enchantment. Burlington, Ashgate Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American sub-culture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the [[Goth subculture|neo gothic]] aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Young, T. H.|year=1999|title=Dancing on Bela Lugosi's grave: The politics and aesthetics of Gothic club dancing|jstor=1290878|journal=Dance Research|volume=17|issue=1|pages=75–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collective noun ====
"[[Coven]]" has been used as a collective noun for vampires, possibly based on the [[Wicca]]n usage. An alternative collective noun is a "house" of vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices|first=Michelle|last=Belanger|page=118|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|location=Woodbury MN|isbn=978-0-7387-1220-8|oclc=245535068|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of vampire beliefs ==
Commentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs and related [[mass hysteria]]. Everything ranging from [[premature burial]] to the early ignorance of the body's [[decomposition]] cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.&lt;ref name="Barb1to4"&gt;Barber, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathology ===
==== Decomposition ====
Paul Barber in his book ''Vampires, Burial and Death'' has described that belief in vampires resulted from people of [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition.&lt;ref name="Barb1to4"&gt;Barber, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/staking_claims_the_vampires_of_folklore_and_fiction/|title=Staking Claims: The Vampires of Folklore and Fiction|last=Barber|first=Paul|date=March–April 1996|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=29 June 2015|volume=20|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look "plump", "well-fed", and "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the [[Arnold Paole|Arnold Paole case]], an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life.&lt;ref name="Barb117"&gt;Barber, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.&lt;ref name="Barb1145"/&gt;

Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition.&lt;ref name="Barb105"&gt;Barber, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of [[flatulence]] when they passed through the anus. The official reporting on the [[Petar Blagojevich]] case speaks of "other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect".&lt;ref name="Barb119"&gt;Barber, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Blagojevich case—the [[dermis]] and [[nail (anatomy)#Parts of the nail|nail beds]] emerging underneath were interpreted as "new skin" and "new nails".&lt;ref name="Barb119"/&gt;

==== Premature burial ====
It has also been hypothesized that vampire legends were influenced by individuals being [[buried alive]] because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and it would appear that they had been "feeding".&lt;ref name="Marigny2"&gt;Marigny, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies.&lt;ref name="Barber128"&gt;Barber, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely cause of disordered tombs is [[grave robbery]].&lt;ref name="Barber13738"&gt;Barber, pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Contagion ====
Folkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community.&lt;ref name=sledzik/&gt; The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of [[Mercy Brown vampire incident|Mercy Brown]] and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of [[bubonic plague]], it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Porphyria ====
In 1985 biochemist [[David Dolphin]] proposed a link between the rare blood disorder [[porphyria]] and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous [[heme|haem]], he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Dolphin D (1985) "Werewolves and Vampires," annual meeting of American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;!--Can't the details to a paper reference be dug up properly? Or at least to a good secondary reference mentioning the link? Adams might be our only possibility...--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did vampires suffer from the disease porphyria—or not?|website=The Straight Dope|publisher=Chicago Reader|date=7 May 1999|accessdate=2007-12-25|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990507.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pierach|first=Claus A.|title=Vampire Label Unfair To Porphyria Sufferers|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 June 1985|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E4D71239F930A25755C0A963948260|accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered popular modern folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kujtan|first=Peter W.|title=Porphyria: The Vampire Disease|publisher=The Mississauga News online|date=29 October 2005 |url =http://www.bydewey.com/drkporphyria.html|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rabies ====
[[Rabies]] has been linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a neurologist at Xeral Hospital in [[Vigo]], Spain, examined this possibility in a report in ''[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]]''. The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and [[hypersexuality]]. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). [[Wolf|Wolves]] and [[bat]]s, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gómez-Alonso|first=Juan|year=1998|title=Rabies: a possible explanation for the vampire legend|journal=Neurology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=856–59|pmid=9748039|doi=10.1212/WNL.51.3.856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 September 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/178623.stm|title=Rabies-The Vampire's Kiss|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychodynamic theories ===
In his 1931 treatise ''On the Nightmare'', [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Ernest Jones]] asserted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and [[defence mechanism]]s. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may [[psychological projection|project]] the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to [[psychological repression|repression]], which [[Sigmund Freud]] had linked with the development of morbid dread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Ernest|year=1911|title=The Pathology of Morbid Anxiety|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=81–106|doi=10.1037/h0074306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect may or may not be present.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of dying]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KXOUiGfJ8_oC&amp;pg=PT205&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html McMahon, ''Twilight of an Idol'', p. 193].&lt;/ref&gt;

The innate sexuality of bloodsucking can be seen in its intrinsic connection with [[cannibalism]] and folkloric one with [[incubus (demon)|incubus]]-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with [[semen]] being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular [[Sadistic personality disorder#Freud and psychoanalysis|sadism]]; he felt that [[Psychosexual development#Oral stage|oral sadism]] is integral in vampiric behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "The Vampire", pp. 116–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political interpretations ===
[[File:The Irish Vampire - Punch (24 October 1885), 199 - BL.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Editorial cartoon|Political cartoon]] in ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' magazine from 1885, depicting the [[Irish National League]] as the "Irish Vampire" preying on a sleeping woman]]

The reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=David|year=1996|title=Vampires, Mummies, and Liberals: Bram Stoker and the Politics of Popular Fiction|publisher=Duke University Press|place=Durham, NC.|isbn=978-0-8223-1798-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic ''[[ancien regime]]''. In his entry for "Vampires" in the ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' (1764), Voltaire notices how the mid-18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now "there were stock-jobbers, brokers, and men of business, who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight; but they were not dead, though corrupted. These true suckers lived not in cemeteries, but in very agreeable palaces".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1660&amp;chapter=202474&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 VAMPIRES. – Voltaire, The Works of Voltaire, Vol. VII (Philosophical Dictionary Part 5) (1764)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx defined capital as "dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks".&lt;ref&gt;An extensive discussion of the diffenrent uses of the vampire metaphor in Marx's writings can be found in {{cite web |last=Policante |first=A. |url=http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/Policante.pdf |title=Vampires of Capital: Gothic Reflections between horror and hope |year=2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128025458/http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/Policante.pdf |archive-date=28 January 2012 }} in [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html Cultural Logic], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Herzog]], in his ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'', gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist [[Jonathon Harker]], a middle-class solicitor, becomes the next vampire; in this way the capitalist [[bourgeois]] becomes the next parasitic class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brass|first=Tom|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=25|pages=205–237|year=2000|title=Nymphs, Shepherds, and Vampires: The Agrarian Myth on Film|doi=10.1023/A:1011615201664|issue=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathology ===
A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. [[Serial killer]]s [[Peter Kürten]] and [[Richard Trenton Chase]] were both called "vampires" in the [[tabloid journalism|tabloids]] after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. Similarly, in 1932, an unsolved murder case in [[Stockholm]], Sweden was nicknamed the "[[Atlas Vampire|Vampire murder]]", because of the circumstances of the victim's death.&lt;ref name=Stig1&gt;{{cite book|last=Linnell|first=Stig|title=Stockholms spökhus och andra ruskiga ställen|origyear=1968|year=1993|publisher=Raben Prisma|isbn=978-91-518-2738-4|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer [[Elizabeth Báthory]] became particularly infamous in later centuries' works, which depicted her bathing in her victims' blood in order to retain beauty or youth.&lt;ref name="Hoyt6871"&gt;Hoyt, pp. 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern vampire subcultures ===
''Vampire lifestyle'' is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the [[Goth subculture]], who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, [[horror film]]s, the fiction of [[Anne Rice]], and the styles of Victorian England.&lt;ref&gt;Skal(1993) pp. 342–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as ''sanguine vampirism'', and ''[[psychic vampire|psychic vampirism]]'', or supposed feeding from [[prana|pranic]] energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jøn|first=A.

=== Vampire bats ===
{{main|Vampire bat}}
[[File:Desmodus.jpg|thumb|A [[vampire bat]] in Peru]]
Although many cultures have stories about them, [[vampire bat]]s have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore. Vampire bats were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no vampire bats in Europe, but [[bat]]s and [[owl]]s have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits,&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper92"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=J.C.|title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals|pages=25–26|year=1992|publisher=Aquarian Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85538-118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in modern English [[heraldry|heraldic]] tradition, a bat means "Awareness of the powers of darkness and chaos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heraldic "Meanings"|publisher=American College of Heraldry|accessdate=2006-04-30|url=http://www.americancollegeofheraldry.org/achsymbols.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three species of vampire bats are all [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to Latin America, and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any [[Old World]] relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;

The literary [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of ''Dracula'' followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|film]], where [[Béla Lugosi]] would transform into a bat.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt; The bat transformation scene was used again by [[Lon Chaney, Jr.|Lon Chaney Jr.]] in 1943's ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skal (1996) pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern fiction ==
&lt;!--**This section is a general overview, do not add cultural references here, add them to the subarticles... Thanks.*****--&gt;
The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was [[John Polidori]]'s ''The Vampyre'' (1819), featuring the vampire [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280805194|title=From Nosteratu to Von Carstein: shifts in the portrayal of vampires|last=Jøn|first=A.

The vampire theme continued in [[penny dreadful]] serial publications such as ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: ''[[Dracula]]'' by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.&lt;ref name="Christopher"&gt;Christopher Frayling (1992) ''Vampyres&amp;nbsp;– Lord Byron to Count Dracula''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth,&lt;ref name="Skal99"&gt;Skal(1996) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|Murnau's]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) fearing daylight.&lt;ref name="Skal104"&gt;Skal(1996) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright [[Hamilton Deane]] to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.&lt;ref name="Skal62"&gt;Skal(1996) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.&lt;ref name="SU389"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, [[immortality]] is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{main|Vampire literature}}
[[File:Varney the Vampire or the Feast of Blood.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover from one of the original serialized editions of ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'', an influential publication in the development of the modern vampire genre&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt;]]
The vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as ''The Vampire'' (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, ''[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]'' (1773) by [[Gottfried August Bürger]], ''Die Braut von Corinth'' (''The Bride of Corinth'') (1797) by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Robert Southey]]'s ''Thalaba the Destroyer'' (1801), [[John Stagg (poet)|John Stagg]]'s "The Vampyre" (1810), [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s [[Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson|"The Spectral Horseman"]] (1810) ("Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore") and "Ballad" in ''[[St. Irvyne]]'' (1811) about a reanimated corpse, Sister Rosa, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s unfinished ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' and [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[The Giaour]]''.&lt;ref name="Marigny poems"&gt;Marigny, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires: ''The Vampyre'' (1819). This was in reality authored by Byron's personal physician, [[John Polidori]], who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient, "Fragment of a Novel" (1819), also known as "The Burial: A Fragment".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, pp. 271–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt; Byron's own dominating personality, mediated by his lover [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] in her unflattering ''roman-a-clef'' ''Glenarvon'' (a Gothic fantasia based on Byron's wild life), was used as a model for Polidori's undead protagonist [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]]. ''The Vampyre'' was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="SU378"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carmilla.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Carmilla]]'' by [[D. H. Friston]], 1872]]
''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' was a landmark popular mid-[[Victorian era]] [[gothic horror]] story by [[James Malcolm Rymer]] and [[Thomas Peckett Prest]], which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as ''[[penny dreadful]]s'' because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney.&lt;ref name="SU389"/&gt; Another important addition to the genre was [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s [[lesbian vampire]] story ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampire Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.&lt;ref name="SU401"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''Dracula'' (1897).&lt;ref name="SU43"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Europe where [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Drawing on past works such as ''The Vampyre'' and ''Carmilla'', Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as ''The Land Beyond the Forest'' (1888) by [[Emily Gerard]] and other books about Transylvania and vampires. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad Ţepeş]], the "real-life Dracula", and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as ''Dracula's Guest''.&lt;ref name="Marigny Drac"&gt;Marigny, pp. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer [[Marilyn Ross]]'s ''[[Barnabas Collins]]'' series (1966–71), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic [[tragic hero]]es rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular and influential ''[[Vampire Chronicles]]'' (1976–2003).&lt;ref name="SU205"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century brought more examples of vampire fiction, such as [[J.&amp;nbsp;R. Ward]]'s [[Black Dagger Brotherhood]] series, and other highly popular vampire books which appeal to teenagers and young adults. Such vampiric [[paranormal romance]] novels and allied vampiric [[chick-lit]] and vampiric [[occult detective]] stories are a remarkably popular and ever-expanding contemporary publishing phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-06-28-vampire-romance_x.htm Vampire Romance].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Esdaile Banks|L.&amp;nbsp;A. Banks]]' ''[[The Vampire Huntress Legend Series]]'', [[Laurell K. Hamilton]]'s erotic ''[[Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter]]'' series, and [[Kim Harrison]]'s ''[[Hollows (series)|The Hollows]]'' series, portray the vampire in a variety of new perspectives, some of them unrelated to the original legends. Vampires in the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]] (2005–2008) by [[Stephenie Meyer]] ignore the effects of garlic and crosses and are not harmed by sunlight, although it does reveal their supernatural status.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2205143/|title=I Vant To Upend Your Expectations: Why film vampires always break all the vampire rules|last=Beam|first=Christopher|date=20 November 2008|website=Slate Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richelle Mead]] further deviates from traditional vampires in her [[Vampire Academy (series)|''Vampire Academy'' series]] (2007–present), basing the novels on Romanian lore with two races of vampires, one good and one evil, as well as half-vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/kir/lifestyle/79852562.html|title=Vampire buzz takes bite in Kirkland|publisher=Pnwlocalnews.com|date=21 December 2009|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{main|Vampire films}}
[[File:NosferatuShadow.jpg|thumb|A scene from [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', 1922]]
Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. [[Dracula in popular culture|Dracula is a major character]] in more films than any other but [[Sherlock Holmes]], and many early films were either based on the novel ''Dracula'' or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'', directed by [[F. W. Murnau]] and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic ''Dracula''{{'}}s, Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. Universal's ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first [[sound film|talking film]] to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' in 1936.&lt;ref name="Marigny film1"&gt;Marigny, pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bela lugosi dracula.jpg|thumb|left|[[Count Dracula]] as portrayed by [[Béla Lugosi]] in 1931's ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'']]
The legend of the vampire continued through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent [[Hammer Horror]] series of films, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as the Count. The successful 1958 ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role.&lt;ref name="Marigny film2"&gt;Marigny, pp. 92–95.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as ''[[Count Yorga, Vampire]]'' (1970), an African Count in 1972's ''[[Blacula]]'', the BBC's ''[[Count Dracula (1977)|Count Dracula]]'' featuring French actor [[Louis Jourdan]] as Dracula and [[Frank Finlay]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing]], and a Nosferatu-like vampire in 1979's ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'', and a remake of ''Nosferatu'' itself, titled [[Nosferatu the Vampyre]] with [[Klaus Kinski]] the same year. Several films featured the characterisation of a female, often lesbian, vampire such as Hammer Horror's ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970), based on ''Carmilla'', though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character.&lt;ref name="Marigny film2"/&gt;

[[File:Jonathan Frid Barnabas Collins Dark Shadows 1968.JPG|thumb|right|upright|1960s television's ''Dark Shadows'', with [[Jonathan Frid]]'s [[Barnabas Collins]] vampire character]]
The [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', on American television from 1966 to 1971 and produced by [[Dan Curtis]], featured the vampire character [[Barnabas Collins]], portrayed by Canadian actor [[Jonathan Frid]], which proved partly responsible for making the series one of the most popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later Dan Curtis 1972 television series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' revolved around reporter Carl Kolchak hunting a vampire on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Later films showed more diversity in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Blade (film series)|''Blade'']] films and the film ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; ''Buffy'', released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with adaptation to a long-running hit [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|series of the same name]] and its spin-off ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. Still others showed the vampire as protagonist, such as 1983's ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', 1994's ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its indirect sequel of sorts ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'', and the 2007 series ''[[Moonlight (TV series)|Moonlight]]''. The 1992 film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.&lt;ref name="SU208"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' and ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', and the Russian ''[[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]]'' and a TV miniseries remake of ''[[Salem's Lot (2004 TV miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]'', both from 2004. The series ''[[Blood Ties (TV series)|Blood Ties]]'' premiered on [[Lifetime Television]] in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, illegitimate son of [[Henry VIII of England]] turned vampire, in modern-day [[Toronto]], with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled ''[[True Blood]]'', gives a [[Southern Gothic]] take to the vampire theme.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;

In 2008 the [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] series ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]'' became popular in Britain. It featured an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;Germania, Monica (2012): Being Human?  Twenty-First-Century Monsters.

The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]] and the perennial dread of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Wayne|author2=Flavia Idriceanu|title=Legends of Blood: The Vampire in History and Myth|year=2005|publisher=NPI Media Group|location=London|isbn=978-0-7509-3736-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
The [[role-playing game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as ''embrace'' and ''sire'', appear in contemporary fiction.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Popular [[List of vampire video games|video games about vampires]] include ''[[Castlevania]]'', which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel ''Dracula'', and ''[[Legacy of Kain]]''.&lt;ref name=joshi&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=stJxdpZVl_wC&amp;pg=PA646|title=Icons of horror and the supernatural|volume=2|author=Joshi, S.

The '''Vincent Scully Prize''' was established in 1999 to recognize exemplary practice, scholarship or criticism in architecture, historic preservation and urban design. Created by the [[National Building Museum]] in Washington, D.C., the award first honored the distinguished Yale professor and namesake of the award, author and educator, [[Vincent Scully]].&lt;br&gt;
The Museum’s website states that the Prize is awarded annually, however no award was made in 2003, 2004, 2015 or 2016. These omissions are not explained on the website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbm.org/about/awards/ “National Building Museum – Awards”] Retrieved 8 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 2014 Prize was presented to former talk show host [[Charlie Rose]]. The Museum website no longer lists Rose as a winner of the Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbm.org/about/awards/ “National Building Museum – Awards”] Retrieved 8 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The National Building Museum awards two other annual prizes: the [[Honor Award]] for individuals and organizations who have made important contributions to the U.S.'s building heritage, and the [[Henry C. Turner Prize]] for Innovation in Construction Technology.
