==Accidents and incidents==
*On 28 April 1981, [[douglas C-47|Douglas C-47A]] PK-OBK crashed on approach to [[Simpang Tiga Airport]], [[Pekanbaru]], whilst on a non-scheduled passenger flight. Nine of the 17 people on board were killed.&lt;ref name=ASN280481&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19810428-0 |title=PK-OBK Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 August 1984, Douglas C-47A PK-OBC crashed into a mountain near [[Wamena]]. Two of the three people on board were killed.&lt;ref name=ASN150884&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19840815-0 |title=PK-OBC Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 16 March 2012, a [[Eurocopter]] AS350B3 registered PK-ODA carrying 3 people slammed into a cliff while flying over Papua. Everyone on board, including the [[New Zealand]] pilot, were killed instantly in the crash. The crash was categorized as CFIT.&lt;ref&gt;http://kemhubri.dephub.go.id/knkt/ntsc_aviation/baru/Final%20Report%20PK-ODA.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In early 2017, one of their [[MD-82]] or [[MD-83]] experienced a super stall, while trying to climb higher than the performance would allow with that weight. The airplane lost several thousand feet before recovery was made. The pilots tried to hide the fact, but the next crew realized something was wrong when several warming lamps went off. The incident caused huge embarrassment for Airfast Indonesia and Freeport, which is one of the major customers of this airline.

'''Ann Gloag''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born '''Ann Heron Souter'''; 10 December 1942, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]) is a Scottish business woman and charity campaigner. She is co-founder of the international transport company [[Stagecoach Group]].

==Biography==
Educated at Caledonian Road Primary School and [[Perth High School]], she qualified as a nurse , and during a 20-year career worked as a burn unit sister. She is ranked as Scotland's richest woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/scotgaz/people/famousfirst527.html|title=Overview of Ann Heron Gloag|publisher=Scottish-places.info|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stagecoach===
Using her father's redundancy money, and working with her brother [[Brian Souter|Sir Brian Souter]] and her first husband [[Robin Gloag]], Gloag established the Stagecoach Group in 1980, running buses from Dundee to London. Expansion continued and in the early 1990s, Stagecoach acquired National Bus Company operations in Cumberland, Hampshire, East Midlands, Ribble, Southdown and the United Counties. Stagecoach bought further bus operations in Scotland, Newcastle and London, with Manchester being added in 1993.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Manston Airport===
In November 2013, Gloag took ownership of [[Kent International Airport]], also known as [[Manston Airport]] for the sum of [[Pound sterling|£1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-24532999|title=Manston Airport sold to Stagecoach founder for £1|website=Bbc.co.uk|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloag's co-director is [[Pauline Bradley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pauline Bradley|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=29536681&amp;privcapId=13705047|title=Pauline Bradley: Executive Profile|website=Investing.businessweek.com|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a corporate lawyer and former head of joint ventures at [[Bank of Scotland]], described by the Scottish Herald as "''one of Scotland's most powerful women''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/head-of-joint-ventures-at-bos-quits-to-join-kenmore-1.65525|title=Head of joint ventures at BoS quits to join Kenmore|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=19 January 2005|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite assurances to staff regarding long term investment in the airport,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/ann-gloag-believes-1-manston-airport-will-take-off-1.142397%20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521012433/http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/ann-gloag-believes-1-manston-airport-will-take-off-1.142397%20|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; management announced a consultation on closure in April 2014.

Uncertainty about the airport's future led flight operators who were using Manston to leave, notably [[KLM]] who ran a twice daily service to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam Schiphol]]. A number of bids were forthcoming during the consultation period to buy and run the airport,&lt;ref name="kentonline1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Chris|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/dramatic-last-minute-offer-for-17318|title=Manston airport: Dramatic last-minute offer to buy Thanet site by US group RiverOak rejected as staff leave for last time|publisher=Kentonline.co.uk|date=15 May 2014|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 15 May 2014 Manston was closed with the loss of 144 jobs in the airport and an unknown number in the surrounding area. Gloag did not appear publicly or give a reason for the airport's closure or her refusal to sell. The [[trade union]] Unite said it would challenge the way the consultation on closure was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10813475/Manston-Airport-closure-bizarre-says-union.html|title=Manston Airport closure 'bizarre', says union|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Gale|Sir Roger Gale]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|Thanet North]], described Gloag's actions as an act of "corporate vandalism".&lt;ref name="kentonline1"/&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, Gale and pressure groups including ''Save Manston Airport'' and ''Why Not Manston?'' continue to campaign for the reopening of the airport and have opposed alternative uses. In May 2014, then [[Prime Minister of the UK|prime minister]] [[David Cameron]], in answer to a question from Gale in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Houses of Commons]], stated that the future of Manston was the responsibility of the airport owner, but the Government was in negotiation with Mrs Gloag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140514/debtext/140514-0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 14 May 2014 (pt 0001)|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 planning inspectors rejected an appeal stating that the site was protected for aviation use under EC4 regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/business/war-of-words-continues-as-planning-chiefs-refuse-change-of-use-of-buildings-at-manston-airport-1-5106233|title=War of words continues as planning chiefs refuse change of use of buildings at Manston airport|first=Tom|last=Pyman|website=Kentnews.co.uk|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gloag has owned [[Beaufort Castle, Scotland|Beaufort Castle]] near [[Inverness]] since 1995, and [[Kinfauns Castle]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] since 2004. She has attempted to block off private access at Kinfauns in a high-profile case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=819912006|title=The Scotsman|publisher=Thescotsman.scotsman.com|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/5040326.stm|work=BBC News|title=Tycoon launches court access bid|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 2007 she was successful in gaining a court ruling that she was legally entitled to bar the public from a swath of woodland in the grounds of Kinfauns Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Severin|last=Carrell|title=Multimillionaire uses financial muscle to bar ramblers from woods|url=https://www.theguardian.com/country/article/0,,2102624,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=14 June 2007|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Banking Lobby''' refers to the representatives from various firms and organizations seeking favorable terms from governments for big [[bank]]s and other [[financial service]] companies through [[lobbying]] and [[advocacy group]]s.

The banking lobby generally opposes stricter [[government regulation]] of [[financial markets]] while tending to stress the importance of banks in the economy. Some are concerned, however, that they may seek terms that do not necessarily increase performance of the economy as a whole, but only benefit the large banks.

In the US the [[finance industry|finance]], [[real estate]], and [[insurance industry|insurance industries]] reportedly spent a collective [[Orders_of_magnitude_(currency)#1_billion_to_100_billion|$6.8 Billion]] from 1998 through 2011, far more than any other lobbying sector.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;{{cite web

In the US the [[Financial Services Roundtable]] is the most noted organization involved in bank lobbying with members from the 100 largest banks and financial firms.

The '''Britannia Trophy''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] award presented by the [[Royal Aero Club]] for aviators accomplishing the most meritorious performance in aviation during the previous year.&lt;ref name="raec" /&gt;

In 1911 [[Horatio Barber]], who was a founder member of the Royal Aero Club, was given £100 for a commercial flight. Not wanting to tarnish his amateur status, he presented the money to the club for the trophy.&lt;ref name="Times52501" /&gt;

The first award was presented in 1913 to Captain C.A.H Longcroft of the Royal Flying Corps for a non-stop flight from Montrose to Farnborough in a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]]a.&lt;ref name="Times52501" /&gt; The trophy has not been awarded every year, particularly during the first and second world wars, and has been awarded jointly and to teams, as well as individuals.

In 1952 the Royal Aero Club presented plaques to all the surviving holders who previously only held the trophy for one year and were not given a permanent memento.&lt;ref name="Times52501" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35921">[[File:Chimneysweep.png|thumb|John Colfer A chimney sweeper in 1850 Wexford Ireland.]]
A '''chimney sweep''' is a person who clears [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[soot]] from [[chimney]]s. The chimney uses the [[Stack effect|pressure difference]] caused by a hot column of gas to create a draught and draw air over the hot coals or wood enabling continued combustion. Chimneys may be straight or contain many changes of direction. During normal operation, a layer of [[creosote]] builds up on the inside of the chimney, restricting the flow. The creosote can also catch fire, setting the [[chimney fire|chimney and the building alight]]. The chimney must be swept to remove the soot. This was done by the master sweep.

In Great Britain, the master sweeps took apprentices, typically [[workhouse]] or orphan boys, and trained them to climb chimneys. In the [[States of the German Confederation|German States]], master sweeps belonged to [[trade guild]]s&lt;ref name=Strange40&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used.

==History==
[[File:Bub und Meister.JPG|thumb|A master chimney sweep (right) and his apprentice boy, known as a ''[[Spazzacamini|Spazzacamino]]'', in Italy at the end of the 19th century]]

With the increased urban population that came with the [[Age of Industrialization|age of industrialisation]], the number of houses with chimneys grew apace and the occupation of chimney sweep became much sought-after.

Buildings were higher and the new chimneys' tops were grouped together.&lt;ref name=Strange7&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The routes of flues from individual grates could involve two or more right angles and horizontal angled and vertical sections. The flues were made narrow to create a better draught, 14in by 9in being a common standard. Buckingham Palace had one flue with 15 angles, with the flue narrowing to 9in by 9in.&lt;ref name=Strange64&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimney sweeping was one of the more difficult, hazardous, and low-paying occupations of the era, and consequently has been derided in verse, ballad and pantomime.

The first mechanical sweeper was invented by George Smart in 1803 but was resisted in the UK and the US. [[Joseph Glass]] marketed an improved sweeping machine in 1828; he is credited with being the inventor of the modern chimney sweep's brush.&lt;ref name=Strangexiii&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern US, whites gave up the trade and employed black sweep-boys from the South.&lt;ref name=Strange90/&gt; After regulation finally took hold in 1875 in the UK and the turn of the century in the US, the occupation became romanticized in popular media.

==Great Britain==

Boys as young as four climbed hot [[flue]]s that could be as narrow as 81&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;inches (9x9 inches or 23x23 cm). Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. As soot is [[carcinogen]]ic, and as the boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed, they were prone to [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]]. From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage.&lt;ref name=Strange80&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Shaftesbury]], the philanthropist, led the later campaign.

Chimneys started to appear in Britain around 1200, when they replaced the open fire burning in the middle of the one room house. At first there would be one heated room in the building and chimneys would be large. Over the next four hundred years, rooms became specialized and smaller and many were heated. Sea coal started to replace wood, and it deposited a layer of flammable creosote in the inside surface of the flue, and caked it with soot. Whereas before, the chimney was a vent for the smoke, now the plume of hot gas was used to suck air into the fire, and this required narrower flues.&lt;ref name=Strange6&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, boys rarely climbed chimneys before the [[Great Fire of London]], when [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|building regulations]] were put in place and the design of chimneys was altered. The new chimneys were often angular and narrow, and the usual dimension of the flue in domestic properties was {{convert|9|in|cm}} by {{convert|14|in|cm}}. The master sweep was unable to climb into such small spaces himself and employed climbing boys to go up the chimneys to dislodge the soot. The boys often 'buffed it', that is, climbed in the nude,&lt;ref name=Strange30&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; propelling themselves by their knees and elbows which were scraped raw. They were often put up hot chimneys, and sometimes up chimneys that were alight in order to extinguish the fire. Chimneys with sharp angles posed a particular hazard.&lt;ref name=Waldron390&gt;{{Harvnb|Waldron|1983|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; These boys were apprenticed to the sweep, and from 1778 until 1875 a series of laws attempted to regulate their working conditions, and many first hand accounts were documented and published in parliamentary reports. From about 1803, there was an alternative method of brushing chimneys, but sweeps and their clients resisted the change, preferring climbing boys to the new humane sweeping machines.&lt;ref name=Strange46&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory education was established in 1870 by the [[Education Act 1870]] but it was a further five years before legislation was put in place to license chimney sweeps and finally prevent boys being sent up chimneys.&lt;ref name=Strangexiv&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climbing boys, and sometimes girls,&lt;ref name=mayhew347&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strange19&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; were technically called ''chimney sweeps' apprentices'', and were apprenticed to a ''master sweep'', who, being an adult, was too large to fit into a chimney or flue. He would be paid by the parish to teach orphans or [[pauper]]s the craft. They were totally reliant on him: they or their guardians had signed [[Indenture|papers of indenture]], in front of a magistrate, which bound them to him until they were adults. It was the duty of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Poor Law guardian]]s to apprentice as many [[workhouse|children of the workhouse]] in their care as possible, so as to reduce costs to the parish. The master sweep had duties: to teach the craft and its mysteries, to provide the apprentice with a second suit of clothes, to have him cleaned once a week, allow him to attend church, and not send him up chimneys that were on fire. An apprentice agreed to obey his master.&lt;ref name=Strange12&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once his seven-year-long apprenticeship was completed he would become a [[journeyman]] sweep, and would continue to work for a master sweep of his choice. Other apprentices were sold on to the sweep, or sold by their parents. Prices ranged from 7&amp;nbsp;[[shilling]]s&lt;ref name=Strange21&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 4 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s.

It was generally agreed that six was a good age to train a boy.&lt;ref name=Strange14&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Lord Shaftesbury]] once encountered one of the age of four, they were considered to be too weak.&lt;ref name=Strange14/&gt; A master sweep would have many apprentices, who would start the morning by roaming the streets calling out "''Soot -Oh, Sweep''" or another cry to let the house-owners know they were around; this would remind the owners of the dangers of un-swept chimneys. When engaged, the master sweep would fix a cloth over the [[fireplace]], and the climbing boy would take off his boots and any excess clothes, then get behind it. The flue would be as tall as the house and twist several times, and its dimensions would be 14in by 9in. He would pull his cap down over his face and hold a large flat brush over his head, and wedge his body diagonally in the flue.&lt;ref name=Strange18&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using his back, elbows and knees, he would shimmy up the flue in the manner of a caterpillar&lt;ref name=Strange14/&gt; and use the brush to dislodge loose soot, which would fall over him and down to the bottom, and a scraper to chip away the solid bits, as a smooth chimney was a safe chimney. Having reached the top he would slide back down at speed back to the floor and the soot pile. It was now his job to bag up the soot and carry it back to the master sweep's cart or yard.

[[Soot]] was valuable and could be sold for 9d a [[bushel]] in 1840.&lt;ref name=mayhew353&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apprentice would do four or five chimneys a day. When they first started they scraped their knees and elbows, so the master would harden up their skin by standing them close to a hot fire and rubbing in strong brine using a brush. This was done each evening until the skin hardened.&lt;ref name=Strange14/&gt; The boys got no wages but lived with the master, who fed them. They slept together on the floor or in the cellar under the sacks and the cloth used during the day to catch the soot. This was known as "sleeping black".&lt;ref name="Strange18"/&gt; The boy would be washed by the mistress in a tub in the yard; this might happen as often as once a week, but rarely. One sweep used to wash down his boys in [[the Serpentine]].&lt;ref name=Strange71-72&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=71,72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Nottingham sweep insisted they washed three times a year, for Christmas, [[Whitsun]] and the [[Goose Fair]]. Sometimes, a boy would need to be persuaded to climb faster or higher up the chimney, and the master sweep would light either a small fire of straw or a [[Sulfur|brimstone]] candle, to encourage him to try harder. Another method which also helped stop them from "going off" ([[asphyxia]]ting) was to send another boy up behind him to prick pins into his buttocks or the soles of his feet.&lt;ref name=Strange13&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimneys varied in size. The common flue was designed to be one and a half bricks long by one brick wide, though they often narrowed to one brick square, that is {{convert|9|in|mm}} by {{convert|9|in|mm}} or less.&lt;ref name=Strange16&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the chimney would still be hot from the fire, and occasionally it would actually be on fire.&lt;ref name=Strange21/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strange27&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careless climbing boys could get stuck with their knees jammed against their chins. The harder they struggled the tighter they became wedged. They could remain in this position for many hours until they were pushed out from below or pulled out with a rope. If their struggling caused a fall of soot they would suffocate. Dead or alive the boy had to be removed and this would be done by removing bricks from the side of the chimney.&lt;ref name=Strange26&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the chimney was particularly narrow the boys would be told to "buff it", that is to do it naked,&lt;ref name=Strange71&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise they just wore trousers, and a shirt made from thick rough cotton cloth.

===Health and safety concerns===
The conditions to which these children were subjected caused concern and societies were set up to promote mechanical means for sweeping chimneys and it is through their pamphlets that we have a better idea of what the job could entail. Here a sweep describes the fate of one boy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After passing through the chimney and descending to the second angle of the fireplace the Boy finds it completely filled with soot, which he has dislodged from the sides of the upright part. He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated. An alarm is then given, a brick-layer is sent for, an aperture is perforated in the Flue, and the boy is extracted, but found lifeless. In a short time an inquest is held, and a Coroner's Jury returns a verdict of 'Accidental Death.' "&lt;ref name=Waldron391&gt;{{Harvnb|Waldron|1983|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These however were not the only occupational hazards that chimney sweeps suffered. In the 1817 report to Parliament, witnesses reported that climbing boys suffered from general neglect, and exhibited stunted growth and deformity of the spine, legs, and arms, which were thought to be caused by being required to remain in abnormal positions for long periods of time before their bones had hardened. The knees and ankle joints were the most affected. Sores and inflammation of the eyelids that could lead to loss of sight, were slow in healing because the boy kept rubbing them. Bruises and burns were obvious hazards of having to work in an overheated environment. Cancer of the scrotum was found only in chimney sweeps so was referred to as Chimney Sweep Cancer in the teaching hospitals. Asthma and inflammation of the chest were attributed to the fact that the boys were out in all weathers.&lt;ref name=Mayhew350&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma]]'', which the sweeps called [[soot wart]], didn't occur until the sweep was in his late teens or twenties. It has now been identified as a manifestation of ''[[Squamous-cell carcinoma|scrotal squamous cell carcinoma]]''. It was reported in 1775 by [[Percival Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It is the first industrially related cancer to be found. Potts described it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the [[scrotum]] where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges…in no great length of time it pervades the skin, [[dartos]] and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the [[testicle]], which it inlarges [''sic''], hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the [[Spermatic cord|spermatic process]] into the [[abdomen]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also comments on the life of the boys:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard…they are treated with great brutality…they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, [''sic''] where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to [[puberty]] they become…liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The carcinogen was thought to be [[coal tar]] possibly containing some [[arsenic]].&lt;ref name=Waldron391/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Robert A.|title=Skin Cancer:  Recognition and Management|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|edition=3|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6CMGuQmQi4C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=mule+spinners%27+cancer+squamous+cell+carcinoma.#v=onepage&amp;q=mule%20spinners%27%20cancer%20squamous%20cell%20carcinoma.&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2011|isbn=978-0-470-69563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many deaths caused by accidents, frequently caused by the boy becoming jammed in the flue of a heated chimney, where he could suffocate or be burned to death. Sometimes a second boy would be sent to help, and on occasions would suffer the same fate.&lt;ref name=Mayhew351&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
[[File:Schornsteinfeger, Wanfried, Deutschland, IMG 8113 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Chimney sweeper]]
In 1788, the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788]]: ''An Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices'' was passed, to limit a sweeper to six apprentices, at least 8 years old, but lacked enforcement.&lt;ref name="keydates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/work.htm|title= Key dates in Working Conditions, Factory Acts (Great Britain 1300 – 1899)|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced the Apprenticeship Cap badge. The Act had been partially inspired by the interest in climbing boys shown by [[Jonas Hanway]], and his two publications ''The State of Chimney Sweepers' Young Apprentices'' (1773) and later ''Sentimental History of Chimney Sweeps in London and Westminster'' (1785). He asserted that while Parliament was exercised with the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in the new world it was ignoring the slavery imposed on climbing boys. He looked to [[Edinburgh]] [[Scotland]] where sweeps were regulated by the police, climbing was not allowed and chimneys were swept by the Master Sweep himself pulling bundles of rags up and down the chimney. He did not see how climbing chimneys could be considered a valid apprenticeship, as the only skill obtained was that of climbing chimneys which did not lead to future employment.&lt;ref name=Strange37&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanway advocated that Christianity should be brought into the boys' lives and lobbied for Sunday Schools for the boys. The [[House of Lords|Lords]] removed the proposed clause that Master Sweeps should be licensed, and before [[civil registration]], there was no way that anyone could check if a child was actually eight.

In the same year, David Porter, a humane master sweep, sent a petition to Parliament, and in 1792 published ''Considerations of the Present State of Chimney Sweepers with some Observations on the Act of Parliament intended for their Relief and Regulation''. Though concerned for the boys' welfare he believed that boys were more efficient than any of the new mechanical cleaning machines. In 1796 a society was formed for ''Bettering the Conditions of the Poor'', and they encouraged the reading of Hanway's and Porter's tracts. They had influential members and royal patronage from [[George III]].&lt;ref name=Strange43&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Friendly Society for the Protection and Education of Chimney-Sweepers' Boys had been established in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;(The Times 16 April 1800, Page 1, Column b.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, it was thought by some that a mechanical brush could replace a climbing boy (the Human brush), and members of the 1796 society formed ''The London Society for Superseding the Necessity for Employing Climbing Boys'',&lt;ref name=Strange43/&gt; They ascertained that children had now cleaned flues as small as 7in by 7in, and promoted a competition for a mechanical brush. The prize was claimed by George Smart for what, in effect, was a brush head on a long segmented cane, made rigid by an adjustable cord that passed through the canes.&lt;ref name=Strange44&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1834]] contained many of the needed regulations. It stated that an apprentice must express himself in front of a magistrate that he was'' willing and desirous''. Masters must not take on boys under the age of fourteen. The master could only have six apprentices and an apprentice could not be lent to another master. Boys under fourteen who were already apprenticed, must wear brass cap badges on a leather cap. Apprentices were not allowed to climb flues to extinguish fires. Street cries were regulated.&lt;ref name=Strange65&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was resisted by the master sweeps, and the general public believed that property would be at risk if the flues were not cleaned by a climbing boy.

Also that year building regulations relating to the construction of chimneys were changed.

The [[Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840]] made it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to sweep chimneys. It was widely ignored. Attempts were made in 1852 and 1853 to reopen the issue, another enquiry was convened and more evidence was taken. There was no [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]. The ''Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864'', c37. tightened controls significantly, by authorizing fines and imprisonment for master sweeps who were ignoring the law, giving the police the power of arrest on suspicion and authorizing [[Board of Trade]] inspections of new and remodelled chimneys. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was a main proponent of the Bill.

In February 1875 a twelve-year-old boy, George Brewster, was sent up the [[Fulbourn Hospital]] chimneys by his master, William Wyer. He stuck and smothered. The entire wall had to be pulled down to get him out and although he was still alive, he died shortly afterwards. There was a Coroner's Inquest which returned a verdict of [[manslaughter]]. Wyer was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment with hard labour. Lord Shaftesbury seized on the incident to press his campaign again. He wrote a series of letters to The Times and in September 1875 pushed another Bill through Parliament which finally stopped the practice of sending boys up chimneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-nature.com/free-associations/clark/chap2.html|title=2 The Asylum Years|website=human-nature.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strange31&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Chimney Sweepers Act 1875|Chimney Sweepers Act]]'' was passed in 1875 that required chimney sweepers ''to be authorized by the police to carry on their businesses in the district'', thus providing the legal means to enforce all previous legislation.&lt;ref name="keydates" /&gt;

The history of sweeping in the United States varies little from that in the United Kingdom. Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early settler houses were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties. This caused the authorities to regulate the design of flues. From an early date, fire wardens and inspectors were appointed.

Sweeping of the wide flues of these low buildings was often done by the householder himself, using a ladder to pass a wide brush down the chimney. In a narrow flue, a bag of bricks and brushwood would be dropped down the chimney. But in longer flues climbing boys were used, complete with the tradition of coercion and persuasion using burning straw and pins in the feet and the buttocks.&lt;ref name=Strange90&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeping was not a popular trade. During the eighteenth century the employment of African-American chimney sweeps spread from the south to the north. African-American sweeps faced discrimination and were accused of being inefficient and starting fires. It was claimed that there were fewer fires in London where chimneys were swept by white boys than in New York City. As in the UK, Smart's sweeping machine was available in the US shortly after 1803, but few were used. Unlike the UK, there were no societies formed to advocate for the climbing boys. In fact, the contemporary novel ''[[Tit for Tat (novel)|Tit for Tat]]'' went so far as to deny the Black slave chimney sweeps' hardships by claiming that they had it easier than the London chimney sweeps.&lt;ref name=Strange93&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweeps festivals==
The London boys had one day's holiday a year, the first of May, (Mayday) [[International Labour Day]]. They celebrated by parading through the streets, dancing and twisting with [[Jack in the Green]], merging several folk traditions.&lt;ref name=mayhew370&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Sweeps Festival in [[Santa Maria Maggiore (VB)|Santa Maria Maggiore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museospazzacamino.it/raduno3.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120910024521/http://www.museospazzacamino.it/raduno3.html|deadurl=yes|title=Museo dello Spazzacamino – Home page|date=10 September 2012|archivedate=10 September 2012|website=museospazzacamino.it|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy and in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisureandculture/events/sweepsfestival.aspx Rochester Sweeps Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703010251/http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisureandculture/events/sweepsfestival.aspx |date=3 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the tradition was revived in 1980.
One of the most famous literary works about Chimney Sweeps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doctorchimney.com/16th-century-chimney-sweeping-history-date/|title=Chimney sweep history – Return in Romans – History of chimney sweeping|website=''doctorchimney.com''|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[William Blake]]’s poem, ''[[The Chimney Sweeper]]''.

==Good luck omen==
*In Great Britain it is considered lucky for a [[bride]] to see a chimney sweep on her wedding day. Many modern British sweeps hire themselves out to attend weddings in pursuance of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chimneycleaners.co.uk/weddings.php|title=Chimney sweep weddings|website=''chimneycleaners.co.uk''|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luckysweepleicester.com/history&lt;/ref&gt;
*In  (Germany), [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Romania]] and [[Estonia]] chimney sweeps still wear the traditional all-black uniform with a black or white hat. It is considered good luck to rub or grasp one of your buttons if you pass one in the street.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
*As a [[Lucky symbol]], depictions of chimney sweeps are a popular [[New Year's]] gift in (Germany); either as small ornaments attached to flower bouquets or candy, e.g. [[marzipan]] chimney sweeps.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:German new year's gift, four leaf clovers with chimney sweep ornament.jpeg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their traditional uniform is an all black suit with golden jacket buttons and a black tophat.

==Literature==
Chimney sweeps were often depicted in [[Victorian literature]] as heartless scoundrels who abused their [[child labour|child workers]]. They are typified in ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]'' by [[Charles Kingsley]]. The English poet [[William Blake]] portrayed the chimney sweep as an abused child who hoped for a better life. In both "[[Songs of Innocence]]" and "[[Songs of Experience]]", Blake showcases the life of a common sweeper and exposes those who allowed barbaric actions against them to take place, also said to be the vision behind [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[The Great Train Robbery (novel)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' and the essay "The Praise of Chimney-Sweepers" by [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]; . In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' a particularly vicious chimney sweep called Gamfield wants to take Oliver as an apprentice, but at the last minute the magistrate refuses to sanction the move (''"Mr Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already."'' )&lt;ref name="Strange119+"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep]]" (1845), a [[fairy tale]] by the Danish poet and writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]], a [[porcelain]] chimney sweep sits upon a table top near his love, a porcelain [[shepherdess]]. When the two are threatened, the chimney sweep gallantly conducts his love safely to the rooftop through the stove pipe.&lt;ref name=Strange132&gt;{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clean Willy Williams was an accessory to the gold heist. An apprentice chimney sweep who later became a "snakesman" (a burglar adept at climbing and wriggling through small spaces), he uses his skills to escape from [[Newgate Prison]] and to gain access to the railway office where important keys are stored."

With the development of the newer brush system and the end of child labour, the occupation changed its image to one of agile and good natured men, the chief example being in the book series ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' by [[P. L. Travers]] and the [[Mary Poppins (film)|Walt Disney film adaptation]] which has an extended dance sequence in which the jovial workers celebrate the end of the workday with fearless acrobatics. Their leader, "Bert", played by [[Dick van Dyke]], sings "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" which won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for "[[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]]" in [[37th Academy Awards|1965]]. The chorus refers to the traditional association of chimney sweeps with good luck: ''"Good luck will rub off when I shake 'ands with you, or blow me a kiss ... and that's lucky too"''.

The novel ''[[Die schwarzen Brüder]]'' ("The Black Brothers"), written in 1941 in Switzerland by the Jewish author [[Kurt Held]] but published under the name of his wife [[Lisa Tetzner]], depicts the life of climbing boys, so-called [[Kaminfegerkinder|''Spazzacamini'']], originating from [[Valle Verzasca]] in [[Child labour in Switzerland|Switzerland]], in northern Italy in the 19th century. It has been recreated in [[manga]] as [[Romeo's Blue Skies]].

[[Barbara Vine]]'s novel ''[[The Chimney Sweeper's Boy]]'' has as a central plot device a moth of that name, more formally identified as ''Epichnopterix plumella'', which represents the main character's transformation and identity.

A. M. Watson’s literary fiction novel ''Infants of the Brush: A Chimney Sweep’s Story'' (2017) depicts the lives of climbing boys in 1720s London, focusing on the life of the chimney sweep’s boy at the center of landmark property law case ''[[Armory v Delamirie|Armory v. Delamirie]]''.

Today, chimney sweeps are still operating, as venting systems for coal, [[heating oil]], natural gas, wood and [[pellet stove|pellet]] burning appliances need to be maintained. There is a greater understanding of the dangers of flue deposits and [[carbon monoxide]] and gases from combustion. The standard chimney brush is still used, along with more modern tools (such as vacuums, cameras and special chimney cleaning tools{{Example needed}}). Most sweeps are done from the bottom of the chimney, rather than the top, to prevent the dispersion of dust and debris and because it is safer for the chimney sweep to do the sweeping from this position. Inspection may be done from the bottom or top, or both if accessible.

Most modern chimney sweeps are professionals, and are usually trained to diagnose and repair hazards along with maintenance such as removal of [[creosote|flammable creosote]], firebox and damper repair, and smoke chamber repair. Some sweeps also offer more complicated repairs such as flue repair and relining, crown repair, and [[tuckpointing]] or rebuilding of masonry chimneys and cement crowns.

In the US, the two trade organizations that help to regulate the industry are the [[Modern chimney cleaning#Chimney Safety Institute of America|Chimney Safety Institute of America]] and [[National Chimney Sweep Guild|The National Chimney Sweep Guild]]. Certification for chimney sweeps are issued by two organizations: [[Modern chimney cleaning#Certified Chimney Professionals|Certified Chimney Professionals]] and The [[Chimney Safety Institute of America]], which was first to establish certification and requires sweeps to re-test every three years or demonstrate the commitment to education by earning CEUs through CSIA or the National Fireplace Institute to bypass the test. Certification for chimney sweeps who reline chimneys are issued by Certified Chimney Professionals and the Chimney Safety Institute of America. CEU credits may be obtained from these organizations and regional associations as well as private trainers.

A '''clawback''' or '''clawback provision''' is a special contractual clause typically included in employment contracts by [[financial firm]]s, by which money already paid must be paid back under certain conditions. The term also is in use in [[bankruptcy]] matters where insiders may have raided assets prior to a filing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/clawback_suit_seeks_420k_from_us_transportation_secretary|title=Clawback suit seeks $420K from US transportation secretary concerning in-house counsel pay|last=|first=|date=|website=American Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medicaid#Clawback controversy|Medicaid]], when a state recovers costs of long-term care or covered medical expenses from the estates of deceased Medicaid patients. The aim of the clause is to secure an option for an employer or trustee to limit bonuses, compensation or other remuneration in case of catastrophic shifts in business, bankruptcy, and national crisis as the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], and for states to recoup the cost of administering Medicaid services.

The term '''clawbacks''' or '''claw backs''' can also be used to refer to any money or benefits that have been given out but need to be returned due to special circumstances or events, which are mentioned in a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clawback.asp|title= Clawback | website=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The employees' bonuses are, in a clawback scheme, tied specifically to the performance (or lack thereof) of the [[financial product]](s) the individual(s) may have created and/or sold as part of his or her job expecting a high profit. If the product does indeed do well over a long period of time, and permanently improves the nature of the firm, the bonuses paid to the individual are allowed to be retained by the individual. However, if the product fails, and damages the nature of the firm—even years down the line from the product's inception—then the firm has the inherent right to revoke, reclaim, or otherwise repossess some or all of the bonus amount(s).&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 29, 2010|title=What Good Is Wall Street? Much of what investment bankers do is socially worthless|author=Cassidy, John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_cassidy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research shows managers who are subject to clawback provisions that are newly in place in a company often try to offset their increased risk of bonus clawback by demanding an increase in base salary that is not subject to being clawed back.&lt;ref name="deHaan et al."/&gt;

The prevalence of clawback provisions among Fortune 100 companies increased from lower than 3% prior to 2005 to 82% in 2010.&lt;ref name="CSuite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-suiteinsight.com/index.php/2011/02/focus-on-clawbacks/|title=Focus on Clawbacks|website=C-Suite Insight|date=2011|access-date=2012-05-16|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118164533/http://www.c-suiteinsight.com/index.php/2011/02/focus-on-clawbacks/|archive-date=2013-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing popularity of clawback provisions is likely, at least in part, due to the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, which requires the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to pursue the repayment of incentive compensation from senior executives that are involved in a fraud. In practice, the Securities and Exchange commission has enforced its clawback powers in only a small number of cases.&lt;ref name= "Fried and Shilon"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1798185 |title=Excess-Pay Clawbacks|authors= Fried, Jesse &amp; Shilon, Nitzan |date=2011|journal= Journal of Corporation Law|volume= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010 mandates the SEC to require that U.S. public companies include a clawback provision in their executive compensation contracts that is triggered by any accounting restatement, regardless of fault (whereas the clawback provisions per the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] only applied to intentional fraud). As of mid 2015, this portion of the Dodd-Frank Act has yet to be implemented. &lt;ref name=SEC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2015/33-9861.pdf |title=Listing Standards for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation|accessdate=February 10, 2018|website=SEC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The usual objective of a clawback provision is to deter managers from publishing incorrect accounting information. Academic research finds that voluntarily adopted clawback provisions appear to be effective at reducing both intentional and unintentional accounting errors.&lt;ref name= "deHaan et al."&gt;{{cite news|ssrn=2049442 |title=Does Voluntary Adoption of a Clawback Provision Improve Financial Reporting Quality?|authors= deHaan, Ed &amp; Hodge, Frank &amp; Shevlin, Terry J. |date=2012|work=Contemporary Accounting Research, forthcoming}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also finds that investors have greater confidence in a firm's financial statements after clawback adoption, and that boards of directors place greater weight on accounting numbers in executive bonuses after a clawback is in place (i.e., [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay for performance]] sensitivity increases).

According to a December 2010 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine article,&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; the clawback phenomenon pursued by banks and other financial groups directly and/or indirectly responsible for the financial crisis has been used by the chief administrators of those institutions in order to make the case that they are presently taking tangible self-corrective action to both prevent another crisis (by supposedly dis-incentivizing the sorts of shady investment-product behavior displayed by their people in the recent past) and to appropriately punish any potential future activity of a similar or identical sort. However, the case is made in ''The New Yorker'' article (which cites several professional economists who agree with its perspective) that it is probably unlikely that either result will become the case, and ''The New Yorker'' article also alleges that the people making this argument may not even truly believe it, but are instead promoting it as a sort of [[public relations]] tactic until such time as the impact of the financial crisis fades and similar (perhaps near-identical) abuses of the financial system can slowly and quietly resume, with minimal or no detection by outside forces.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

==Background==
In the past, clawback phenomena have been used primarily in securing [[tax incentive]]s, [[Tax holiday|abatements]], [[tax refund|refund]]s and [[Grant (money)|grants]]. Clawbacks are distinguished from repayments or refunds as they involve a [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]] in addition to a repayment.

The use of tax incentives for attracting jobs and [[capital investment]] has grown over the past twenty odd years to include performance measures from which to gauge a company's growth. Typical measures are:

#number of created jobs over 5 or 10 years
#annual payroll
#amount of capital investment over a similar time frame, and
#amount of depreciated value in a given time.

More unusual measures are retaining a headquarters at a specific site for a period of time, amount of production increase or production cost decrease per unit or the requirement to bring a given technology to a commercial market. The recipient will be required to return the monetary value of the incentive plus a penalty and/or interest to the grantor of the incentive, usually a local or state taxing authority. As the use of incentives mature over time, it is sometimes alleged {{who|date=May 2012}} that the triggering of clawbacks for non performance will likely become more ubiquitous.

Clawbacks can be understood to be the contractual elements that stand between the drive for economic development and community development and the slippery slope of [[corporate welfare]]. They are highly controversial and are utilized as community based guarantees for some expectation of performance. The site location industry normally tries to eliminate or reduce any such promises as part of their negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Business Facilities|url=http://www.businessfacilities.com/bf_03_04_cover5.asp|title=Cover|date=|access-date=2006-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113130202/http://www.businessfacilities.com/bf_03_04_cover5.asp|archive-date=2006-11-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodjobsfirst.org"&gt;{{cite web|website=Good Jobs First|url=http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable_development/reform2.cfm|title=Reform|access-date=2006-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823152332/http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable_development/reform2.cfm|archive-date=2006-08-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodjobsfirst.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iedconline.org/ |website=International Economic Development Council|title=Homem page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in mortgage brokering==
Clawbacks are also used by most banks and lenders to recover money from "unprofitable" home loans. This is usually done when the borrower pays back the loan in a short period of time, usually within 24 months of the loan advancement.

In Australia this fee is usually 0.77% of the total loan amount for loans paid back within the first 12 months after the settlement and 0.385% within 24 months. If a borrower is using a mortgage broker for their home loan, then the broker will usually charge them this amount.

==Use in Medicaid==
See [[Medicaid#Clawback controversy]].

A '''clearing account''' is usually a temporary account containing costs or amounts that are to be transferred to another account. An example is the income summary account containing [[revenue]] and [[expense]] amounts to be transferred to [[retained earnings]] at the close of a fiscal period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/clearing-account.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other example of clearing account is excise clearing account.

In [[economics]], '''fragmentation''' means organization of [[Production (economics)|production]] in which different stages of production are divided among different suppliers that are located in different countries. Now products traded between firms in different countries are components instead of final products. Final products may be sold to outside the region in which fragmentation happens ([[East Asia]]n countries often sell their final products to [[European Union|Europe]] and the [[United States of America|USA]] for example). Producers in [[less developed countries]] get positions of production chain that add less value to final product. Their challenge is to "climb upwards" on transnational production chain. Production chains are often vertical hierarchies in which big multinational companies may be those who sell final products and set production standards for "lesser" producers. This kind of fragmentation is an important part of contemporary globalisation.

'''Frank Aloysius Costa''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 1938 in [[Geelong]]) is an entrepreneur and philanthropist. The Geelong native has been a prominent figure in the region for more than four decades, after inheriting the family's produce business in the late 1950s. The company has become largest service wholesaler of fruit &amp; vegetables in the country with operations in five major states.

In 1998, he became president of the [[Geelong Football Club]].

==History==
Costa was the eldest of five sons born to [[Sicily|Sicilian]] immigrants that moved to Australia in the 1880s. His great-uncle established the '''Geelong Covent Garden''' in 1888 – a produce grocery which he ran until the 1920s, at which time he turned it over to Costa's father.

When Costa was 21, he (along with his brother Adrian) convinced his father to sell the business to them. Costa successfully grew the business with help from his brother, as they made forays into [[wholesaling]]. Although Adrian died in 1972 as a result of an automobile accident, and there were a few business blunders along the way – including the failed development of a state-of-the-art warehouse – the remaining Costa brothers were able to keep the business afloat. By the 1980s, the company had an annual [[Revenue|turnover]] to the tune of A$100&amp;nbsp;million.

In the early 1990s, Costa's fruit operation; Costa Logistics, was forced to co-operate with the [[Melbourne underworld]].[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20675059-24218,00.html]

As of 2006, the company has 800 employees, and a turnover in excess of 800 million. Its head office is an ex-church purchased by the Costa Group and converted into modern offices, located in Myers Street, Geelong.

Costa is the subject of a recent biography,&lt;ref&gt;Des Tobin with foreword by Geoffrey Blainey, (2006), ''Frank Costa. Family, Faith and Footy'', Killaghy Publishing, Malvern, Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; with a foreword by eminent historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] and references to Geelong identities, the Geelong Football Club, and Italian immigrants in Geelong.

==Philanthropy==
According to a 2004 poll, Costa held first place on the list of the regions ''Movers and Shakers."'' It was also a year that saw him (out of frustration) publicly urge the authorities to keep its promise of developing a [[recycling]] and [[irrigation]] facility in the [[Werribee]] region.

Frank Costa is Patron of the Geelong Volunteer Resource Centre and the Geelong Volunteering Network.

==Political scandals==
His push for the recycling/irrigation plant is one of many events has caused some to raise [[conflict of interest]] concerns, as his company was apt to obtain a substantial benefit from the project. In addition to being a [[Committee for Geelong]] board member and being president of the Geelong Football Club, Costa has been involved in some of the most prominent development projects being touted for the region. These include the development in North Geelong near the Ford site and at Point Richards near [[Portarlington, Victoria|Portarlington]].

In early 2006, Costa was embroiled in controversy due to his undisclosed financial support of political campaigns.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Honours==
At the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Costa was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia|Order of Australia]] for service to youth and to the community of Geelong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Aloysius Costa OAM|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=875111&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=9 June 1997|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 years later at the [[2015 Australia Day Honours]], Costa was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the community of Geelong through ongoing roles and contributions to a range of sports, business, religious, medical, educational and social welfare organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officer (AO) of the Order of Australia in the General Division|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2015/Media%20Notes%20-%20AO.pdf|format=pdf|page=[http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2015/Media%20Notes%20–%20AO.pdf#page=8 8]|publisher=[[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]]|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa was also awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] and the [[Australian Sports Medal]] in 2001 for service to the Barwon community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Aloysius Costa|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1120704&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=1 January 2001|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for services to Australia football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Costa|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=970170&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=16 January 2001|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

The '''Getty family''' of the [[United States]] identify with [[George Getty|George Franklin Getty]] and his son [[J. Paul Getty|Jean Paul Getty]] as their patriarchs. In the 20th century they were heavily involved in the [[petroleum industry]]. The Getty family is of [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry from the patrilineal lineage, their ancestors having migrated to [[North America]] from Cullavmor, in what is now [[County Londonderry]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Glassman (2001), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the Getty family have lived in [[England]], including  [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir Paul Getty]] who took [[British citizenship]]. The Getty family is distantly related to Samuel Gettys, founder of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]].

[[George Getty]] (1855–1930) was a lawyer who became an independent oilman in 1904. He was married with one son, a daughter having died in infancy in a typhoid epidemic in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. He lent his son Jean Paul money to invest in oil wells and in 1916, George and Jean Paul incorporated the Getty Oil Company, later to become [[Getty Oil]].

'''Henry D. Sahakian''' was the founder of [[Uni-Mart]], which quickly became one of the largest convenience store and gasoline station chains in the [[United States]].  A Christian Armenian from Iran who moved to the United States in 1956, he studied mechanical engineering at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. There, he founded Unico, a builder of student housing projects.

The venture was a success, but Sahakian sought new challenges and, noting the rapid growth of [[Southland Corporation]]'s [[7-Eleven]] convenience stores throughout the region, flew to the chain's [[Dallas]] headquarters to personally petition for an exclusive territory of stores. When Southland offered him only a single store, Sahakian turned to Munford, Inc., the Atlanta-based owners of the Ma-jik Market convenience store chain, which granted him a 20-year license for convenience stores in the state of [[Pennsylvania]].

Sahakian opened several Ma-jik Market stores in Central Pennsylvania in the early 1970s and by 1980 was operating 90 stores in the state.  In 1981, he severed his relationship with the Maj-jik Market chain and rebranded his stores as Uni-Mart.  His convenience store chain continued to rapidly expand in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] region and eventually grew to nearly 300 stores at its peak.

In addition to housing development and convenience store businesses, Sahakian and his family have also owned [[hotel]] and [[automotive]] [[oil change]] specialty shop franchises in the [[State College, Pennsylvania]] area.

==Philanthropy==
Henry Sahakian, and his wife Seda, established the Henry D. Sahakian Family Fund to help offer financial support to various [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]] [[charitable organization|charitable organizations]].

'''Intent scale translation'''  is a mathematical technique used by [[marketing|marketers]] to convert stated purchase intentions into purchase probabilities, that is, into an estimate of actual buying behaviour.  It takes [[statistical survey|survey data]] on consumers purchase intentions and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.

A survey might ask a [[questionnaire construction|question]] using a five-point [[scale (social sciences)|scale]] such as :

&lt;small&gt;
Which is most true about product X?
:___ I definitely would use product X
:___ I probably would use product X
:___ I might use product X
:___ I probably would not use product X
:___ I definitely would not use product X
&lt;/small&gt;
A marketing researcher will first assign numerical values to these intention categories. If the numbers range from zero to one, they can be thought of as intent probabilities. This is a typical example:
:definitely -&gt; .99
:probably -&gt; .75
:maybe -&gt; .5
:probably not -&gt; .25
:definitely not -&gt; .01

Next, the researcher uses a predefined functional relationship to convert the stated intentions into estimates of actual purchase probabilities. The diagram that follows illustrates one such translation function. If a survey respondent were to choose a response of “definitely” and an intent probability of .99 was assigned to that category, then the actual probability of purchase could be read off the vertical axis. The translation function gives a value of about .8, indicating the specifiers of the function feel that not all people that claim they definitely intend to purchase will actually purchase.

&lt;!------------------------Diagram---------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;div style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:5.5em;text-align:center"&gt;[[image:Intent scale translation.png|alt text]]&lt;br&gt;''Intent Translation''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

If a survey respondent were to choose a response of “probably not” and an intent probability of .25 was assigned to that category, then the actual probability of purchase could be read off the vertical axis as .35, indicating the specifiers of the function feel that some people that claim they probably will not purchase will actually purchase.
 
Other purchase intention/rating translations include [[logit analysis in marketing|logit analysis]] and the [[preference-rank translation]].

{{Business administration}}
'''International business''' refers to the trade of [[Goods and services|goods, services,]] technology, capital and/or knowledge across [[national borders]] and at a global level. 

It involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].

To conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.

== Overview ==
"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), Microsoft (MSFT), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises. 

Multinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[Accounting standard|accounting standards]], [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[Trade agreement|trade agreements]], [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.

One of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckley P.J. (2010) Stephen Hymer: Three Phases, One Approach?. In: Foreign Direct Investment, China and the World Economy. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.

There were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work. The first phase of Hymer's work was his dissertation in 1960 called the ''[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27375 International Operations of National Firms]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hymer|first=Stephen H.|date=1960|others=Charles P. Kindleberger., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Economics|title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27375|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=DSpace@MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.

According to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".

Hymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.

Among modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Founder (disambiguation)|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].

==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==
The conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].

===Operations===
All firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business:  Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=382|edition=10|url=https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/books/007811277X|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business:  Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=383|edition=10|url=https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/books/007811277X|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.

Once a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=453–454|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=454|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=454–455|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=456–457|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[Partnership|partnerships]]). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=457–458|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of operations====
[[Export]]s and [[import]]s of merchandise: 
* Merchandise exports: goods exported{{Em dash}}not including services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/merchandise-exports/ What is Merchandised Exports]. The Law Dictionary. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Merchandise imports: The physical good or product that is imported into the respective country. Countries import products or goods that their country lacks in. An example of this is that [[Colombia]] must import cars since there is no Colombian car company.
*[[Offshoring|Service exports]]: {{As of|2018}}, the fastest growing export sector. The majority of the companies create a product that requires installation, repairs, and troubleshooting,  Service exports is simply a resident of one country providing a service to another country.

The second factor is technological change, particularly the developments in communication, information processing, and transportation technologies.

===Choice of entry mode in international business===

Strategic variables affect the choice of entry mode for [[multinational corporation]] expansion beyond their [[Domestic market|domestic markets]]. These variables are global concentration, global synergies, and global strategic motivations of MNC.
* Global concentration: many MNEs share and overlap markets with a limited number of other corporations in the same [[industry]].
* Global synergies: the reuse or sharing of resources by a corporation and may include marketing departments or other inputs that can be used in multiple markets. This includes, among other things, [[Brand awareness|brand name recognition]].
* Global strategic motivations: other factors beyond entry mode that are the basic reasons for corporate expansion into an additional market. These are strategic reasons that may include establishing a foreign outpost for expansion, developing sourcing sites among other strategic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, W. C., &amp; Hwang, P. (1992). [http://www.monman.com/global-strategy-and-multinationals-entry-mode-choice Global strategy and multinationals' entry mode choice]. Journal of International Business Studies, 23(1), 29. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of businesses===
* Entry modes: Export/import, wholly owned subsidiary, merger or acquisition, alliances and joint ventures, licensing&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, F., Doh, J. P. (2015).  International Management: Culture, Strategy and Behavior, 9th edition. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07786244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modes: [[import]]ing and [[exporting]], [[tourism]] and [[transportation]], [[licensing]] and [[franchising]], [[turnkey]] operations, [[management]] [[contracts]], [[direct investment]] and [[portfolio investments]].
* Functions: [[marketing]], global [[manufacturing]] and [[supply chain management]], [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[human resources]]
* Overlaying alternatives: choice of countries, organization and [[control mechanisms]]

===Physical and social factors===
* Geographical influences: There are many different geographic factors that affect international business. These factors are: the geographical size, the [[Climate change|climatic challenges]] happening throughout the world, the [[Natural resource|natural resources]] available on a specific territory, the [[Population density|population distribution]] in a country, etc.&lt;ref name=witiger&gt;
Witiger, (2012). [https://web.archive.org/web/20051110172534/http://www.witiger.com/internationalbusiness/physicalgeographicenvironment.htm The Physical/Geographic Environment]. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social factors: Political policies: political disputes, particularly those that result in the military confrontation, can [[Economics of war|disrupt]] trade and investment.
* Legal policies: domestic and international laws play a big role in determining how a company can operate overseas.
* Behavioral factors: in a foreign environment, the related disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology are helpful for managers to get a better understanding of values, attitudes, and beliefs.
*[[Economic forces]]: economics explains country differences in costs, currency values, and market size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Risks:===
* '''Faulty Planning'''

To achieve success in penetrating a foreign market and remaining profitable, efforts must be directed towards the planning and execution of Phase I. The use of conventional [[SWOT analysis]], [[market research]], and cultural research, will give a firm appropriate tools to reduce risk of failure abroad. Risks that arise from poor planning include: large expenses in marketing, administration and product development (with no sales); disadvantages derived from local or federal laws of a foreign country, lack of popularity because of a [[Market saturation|saturated market]], vandalism of physical property due to instability of country; etc. There are also cultural risks when entering a foreign market. Lack of research and understanding of local customs can lead to alienation of locals and brand dissociation.&lt;ref name="okolo2"&gt;Okolo, S. (n.d.). Global Business: Risks in International Business. [online] Globalpaarisite.blogspot.com.es. Available at: http://globalpaarisite.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/risks-in-international-business.html [Accessed 10 May 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic risks can be defined as the uncertainties and untapped opportunities embedded in your strategic intent and how well they are executed. As such, they are key matters for the board and impinge on the whole business, rather than just an isolated unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/advisory/consulting.html|title=Consulting|first=|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|date=|website=PwC|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Operational risk'''
A company has to be conscious about the production costs to not waste time and money. If the expenditures and costs are controlled, it will create an efficient production and help the internationalization.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Operational risk is the prospect of loss resulting from inadequate or failed procedures, systems or policies; employee errors, systems failure, fraud or other criminal activity, or any event that disrupts business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/operational-risk|title=What is operational risk? - Definition from WhatIs.com|author=|date=|website=techtarget.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Political risk''' 

How a government governs a country ([[governance]]) can affect the operations of a firm. The government might be [[Corruption|corrupt]], hostile, or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]; and may have a negative image around the globe. A firm's reputation can change if it operates in a country controlled by that type of government.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Also, an unstable political situation can be a risk for multinational firms. [[Elections]] or any unexpected political event can change a country's situation and put a firm in an awkward position.&lt;ref name=heinsz&gt;J. Henisz, W. and A. Zelner, B. (2010). [https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-hidden-risks-in-emerging-markets|The Hidden Risks in Emerging Markets]. Harvard Business Review. Accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Political risks are the likelihood that political forces will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. Political risk tends to be greater in countries experiencing [[social unrest]]. When political risk is high, there is a high probability that a change will occur in the country's political environment that will endanger foreign firms there. Corrupt foreign governments may also [[Expropriation|take over the company without warning]], as seen in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Charles H.L Hill"&gt;Charles H.L Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Technological risk'''

Technological improvements bring many benefits, but some disadvantages as well. Some of these risks include "lack of [[Information security|security in electronic transactions]], the [[Non-recurring engineering|cost of developing new technology]] ... the fact that this new technology may fail, and, when all of these are coupled with the outdated existing technology, [the fact that] the result may create a dangerous effect in doing business in the international arena."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt;
* '''Environmental risk''' 

Companies that establish a subsidiary or factory abroad need to be conscious about the externalizations they will produce, as some may have negative effects such as [[Noise pollution|noise]] or [[pollution]].  This may cause aggravation to the people living there, which in turn can lead to a conflict. People want to live in a clean and quiet environment, without pollution or unnecessary noise. If a conflict arises, this may lead to a negative change in customer's perception of the company. Actual or potential threat of adverse effects on living organisms and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, resource depletion, etc., arising out of an organization's activities is considered to be risks of the environment. As new business leaders come to fruition in their careers, it will be increasingly important to curb business activities and externalizations that may hurt the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|title=What is environmental risk? definition and meaning|author=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Economic risk''' 
These are the economic risks explained by Professor Okolo: "This comes from the inability of a country to meet its financial obligations. The changing of foreign-investment or/and domestic fiscal or monetary policies. The effect of exchange-rate and interest rate make it difficult to conduct international business."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Moreover, it can be a risk for a company to operate in a country and they may experience an unexpected economic crisis after establishing the subsidiary.&lt;ref name=heinsz /&gt; Economic risks is the likelihood that economic management will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. In practice, the biggest problem arising from economic mismanagement has been inflation. Historically many governments have expanded their domestic money supplying misguided attempts to stimulate economic activity.&lt;ref name="Charles H.L Hill"/&gt;
* '''Financial risk'''

According to Professor Okolo: "This area is affected by the currency exchange rate, government flexibility in allowing the firms to [[Repatriation|repatriate]] profits or funds outside the country. The [[devaluation]] and inflation will also affect the firm's ability to operate at an efficient capacity and still be stable."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Tax|taxes]] that a company has to pay might be advantageous or not. It might be higher or lower in the host countries. Then "the risk that a government will indiscriminately change the laws, regulations, or contracts governing an investment—or will fail to [[Enforcement|enforce]] them—in a way that reduces an investor's [[Financial return|financial returns]] is what we call 'policy risk.'"&lt;ref name=heinsz /&gt;
* '''Terrorism'''

[[Terrorism]] is a voluntary act of violence towards a group(s) of people. In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt;
* '''Bribery'''

[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.

==Factors towards globalization==
There has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.

{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}

*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].
*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.
*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Competition]] has become more global.
*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.
*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.

==Importance of international business education==
* Most companies are either [[international]] companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.
* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.
* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].
* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.
* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.

Managers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.

To maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.

===Importance of language and cultural studies===

A considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:
*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers
*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]
*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue

In many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:
*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market
*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos 
*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".
*Associating with people who do not know several languages.
*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[Writing system|writing systems]] of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.

===Importance of studying international business===

The international business standards focus on the following:
*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;
*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;
*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;
*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and
*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.
By focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.

There is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally. For example, at [[Sony|Sony Corporation]], only fifty percent of its employees are Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS|last=|first=ASWATHAPPA|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259051166|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business people with an education in international business also had a significantly higher chance of being sent abroad to work under the international operations of a firm.

'''James Reynolds Bath''' (born August 18, 1936) is a Texas businessman who has business interests in aircraft sales and leasing and real estate. He is best known for his business relationships with Saudi businessmen [[Salem bin Laden]] and [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]].

==Biography==
Bath was born in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]]. In 1965, he moved to Houston, where he became an aircraft broker.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Craig. ''House of Bush House of Saud''. Scribner. 2004. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5339-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Bath met [[Salem bin Laden]] when bin Laden was interested in purchasing a used aircraft.&lt;ref name = "Coll"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Reprint| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-0-14-311481-9| last = Coll| first = Steve| title = The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century| location = New York| date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salem bin Laden was the son of [[Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden|Mohammed bin Laden]], founder of the [[Saudi Binladin Group]], one of the largest construction companies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Salem was the oldest of Mohammed's 54 children, and a half brother of [[Osama bin Laden]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this acquaintance, Bath eventually became bin Laden's business representative in the United States, representing him in a number of business deals, including real estate, aircraft services, and banking. Through bin Laden, Bath also met Khalid bin Mahfouz, the son of Salem Bin Mahfouz, founder of [[National Commercial Bank]], now the largest bank in Saudi Arabia, and for a time represented him as well.&lt;ref name = Coll /&gt;

==Bath and George W. Bush==
Bath was also an acquaintance of former president [[George W. Bush]], whom he met when both men were serving in the Texas Air National Guard in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  After Bush started his first business, [[Arbusto Energy]], Bath invested $50,000 in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 116&lt;/ref&gt;  A former business partner of Bath, Charles White, who was involved in a number of suits against Bath, claimed in a 2003 interview with [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] that the investment in fact came from bin Mahfouz and bin Laden, and amounted to over a million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Conspiracy Theories: The Saudi Connection |work=CBC News: the fifth estate |accessdate=2015-10-18 |date=2003-10-29 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/conspiracytheories/saudi.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710092544/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/conspiracytheories/saudi.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bush and Bath have denied this, and according to journalist Craig Unger, who examined the relationship between the Bushes and Saudi financiers in his 2004 book ''House of Bush, House of Saud'' there is no evidence to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early Stages===
MTV was established in 1991&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Lebanon's MTV News Defies Critics, Rolls With the Punches| work = The Huffington Post| accessdate = 2016-04-16| date = 2011-08-22| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/magda-abufadil/murr-television-lebanon_b_931657.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a TV channel that sought to cater to the complexity and richness of its Lebanese viewers’ identity by creating a balanced mix of local, Arab, and western media content, with a special emphasis on producing local programming that is tailored to its audience and reflects their aspirations and values.

===Embarking on the Political Scene===
In November 1994, MTV embarked on the political scene,&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1332&amp;context=asc_papers&lt;/ref&gt; launching its local news broadcasts along with a number of distinct political and socio-economic shows.

===MTV Shut Down===
In 2002, the Government, engaged in an unlawful process, illegally shut MTV down&lt;ref&gt;http://tbsjournal.arabmediasociety.com/Archives/Fall02/Murr.html&lt;/ref&gt; indefinitely.
On August 16, 2005, the Lebanese Parliament voted unanimously for the amendment of the Electoral Law, after which the rights of MTV were re-instituted&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lebanonwire.com/0805/05081601AP.asp&lt;/ref&gt; along with those of an entire sector and public.

===MTV Today===
In 2009 MTV has re-launched to continue on its mission and vision and has fast become a leader on the local and regional TV scene.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/magda-abufadil/murr-television-lebanon_b_931657.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/reportsfeatures/mtv_returns1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hosted by [[Kai Ryssdal]] since 2005, the show is produced and distributed by [[American Public Media]], in association with the [[University of Southern California]]. Marketplace is produced in [[Los Angeles]] with bureaus in [[New York City|New York]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[London]], and [[Shanghai]].

==History==
''Marketplace'' was founded in 1989 by [[Jim Russell (journalist)|James Russell]] in [[Long Beach, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.programdoctor.com | title=The Program Doctor | publisher=Jim Russell Productions | date= | accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/about/bios/russell.shtml| title =Jim Russell General Manager, Marketplace Productions| website = They Savvy Traveler| access-date = 22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/about/bios/yore.shtml| title =J.J.

The program survived through the help of the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), and later, in 1990, with the underwriting of [[General Electric]].&lt;ref name="USC" /&gt; USC became the only university in the US at the time to produce a daily news program distributed nationally.

The three shows share reporters and editorial staff.  ''Marketplace Money'' was replaced with ''Marketplace Weekend'' in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.apmstations.org/2014/04/09/marketplace-weekend-launches-june-28/|title=Marketplace Weekend launches June 28|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">The [[New York (state)|New York]] '''Disability Benefits Law''' ('''DBL''') is article 9 of the Workers' Compensation Law (which is itself chapter 67 of the [[Consolidated Laws of New York]]) and creates a [[State disability benefits|state disability insurance]] program designed to provide employees with some level of income replacement in case of disability caused off-the-job.

==Eligibility==
To be required to have DBL coverage for its employees, a company must employ at least one person besides the proprietor within the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Full-time employees are eligible for coverage after four consecutive weeks of work, and part-time employees are eligible after their twenty-fifth day of employment.

Out of state employees can be covered under some DBL policies, but the employer must have some [[New York (state)|New York]] employees in order to attain DBL coverage.

==Cost and rates==
DBL [[insurance]] groups are divided up into those covering fewer than 50 employees and those with 50 or more employees.

Employers with less than 50 employees are written at rates which are fixed for all groups, but that vary from one insurance carrier to another. Rates for employers with less than 50 employees are usually written as a dollar cost per employee, per month. These rates are further divided into separate male and female rates (which are higher than the male rates), to reflect the impact that pregnancy has on DBL claims. Many carriers offer a discounted rate for employers willing to pay all of their premium at the beginning of the year. If a carrier offers this option, the rate will be expressed as a dollar amount per male per year, and per female per year.

Carriers are prevented by the state [[Worker's compensation]] Board from raising or lowering their rates for groups with fewer than 50 lives. If a carrier's overall loss ratio (claims paid divided by premium) for their groups with less than 50 employees is too low, then the [[Worker's compensation]] Board may force the carrier to lower their rates for all of the groups with fewer than 50 covered lives.

Employers with 50 or more employees are not given fixed rates, but will request a quote from various insurance carriers through an insurance agent or broker. These rates can vary considerably and are based on the overall risk factors of the case. Carriers are permitted to review these groups and increase or decrease the rates based on the claims paid to the group and the premiums that the group pays to the carrier. These reviews are generally conducted quarterly, and the carriers will issue letters to the policyholders and their insurance brokers indicating the proposed changes in rate.

Rates for cases with more than 50 employees are usually given as a dollar amount per employee, per month (called a "per capita rate") with no division into male- and female-specific rates, or as a dollar amount per $100 of covered payroll. Other, less common rate structures include offering a dollar amount per male and per female (as with the groups with less than 50 employees), and offering a dollar amount per $10 of benefit.

==Benefits==
As of 2006, DBL offers a benefit of 50% of weekly wages to a maximum of $170 per week of benefit. The normal waiting period for DBL benefits to start is seven days, and benefits can extend to a maximum duration of 26 weeks.

It is possible for carriers to offer benefits that extend beyond the statutory DBL coverage known as "enhanced" or "enriched" DBL. This extended coverage usually takes the form of a higher maximum benefit, but can also include shorter waiting periods or a longer maximum duration. Carriers take these factors into account when underwriting DBL coverage, and so enriched DBL is often more costly than statutory DBL coverage.

==Premium payment==
An employer is allowed, but not required, to collect contributions from its employees to offset the cost of providing benefits. An employee's contribution is computed at the rate of one-half of one percent of his/her wages, but no more than sixty cents a week (WCL §209).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/offthejob/IntroToLaw_DB.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paid Family Leave==
In 2016, Governor Cuomo signed into law the Paid Family Leave policy. Starting January 1, 2018, the New York State Paid Family Leave Program provides New Yorkers job-protected, paid leave to bond with a new child, care for a loved one with a serious health condition or to help relieve family pressures when someone is called to active military service. Coverage for this benefit will generally be provided as a rider to the DBL insurance policy. For employers who are not required to have DBL coverage, PFL coverage may be obtained on a stand-alone basis. (NYCRR 380).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ny.gov/programs/new-york-state-paid-family-leave&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ny.gov/PFL/pfl-regs-text-summary-revised.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) Plc. is the manager and administrator of the electricity pool (‘The Pool’) in the Nigerian electricity supply industry (NESI).  It was incorporated on the 29th day of July 2010 and is 100% owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.

In line with the “Roadmap to Power Sector Reform” of August 2010, and, in fulfillment of the requirements of EPSRA, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading PLC, (NBET) aka the Bulk Trader, was incorporated on July 29, 2010 as the SPV for carrying out, under license from NERC, the bulk purchase and resale function contemplated by the EPSRA. As such NBET has been set up “engage in the purchase and resale of electric power and ancillary services from independent power producers and from the successor generation companies”

==Background==
Nigerian’s deficient power sector supply has been a challenge that the past three presidential administrations have steadfastly sought to address. In 2001, the federal Government, in a bid to address the deficiency in power sector supply, adopted the National Electric power policy for the reform of the sector. Following suit, the '''Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA)''', was passed into law in March 2005. A key thrust of the sector from public to private sector. In furtherance of this goal, the Act saw the creation of the '''Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)''' which assumed the assets, Liabilities and employees of the erstwhile '''Nigeria Electricity Power Authority (NEPA)'''; the subsequent unbundling of PHCN into 18 successor companies, the establishment of the Rural '''Electrification Agency (REA)''' and the provision for the establishment of two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to undertake electric power trading and management of extant liabilities respectively

==History==
'''NBET''') was incorporated on July 29, 2010, in line with the "Roadmap to Power Sector Reform" and, in fulfillment of the requirements of '''Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA)''', 2005 for a "trading licensee holding a bulk purchase and resale license" to "engage in the purchase and resale of electrical power and ancillary services from independent power producers and from the successor generation companies".

On August 23, 2011, the President, '''Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan''', GCFR, inaugurated a nine-person Board of Directors that included Mr. Rumundaka Wonodi as its pioneer Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (2011 - 2016).&lt;ref name="GCFR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://businessnews.com.ng/2011/08/23/president-jonathan-inaugurates-nigerian-bulk-electricity-trading-board/|title=President Jonathan inaugurates Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading board|date=2011-08-23|website=Nigeria Business News|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NBET's''' power purchase agreements (PPAs) with independent power producers are backed by credit enhancement instruments offered by the FGN.

===Objectives===
To put in place an effective transaction environment which minimizes risk and allocates it fairly to the parties best able to manage it

To  implement a procurement process that is transparent and will result in the economic procurement of needed power

To have all existing and new power capacity under contract by 2016, although the commercial operation date when this capacity comes on line may be latter

To ensure efficient settlement in the short term until this function is subsumed under the Market Operator

To become sustaining as soon as practical  thereby minimizing the cost to the FGN

To be ready to novate contracts and wind up as soon as the suppliers are ready to take on their own procurement

To enter into contracts that are well structured and managed in a manner that precludes recourse to any credit guarantee instrument

===Services===
NBET purchases electricity from the Generating Companies through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and sells to the Distribution Companies through Vesting Contracts. The Generating Companies include the privatized PHCN successor companies, the Niger Delta Power Holding Companies (NIPPs), the already existing Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the new IPPs.

'''Our Top Priorities includes:'''

•	Management and administration of the financial flows for the physical supplies on the network.

•	Operation of a competitive market that encourages efficient value discovery for commodity and capacity.

•	Promotion of a contracts-based market that allocates risks efficiently to parties responsible for them.

•	Formulation and advisory on policies for efficient system settlement and least possible cost incentives for maintaining the transportation network within its acceptable energy, frequency responses and voltage tolerances.

'''''Nightly Business Report''''' is an American [[business journalism|business]] [[news magazine]] television program that has aired weeknights on [[public television]] stations since January 22, 1979. Internationally the show is seen on [[CNBC Europe]] (Friday edition only) and [[CNBC Asia]].

From January 22, 1979 to March 1, 2013, the show was produced at [[WPBT]] in [[Miami, Florida]]. In February 2013, [[CNBC]] purchased the program and closed its Miami operations. [[Tyler Mathisen]] joined [[Susie Gharib]] as co-anchor when it relaunched on March 4, 2013 to coincide with Gharib's return to CNBC after leaving it in 1998 to join ''NBR''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/02/21/3246373/cnbc-purchases-rights-to-miamis.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gharib left ''NBR'' on December 31, 2014; she was replaced on January 5, 2015 by [[Sue Herera]], previously Mathisen's co-anchor on CNBC's ''[[Power Lunch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Roush, [http://talkingbiznews.com/1/gharib-leaves-nightly-business-report-replaced-by-herera/ Gharib leaves “Nightly Business Report,” replaced by Herera], ''Talking Biz News'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 2018, Mathisen left the program, and was replaced three days later by original ''Power Lunch'' anchor  [[Bill Griffeth]] who reunited with his former ''PL'' co-anchor Herera.

==Format==
The daily program consists of reports on the changes in the [[stock market]], [[index (economics)|indices]], and [[stocks]] of note for the day, including the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], [[NASDAQ]], the [[S&amp;P 500]], and other major markets, as well as [[interviews]] with important [[business]] persons, generally [[CEO]]s of major [[companies]] as well as economists, market analysts and policy makers.

Special programs on market holidays depart from this format, and often deal with a single subject or theme; [[New Year's Day]] and [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] editions tend to focus on retrospectives and predictions for the past and coming fiscal periods. The program often concludes with a commentary. Segments within the program include ''Market Monitor'', ''Street Critique'', ''Women in Leadership'', and ''Planet Forward'' to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;"Series." NBR | Nightly Business Report.

==History==
The idea for a business news program had come from Susan J. Moran, a WPBT employee, also in Grad School @ Univ. of Miami, School for Advanced Study of International Relations.  Moran saw a lack of business &amp; economic content on TV perceived partly because of her economic studies.  She pitched a business TV show idea to then Executive Producer, Ed Waglin, bounced around by businessmen on the WPBT Board &amp; hence, created. Linda O'Bryon, who was WPBT's News Director at the time, coalesced the effort to get NBR on the air in the fall of 1978. Moran developed the program concept and the editorial staff expanded to launch NBR. [[Paul Kangas]] was among the first to join, signing on as its stock market commentator. Kangas always signed off each broadcast using his trademark phrase, "I'm Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys!" (a pun on "the best of goodbyes") O'Bryon and Merwin Sigale were the first co-anchors. The editorial/production team that launched the program included WPBT veterans Rodney Ward, Bruce Eibe and Jeff Huff, and Jack Kahn, who was the program's first producer. 

Starting in January 22, 1979, NBR launched on 125 public stations around the country. The first regular commentator on the program was [[Alan Greenspan]], then a private economist, who remained as an NBR commentator until his appointment as Fed chief in 1987. A number of public television stations supplemented the program's newsgathering efforts by serving as "bureaus" for the program.

In 1989, Jim Wicks was named co-anchor, and moved from the flagship station of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto where he was main anchor. At the end of his contract, Wicks moved to ABC News in Cleveland. He has since left the television news business and returned to his motion picture career where he got his start. He works in post-production as a film colorist.&lt;ref&gt;jimwicks.com, https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimwicks/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, financial journalist [[Susie Gharib]] joined the anchor desk with [[Paul Kangas]]. Gharib anchors from the heart of New York's financial district, while Kangas remained at the program's production center in Miami. 

During the 1990s, ''NBR'' was co-produced by [[Reuters]], and later its subsidiary, [[Bridge Information Systems]].

NBR is also seen internationally through [[WORLDNET Television and Film Service|Worldnet]], the U.S. Radio and Television Armed Services network and on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] in Australia and [[Face TV|Triangle Television]] in New Zealand. Audio of the program airs on [[Sirius XM]] satellite radio at 7pm ET. NBR operates three reporting bureaus with full-time staff members as well as bureaus in Denver, Silicon Valley, and Phoenix operated in partnership with the public television stations in those markets.

Over the years, NBR has received numerous awards. In 2005, for extended coverage of China's emergence as an international economic power, and in 2006 the website was honored with a took the helm from Linda O’Bryon in 2006, serving as executive editor and senior vice president through 2011. O'Bryon is currently President and CEO of [[South Carolina ETV]].  

[[Paul Kangas]]'s last broadcast for ''Nightly Business Report'' was on December 31, 2009, ending a 30-year run.&lt;ref name="PBS revamps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Elizabeth|title=PBS revamps its business news, hoping to revive a stodgy image|work=[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]|date=January 1, 2010|location=[[Bend, Oregon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following week, on January 4, 2010, Tom Hudson took over as NBR's anchor, broadcasting from Miami&lt;ref name="PBS revamps"/&gt; and reporting on topics such as Federal Reserve interest rate policy, corporate governance and shareholder activism as well as providing insights to daily market activity. Prior to co-anchoring ''Nightly Business Report'', he was host and managing editor of the nationally syndicated financial television program ''First Business''. In July 2011, Tom was named Managing Editor and Co-anchor, a newly combined position with both editorial and managerial responsibility.

In August 2010, it was announced that WPBT-TV had sold the show to NBR Worldwide Inc., a newly formed privately held company headed by Mykalai Kontilai who became the majority owner of the program. Kontilai, an entrepreneur in the Instructional Television Distribution (ITV) industry. Gary Ferrell, a former president and chief executive of North Texas Public Broadcasting (parent company of [[KERA-TV]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]), is the company's CFO. The sale was first proposed in February.&lt;ref name="nyt100818"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/business/media/19pbs.html |title= ‘Nightly Business Report’ Sold by PBS Station | date= August 18, 2010| author=Elizabeth Jensen |  publisher=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to WPBT, the station will continue to be associated with the show as a presenting station, and the sale reflects their assessment that NBR Worldwide Inc. has "the ideas and resources and potential to take it to the next level" and "can do more things with it than WPBT could."&lt;ref name="nyt100818"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cur100823"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.current.org/news/news1015nbr-kontilai.shtml |title= ‘Buyer will take Nightly Business Report to a new level: WPBT sells to entrepreneur with history of legal disputes' | date= August 23, 2010| author=Dru Sefton | publisher=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]]| accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Schneider, president and CEO of WPBT, said the staff and editorial team won't change and "Nobody loses their job as a result of this."&lt;ref name="mh100809"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/08/19/1782428/nightly-business-report-has-new.html |title= ‘Nightly Business Report’ has new owner | date= August 19, 2010| author=Kelly House |  publisher=[[The Miami Herald]]| accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until the name changed, the program was carried under the "Community Television Foundation of South Florida, Inc." banner and produced by NBR Enterprises, Inc./WPBT Miami.

Schneider's promises proved short-lived. In November 2010, NBR Worldwide Inc. announced a restructuring of the ''Nightly Business Report'' staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/nightly-business-report-cuts-jobs/ | work=The New York Times | first=Elizabeth | last=Jensen | title=‘Nightly Business Report' Cuts Jobs | date=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That restructuring resulted in job cuts for four on-air contributors, half the reporting staff, including Scott Gurvey (NY bureau chief), Stephanie Dhue (Washington), Jeff Yastine (Miami) and Jamila Trindle (Washington), in addition to founding producer Jack Kahn and three other behind-the-scenes personnel.&lt;ref name="nyt101121"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/media/22nightly.html |title= A Figure at Troubled Companies Has Big Plans for PBS Program | date= November 21, 2010| author=Elizabeth Jensen |  publisher=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2010, NBR Worldwide Inc. announced the promotions of Rodney Ward from Executive Editor to Executive VP of Special Projects. Ward's former executive editor duties were assumed by managing editor Wendie Feinberg, who was also promoted to VP/Managing Editor. Those changes also didn't last long. On July 11, 2011, following the decision of PBS to drop the broadcast from its national schedule and cut all funding, NBR Worldwide Inc. announced the departures of Rodney Ward as Executive VP of Special Projects, and Wendie Feinberg, as VP/Managing Editor. In a press release,&lt;ref name="nbrpr"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nbr.com/press/release/nbr-worldwide-appoints-hudson-managing-editor-and-co-anchor-of-nightly-busi#.UPSNkc8o7cs |title=NBR Worldwide Inc. announced departures.... | date=July 18, 2011 | accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBR Worldwide said the moves were "...part of its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and maximize resources." CEO Mykalai Kontilai said Miami-based anchor Tom Hudson would assume the role and title of Managing Editor, in addition to his current on-air duties.

In November 2011, Rick Ray succeeded Kontilai as CEO after Kontilai sold the company to Atalaya Capital Management, a private equity firm based out of NYC. Ray is now CEO of NBR Worldwide Inc. and the executive producer of NBR. Gary Ferrell also departed the company at this time. Several additional members of the editorial staff were also fired.

In December 2012, Atalaya fired another seven NBR editorial employees, including Chicago Bureau Chief Diane Eastabrook. The program also announced the complete closing of its Chicago bureau, leaving it with staff reporters only in New York and Washington, D.C. Of the terminated employees, NBR Managing Editor Tom Hudson said, "I consider it an honor to call them colleagues." &lt;ref name="tos121212"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/15935416/‘nightly-business-report’-cuts-jobs-closes-chicago-bureau |title= Nightly Business Report cuts jobs, closes Chicago Bureau | date= December 12, 2012|author=Robert Feder |  publisher=[[Time Out Chicago]] | accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2013, NBR aired its final broadcast under the production of WPBT. Effective March 4, 2013, CNBC would produce NBR. As a result, anchor Tom Hudson and many other correspondents were laid off, and the show's Miami studios were shut down as well. CNBC's Tyler Mathisen replaced Hudson, and anchored alongside Susie Gharib from CNBC Global Headquarters in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]].  As previously mentioned, Gharib left NBR at the end of 2014 and was replaced with Sue Herera, who was previously Mathisen's co-anchor on CNBC's ''Power Lunch''.

As previously mentioned, on March 12, 2018, [[Bill Griffeth]], formerly co-anchor of CNBC's ''[[Closing Bell]]'', joined ''NBR'' to replace Tyler Mathiesen.  Griffeth is reunited with his former ''Power Lunch'' co-anchor, Sue Herera, on this program.

==Title cards and theme music==
The themes and bumper music that were used from January 22, 1979 to January 1, 1988 were composed by [[Edd Kalehoff]], also known for themes on other television series and game shows. The longest-running theme, also composed by Kalehoff, was used from January 4, 1988 to November 15, 2002. Along with an update to the graphics and presentation, the theme was updated on November 18, 2002 and was used until January 1, 2010. A new theme, logo, and set for the show's Miami headquarters debuted on January 4, 2010. This theme lasted until April 27, 2012. On April 30, 2012, a new virtual theme was introduced to the show with new graphics and music. On March 4, 2013, another new set of graphics was introduced, yet the theme music remained the same.  On January 4, 2016, the graphics were changed again; this time they are modeled after CNBC's current graphics package (which itself has been used since October 2014).

==Ratings==
Ratings continue to change, as the series airs every weeknight on public television's WORLD channel as well as on local public television stations' primary channels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24615">A '''patent box''' is a special tax regime used by several countries to incentivise research and development by taxing [[intellectual property|patent]] revenues differently from other commercial revenues. It is also known as '''intellectual property box regime''', innovation box or '''IP box'''.
{{TOC right|limit=3}}

==History==
In the early 1970s Ireland introduced the first scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinal-ip.com/ip-news-strategy/the-patent-box/|title=The Patent Box|publisher=Cardinal-ip.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Seán Lemass and after|Corporation Tax]]. Section 34 of the 1973 Finance Act allowed total tax relief in respect of royalties and other income from licenses patented in Ireland. 

The concept was applied in 2001 by the French Tax Authorities as a reduced rate of tax on revenue from IP licensing or the transfer of qualified IP.&lt;ref&gt;ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp13070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Within Europe, Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have also introduced similar schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neocleous.com/assets/modules/neo/publications/1592/docs/Global_Tax_Weekly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916035601/http://neocleous.com/assets/modules/neo/publications/1592/docs/Global_Tax_Weekly.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The Irish Patent Box system is one of the key benefits for companies paying Irish corporation tax. The system was criticised by [[Lionel Jospin]] in the early 2000s and more recently by both the EU (Ecofin assessment 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belastingrechtaandevu.nl/Portals/0/images/140702_Sheets_panel2.pdf|format=PDF|title=EU and OECD aspects of IP-regimes|publisher=Belastingrechtaandevu.nl|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the OECD under its [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) project.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/review-of-patent-tax-regimes-in-eu-has-irish-support-1.1905477|title=Review of patent tax regimes in EU has Irish support|work=Irish Times|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been key to attracting international IT companies to Ireland. The economic benefits of beneficial tax regimes for revenues from patents led to similar schemes being introduced in France in 2000 and amended in 2005 &amp; 2010.

==Schemes by country==

===Cyprus===
IP box rules were changed in October 2016, valid since July 2016 - reduced the list of the qualified IP incomes, no patents nor trademarks anymore. 80% of income is exempted after deducting the real expenses, giving an effective tax rate of 2.5% or less.

===Ireland===
{{main article|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland}}
The scheme which had existed since 1973 was withdrawn in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2012/02/16/00064.asp|title=Dáil Éireann - 16/Feb/2012 Written Answers - Tax Code|publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/press/budget/archive/2011/budget-2011-summary.pdf|format=PDF|title=BUDGET SUMMARY 2011 |publisher=Revenue.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the National recovery Plan 2011-2015 of the Republic of Ireland. It exempted revenue from qualifying Patents from Irish corporation tax. The exemption is to be replaced by a “[[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Knowledge development box|Knowledge Development Box]]” in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/budget-2015-new-knowledge-box-tax-incentive-scheme-to-be-targeted-in-eu-probe-30671379.html|title=Budget 2015: New 'knowledge box' tax incentive scheme to be targeted in EU probe|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-15/goodbye-double-irish-hello-knowledge-box|title=Goodbye Double Irish, Hello Knowledge Box|author=Leonid Bershidsky|work=BloombergView.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering a reduced tax rate of 6.25% on qualifying profits generated in periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.

The key difference in the Irish KDB to those of other European countries is its compliance with the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Knowledge Box will help increase investment into Ireland – Budget Statement|url = http://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/budget-statement/|website = www.idaireland.com|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; programme, Ireland’s is the first patent-box type system to offer compliance in this area. Companies availing of the current R&amp;D tax credit should be aware of the KDB and the potential for them to take advantage of both systems.

===France===
Introduced in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Code général des impôts Légifrance&lt;/ref&gt; the Patents and royalties regime allows companies paying French corporation tax to pay a reduced rate of 15% (instead of 33%) on patent and royalties income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifiscal.fr/fiche-pratique/imposition-benefices/calcul-resultat-fiscal.html|title=Calcul résultat fiscal impot société is LégiFiscal|publisher=Legifiscal.fr|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are treated as a long term capital gain. If the licensee is a French corporation and actually uses the qualified IP licensed, the licensee may deduct the royalty payments from its income taxable at the standard 33.33% rate even if the licensor is taxed at the reduced 15% rate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jetro.go.jp/world/europe/ip/pdf/european_patent_box_regimes_en.pdf|title=European patent box regimes|publisher=Japan External Trade Organisation|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226033009/http://www.jetro.go.jp/world/europe/ip/pdf/european_patent_box_regimes_en.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands introduced a patent box tax regime referred to as the ‘innovation box’ in January 2007. This initial regime applied only to patents and applied a 10% rate of corporate tax. On 1 January 2010 the regime was expanded to include a much wider range of IP and the headline rate was reduced to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovativetax.com/news/dutch-ip-innovation-box-effective-tax-rate-of-5-on-r-d-activities.html|title=Dutch IP Innovation Box: effective tax rate of 5% on R &amp; D activities|publisher=Innovativetax.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced rate of corporate tax applies to the net positive income derived from the qualifying IP ( gross income minus all related expenses and depreciation).

===Belgium ===
The patent box scheme in Belgium was introduced in January 2007, and is known as a patent income deduction (PID). The last revision applies from July 2016. This PID allows a company, liable to pay Corporation Tax in Belgium, to deduct from its taxable income 85% of gross patent income. The remaining 15% of gross patent income is taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 34% (including a 3% surtax). This results in an effective tax rate of 5.1% on the qualifying income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/checkpoint/belgium-enacts-patent-box-incentive-regime/|title=Belgium Enacts Patent Box Incentive Regime|date=2017-02-28|work=Thomson Reuters Tax &amp; Accounting|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxembourg===
The Luxembourg IP regime has been abolished. IP regimes claimed before July 2016 can still continue to benefit from the preferential rate for the next 5 years. It is expected that Luxembourg creates a new IP regime following the OECD criteria.

In Luxembourg IP regime became effective in January 2008 and amended in 2008 to also exclude qualifying IP assets from Luxembourg’s net wealth tax. The scheme applies to the net income derived from the use of qualifying intellectual property acquired or developed after December 2007. 80% of income is exempted, giving an effective tax rate of 5.76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/invest-luxembourg/intellectual-property/index.html|title=Intellectual Property|publisher=Luxembourg.public.lu|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018225721/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/invest-luxembourg/intellectual-property/index.html|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Hungary introduced a scheme in 2003 including a provision according to which 50% of the pre-tax amount of the royalties received may be deducted from the tax base, this reducing the effective corporate tax rate on such royalties from 9% to 4.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itpa.org/?p=6640|title=The International Tax Planning Association Library – Hungary's New Position in the Royalty Planning Industry by Dr Willem G.

===Spain===
As of January 1, 2008, 50% of the gross income of Spanish domiciled companies derived from qualified Intellectual Property is exempt from Spain’s Corporation tax resulting in an effective tax rate of 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/washington-national-tax/assets/Merrill0326.pdf|format=PDF|title=Is It Time for the United States to Consider the Patent Box?|publisher=Pwc.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom introduced a Patent Box scheme in 2013 taxing qualifying IP at 10%.
The Patent Box in the UK is a tax incentive introduced in 2013 designed to encourage companies to make profits from their patents by reducing the UK tax paid on those profits.

====History====
The UK Patent Box went live in April 2013. The [[UK]] government wants to encourage high-value growth in [[Economy of the United Kingdom|UK plc]] through a competitive tax regime that supports UK [[R&amp;D]] from conception to commercialisation. The Patent Box forms a key part of this strategy by encouraging companies to ''commercialise'' their [[patents]] and R&amp;D in the UK. Other countries (eg.Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands) already operate schemes to provide incentives for companies to retain and commercialise existing patents

The scheme was first proposed in the 2009 Pre-Budget Report and went through various iterations and public consultations until final legislation was passed in the [[Finance Act]] 2012. The legislation is now formally a new Part 8A of the [[Corporation Tax Act 2010]] entitled "Profits Arising from the Exploitation of Patents etc". The Finance (No.2 Bill) 2015/16 includes proposed amendments, which, if implemented, will amend the patent box rules.

The Patent Box initiative is complementary to the R&amp;D tax incentives which encourage companies to ''undertake'' their R&amp;D in the UKhb

The Patent Box allows a 10% tax rate on [[profit (accounting)|profits]] derived from any products that incorporate patents. The net benefit for claiming companies is likely to be several percentage points of their corporate earnings, given that the main rate of [[UK corporation tax]] is 20 per cent.

The steady state cost, after the initial phasing- in period, of the Patent Box is forecast to be approximately £1.1 billion in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by HM Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Budget 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim process is as follows:
*calculate qualifying income by identifying revenue streams from qualifying patents, 
*calculate the profit generated from this qualifying income, 
*then calculate residual profit by deducting routine profit made from routine business activities,
*then calculate the Patent box profit by deducting any profits derived from branding or marketing attributes
* then use the [[HMRC]] formula to calculate the corporate tax deduction.

====How to claim====
Companies must calculate their qualifying Patent Box profit and then apply a specific formula in their tax computation to calculate the deduction in their tax liability. Then they can take the tax deduction as a benefit in their CT600 tax return.
The formula to calculate the amount of the tax deduction is

 &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P} \mathbf{B} *\left ( \frac {MR-PBR} {MR} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*PB is the Patent Box profit for the company,
*MR is the main rate of corporation tax, and 
*PBR is the special Patent Box tax rate (10 per cent)

====Qualifying patents====
Qualifying patents must have been granted by an approved patent-granting body, including the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]], the [[European Patent Office]], and designated European territories:&lt;ref&gt;HMRC,[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD210160.htm "CIRD Patent Box manual"] Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Statutory Instrument 2013 No. 420 The Profits from Patents (EEA Rights) Order 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria; Bulgaria; the Czech republic; Denmark; Estonia; Finland; Germany; Hungary; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia and Sweden.

Currently, the Patent Box excludes patents registered in territories such as the USA, France, and Spain because of differences in the search and approval process for patent applications.

The Patent Box excludes products that only have [[copyright]] or [[trademark]] protection.

====Qualifying income====
There are five categories (“heads”) of qualifying income: 
*'''head 1''': worldwide income from the sale of products incorporating at least one embedded patent (and including income from sale of integral spare parts)
*'''head 2''': licence fees or [[royalties]] from qualifying [[Intellectual Property|IP]]
*'''head 3''': sale or disposal of qualifying IP and rights over qualifying IP 
*'''heads 4 &amp; 5''': damages/compensation income from infringement/loss of sales of qualifying IP rights

Income generated from exclusive licenses will be qualifying income on both sides of the agreement – i.e. for the licensor ''and'' the licensee – subject to specific conditions concerning the meaning of exclusivity.

“IP-derived income”, where patented products or processes are used in the manufacture or delivery of non-patented products or services, will be qualifying income to the extent of a notional royalty which values the specific patented product or process as a proportion of the value of the non-patented product or service.

====Qualifying company====
*must hold qualifying IP rights
*must elect into the scheme
*must fulfill “development” and/or “active ownership” conditions

====Details in the legislation to look out for====
*notional [[royalties|royalty]] 
*notional [[marketing]] royalty and marketing intangibles (including [[transfer pricing]])
*streaming
*meaning of exclusivity
*R&amp;D shortfall

====Anti-avoidance====
The following situations will be against the law:
*where a functionally irrelevant patent is incorporated into a product with the sole purpose of achieving Patent Box eligibility 
*commercially irrelevant grant of exclusivity with the sole purpose of achieving Patent Box eligibility 
*any scheme designed to inflate artificially qualifying IP income or qualifying Patent Box profits.
Reasonable and commercially appropriate steps to restructure corporate arrangements to take advantage of the Patent Box will be considered legitimate.

====Other technology tax reliefs====
*[[Research and Development Tax Credit]]
*[[Research and Development Expenditure Credit]]
*Above the Line R&amp;D Tax Relief
*[[Research and Development Capital Allowances]] 
*[[Creative Sector Tax Relief]]s including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-end TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief

The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

====Government working group====
The government established a working group to complement wider consultation on the Patent Box and to discuss options and proposals in more detail. Members of the Working Group include representatives from: [[HMRC]] and [[HM Treasury]]; industry ([[GlaxoSmithKline]]; [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]]; [[ARM Holdings|ARM]]'''[[Syngenta]]), the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]; [[KPMG]]; [[Ernst and Young]]); independent consultants and representatives from the technology commercialisation sphere and professional bodies.

====OECD Forum for Harmful Tax Practices and the EU Code of Conduct Group====
The UK government is in the process of gathering evidence to submit to the [[Forum for Harmful Tax Practices]] (FHTP), part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), in the forum's work on international base erosion and profit shifting, specifically Action Point 5 of the OECD Action Plan published in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Publishing, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264202719-en: "OECD (2013), Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting."] Retrieved 09 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The forum provides member countries with the opportunity to review each other’s tax arrangements and to challenge harmful tax initiatives.

Action 5 focuses on “substantial activity” that must occur in a jurisdiction for a company to benefit from a specific preferential tax regime.

The UK government publicly supports the current work around Action 5 to ensure a better understanding of what constitutes economic substance when businesses carry out R&amp;D activities, so as to effectively address those instances where preferential tax regimes might present an opportunity to shift profits.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury March 2014, [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-aggressive-tax-planning-in-the-global-economy-uk-priorities-for-the-g20-oecd-project-for-countering-base-erosion-and-profit-shifting  "Tackling aggressive tax planning in the global economy: UK priorities for the G20-OECD project for countering Base Erosion and Profit Shifting."] Retrieved 09 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Options being discussed include a new method of calculating benefits for IP-incentive tax schemes.  This is the so-called nexus approach (where underlying expenditure to create the IP is used to define the proportion of qualifying income generated from the IP), rather than the conventional transfer pricing approach (where transfer pricing principles define a substantial activity test and either the IP commercialisation activity passes the test or it does not, and all IP income thus either qualifies or it does not).

These discussions are also informed by work being carried out by the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]] (ECOFIN) and the EU Code of Conduct Group, which started in 2013 to look at the workings of the UK Patent Box scheme. The Code of Conduct Group operates on a similar basis to the FHTP. The Code of Conduct Group partnered with the FHTP in these discussions in early 2014.

====Anglo-German accord on the UK Patent Box====
Following a sustained period of international tax scrutiny led by Germany in the FHTP and the EU Code of Conduct Group, a compromise agreement for the UK patent box scheme based on a modified nexus approach was announced by the UK and Germany on 11 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government November 2014, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/373135/GERMANY_UK_STATEMENT.pdf  "Proposals for New Rules for Preferential IP Regimes"] Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of a nexus based approach will have significant implications for the UK patent box scheme; fundamentally, patent box relief will now be restricted to profits generated from IP initially developed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmp-tax.co.uk/pdfs/A_fresh_start_for_UK_patent_box_28112014.pdf|title= A fresh start for the UK's patent box scheme.|journal=LexisNexis PSL tax|date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main points in the Anglo-German accord have been announced as follows:
*a 30% uplift will be allowed to increase the value of the eligible R&amp;D expenditure proxy for outsourcing or acquisition costs 
*the existing UK regime will be closed to new entrants (for both products and patents) in June 2016 (and the existing scheme will be abolished in full by June 2021)
*IP within the existing regime will be able to retain the benefits of the scheme until June 2021, to allow time for transition to the new nexus regime 
*a practical and proportionate tracking and tracing approach will be introduced that can be implemented by companies and tax authorities with practical methodologies that companies and tax authorities can adopt to map R&amp;D expenditure to IP creation. 
The UK and Germany submitted their proposal to the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices during its meeting on 17–19 November, and they have also committed to seek formal approval from the OECD and [[G20]] at the January 2015 meeting of the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs.

===Switzerland===

====Mixed-company====
Switzerland allows companies who predominantly trade internationally to benefit from the advantageous “mixed-company” status that allows them to be taxed at a rate of just 8,5%. In 2007 the European Commission alleged the tax schemes for holding, mixed and domiciliary companies violated the 1972 [[Free Trade Agreement|FTA]]    between the EU and Switzerland as it was State Aid. Although the Swiss government refuted the allegation in May 2012 the Swiss cantons gave the federal government the go-ahead to commence a tax dialogue with the EU. In May 2014 the EU and Switzerland reached an agreement whereby the disputed tax regimes would be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/themen/internationale-steuerpolitik/unternehmensbesteuerung/eu-unternehmenssteuerdialog.html|title=Dialogue with the EU|author=[[State Secretariat for International Financial Matters]]|publisher=Sif.admin.ch|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024161128/https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/themen/internationale-steuerpolitik/unternehmensbesteuerung/eu-unternehmenssteuerdialog.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}
'''Paul Fentener van Vlissingen''' (21 March 1941 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] – 21 August 2006 in [[Langbroek]]) was a Dutch-British businessman and philanthropist. Ranked as the richest man in Scotland in 2005, he contributed to the development of game reserves in Africa and bought [[Letterewe]] estate in Scotland, where he pledged the [[right to roam]], years ahead of the rest of the country.

==Early life==
Paul Fentener van Vlissingen was the youngest son of Frits Fentener van Vlissingen II, one of the leading Dutch industrialist families whose fortune was based on shipping coal on the Rhine in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article616448.ece| title=Obituary: Paul van Vlissingen|work=The Times |location=UK| date=23 August 2006| accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frits III, his eldest brother, died in March 2006. [[John Fentener van Vlissingen|John]], the middle brother, is the last alive. Paul inherited a significant shareholding in the company [[SHV Holdings]] from his father, Frits II, whose own father had co-founded the business through a merger with eight other Dutch trading families in 1896. Paul's father, described as one of the "fathers of the Dutch economy", later bought out most of the other families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/SHV-Holdings-NV-Company-History.html| title=SHV Holdings N.V.| publisher=Funding Universe| accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SHV Holdings ==
Paul Fentener van Vlissingen studied economics at the [[University of Groningen]] before joining [[SHV Holdings|SHV]]. Originally Europe's largest coal wholesaling business, SHV is the largest privately owned company in the [[Netherlands]]. In May 1974, he joined the SHV board, and succeeded his brother, Frits, as chairman in 1980.

Paul led SHV as chief executive officer for three decades from the mid-1960s. Under his leadership, the company diversified into new areas ahead of the collapse of the coal market in the 1960s. The areas he became involved with included retail – through the [[Makro]] and Otto Reichelt chains of grocery supermarkets and cash &amp; carries – and energy – through the acquisitions of LPG companies including [[Calor Gas]] in the UK and Primagaz in France. He also diversified into scrap metal, recycling, oil exploration, renewable energy and private equity. In 1995 he stepped down and then served as non-executive chairman.

Fentener van Vlissingen had a maverick leadership style and was more philosophical than most business leaders. For example, he recognised the possibility of the existence of [[global warming]] as early as the early 1990s and had a love for cryptic aphorisms. He allowed young managers whom he trusted to establish Makro operations in overseas markets, giving them unusual amounts of autonomy.

== Philanthropy and conservation ==
Fentener Van Vlissingen was recognised as an enlightened conservationist and contributed to the development of game reserves in [[Scotland]], South Africa, [[Malawi]], Zambia and [[Ethiopia]]. In 1978 he bought the wild and roadless {{convert|85000|acre|km2|-1}} [[Letterewe]] estate in [[Wester Ross]], and in 2006 was described as the largest foreign landowner in Scotland. "I don't call myself the owner," he said of Letterewe. "You can't own a place like this. It belongs to the planet. I'm only the guardian of it."

An obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'' said that van Vlissingen sometimes saddled a pony with a week's provisions and disappeared into the hills, staying at a bothy without lights or a toilet.&lt;ref name="inde"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/paul-van-vlissingen-413408.html| title=Paul Van Vlissingen|work=The Independent |location=UK| date=26 August 2006| accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obituary said: "He was in the habit of inviting everyone, whether landowners, journalists, birdwatchers or ramblers, to visit the estate and talk about issues face to face."&lt;ref name="inde"/&gt;

He also proposed reintroducing [[gray wolf|wolves]] and [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] to this estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=117&amp;id=692962002| title=Wildlife scheme to lure tourists| author=John Ross|work=The Scotsman |location=UK| accessdate=17 October 2009| date=26 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Letterewe Accord, an agreement that gave ramblers freedom of access to the entire Letterewe estate in exchange for a pledge to respect the land, predated the Scottish Parliament's own [[right to roam|right-to-roam]] legislation by over a decade. Van Vlissingen was also a great supporter of [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], and donated [[pound sterling|£]]250,000 to [[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]], a Gaelic college on [[Skye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5259420.stm| title=Billionaire's Gaelic studies gift|publisher=BBC News  | date=17 August 2006| accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 until his death, his home was the [[Conholt|Conholt Park]] estate in Wiltshire, England, on the border with Hampshire. Here too he applied sustainable land management and nature conservation.&lt;ref name="inde" /&gt;

The [[Sunday Times Rich List 2005]] ranked Van Vlissingen as the richest man in Scotland, with an estimated wealth of £1.1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]].

After a near fatal brush with [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] in 1980, he founded the '''Van Vlissingen Cancer Fund''', which is now one of the major cancer fundraisers in the Netherlands.

== ''Entrepreneurs are Jackasses'' ==
In 2001 he wrote a book entitled ''Ondernemers zijn ezels'' ({{ISBN|90-5018-295-X}}), which can be translated as ''Entrepreneurs are Jackasses''. In this book he discussed his experiences directing a large multi-national conglomerate. He followed this up in 2002 with a book entitled ''Overstekende ezels'' ({{ISBN|90-5018-583-5}}), translated as ''Crossing Jackasses''. In this he discusses his views regarding entrepreneurs, [[Corporate crime|corruption]], ambition, the euro, money, [[honesty]], [[:wikt:change|change]] and [[wikt:success|success]].

== Deathbed warning for the planet ==
In April 2006, van Vlissingen announced that he had terminal pancreatic cancer and that he would not be having chemotherapy. He said: "In the Western world we mistakenly try to keep death at bay. I look to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] instead. When they see their death approaching, they visit good friends and family to share happy memories and look back at the good things."

In an interview with the Dutch newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' published in April 2006, he said: "Our planet is in a much sorrier state than it was when I was a child. The destruction cannot go on at this pace. My generation should be ashamed of the condition in which we are passing on our planet to future generations."

In August 2006, the cancer got worse, and this led to his death during the night of the 20–21 August 2006. The information of his death was released to the public on 22 August. Many broadcasters stated (wrongly) that Fentener van Vlissingen was the middle of the three Van Vlissingen brothers. In fact, Paul was the youngest.

== Unorthodox to the last ==
In February 2006 it emerged that in his will Fentener van Vlissingen left a significant portion of his estate to his partner, the former [[The Guardian|Guardian]] art critic Caroline Tisdall, as well as several million to his lover Suzanne Wolff. ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Tisdall had been prepared to tolerate the billionaire's relationship with Wolff in his latter years. He left the bulk of his fortune and the [[Letterewe|Letterewe Estate]] in north-west Scotland to his two daughters, Alicia and Tet and to their children. According to the ''Daily Mail'', nothing was left to his ex-wife and the mother of Alicia and Tet, Ank Van Vlissingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-438781/To-lovers-happily-shared-I-leave-4m-To-mother-children--nothing.html |title=To the lovers who happily shared me, I leave £4m.

The '''RMIT School of Accounting''' is an [[Australia]]n university [[business school]] located in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], which is responsible for [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]] and [[research]] in [[accounting]] at [[RMIT University]]. The School was established in 1943 and its name was changed to the School of Accountancy (later Accounting) in 1948.

== History ==
The first [[accounting|accountancy]] classes at RMIT were taught by A. G. Robinson, an accountant in private practice, who had conducted evening classes at his offices since the early 1930s to prepare students for the examinations of the various [[Accounting networks and associations|accountancy institutes]] of the time (predecessors to the Australian Society of Accountants; now [[CPA Australia]]).&lt;ref name="p221Murray-Smith&amp;Dare"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray-Smith|Dare|1987|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Robinson approached the President of the Melbourne Technical College (as RMIT was then known), Frank Ellis, to transfer his existing classes to the College.&lt;ref name="p221Murray-Smith&amp;Dare" /&gt; Robinson began teaching classes at the College in March 1935 and by the end of 1936 had graduated over 40 qualified accountants.&lt;ref name="p221Murray-Smith&amp;Dare" /&gt;
 
Following an objection to this arrangement by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[Department of Education and Training (Victoria)|Department of Education]] in 1941, E. J. Edwards was then placed in charge of teaching accountancy at the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray-Smith|Dare|1987|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwards established a Department of Commerce in 1943, which was advertising classes in [[Management|managerial]] and [[industrial management|industrial organisation]] and accountancy by September that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Advertising |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/206363500 |work=[[The Age]] |date=September 7, 1943 |page=6 |via=[[National Library of Australia]] |access-date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year [[diploma]] course in accountancy was developed in 1944, which admitted graduates to the [[Commonwealth Institute of Accountants]], and was administered by the College and the Institute.&lt;ref name="p307MurraySmith&amp;Dare" /&gt; The Department's name was changed to the School of Accountancy in 1948 due to the majority of it studies being in that field.&lt;ref name="p307MurraySmith&amp;Dare"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray-Smith|Dare|1987|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the Department grew rapidly and, by 1948, had an enrolment of 1525 students in its accountancy diploma as well as its preparatory classes for the examinations of the Bankers' Institute of Australasia, [[Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators|Chartered Institute of Secretaries]], Companies Auditors' Board and Municipal Auditors' Board.&lt;ref name="p307MurraySmith&amp;Dare" /&gt; In 1952, the various accountancy institutes of the time, including the Commonwealth Institute of Accountants, amalgamated to form the Australian Society of Accountants and introduced a new joint examiner's board at the School which later served as a model for other schools in Victoria as well as other states of Australia.&lt;ref name="p308Murray-Smith&amp;Dare"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray-Smith|Dare|1987|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the School was approached by the Real Estate and Stock Institute of Victoria (now REIV) to develop a [[Professional certification|certificate]] course in [[property management|real estate management]] and [[Real estate appraisal|valuation]] and, by 1954, nearly all training for land valuers in Victoria was being conducted by the School.&lt;ref name="p308Murray-Smith&amp;Dare" /&gt; In 1954, the School was approached by the [[Institute of Public Administration Australia|Institute of Public Administration]] to develop a certificate course in [[public administration]] which was later expanded to a diploma in 1956.&lt;ref name="p308Murray-Smith&amp;Dare" /&gt; Both of these courses would later break away from the School of Accounting to form the predecessors to RMIT's [[RMIT School of Global, Urban and Social Studies|School of Global, Urban and Social Studies]] and [[RMIT School of Property, Construction and Project Management|School of Property, Construction and Project Management]].

== Courses and programs ==
RMIT began to accredit its own courses in the School of Accounting after the Australian Society of Accountants abandoned its policy of staged examination, in favour of admitting graduates from appropriate degrees and diplomas, in the 1960s—like other professional societies of the time in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, B. E. (1968). ''The Education of Professional Engineers in Australia''. Melbourne: Association of Professional Engineers, Australia, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; 

The School offers [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]] courses in accounting and [[financial services]] programs and a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] in accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/academic-schools/accounting/our-teaching-areas Teaching areas—School of Accounting]. [[RMIT University]]. Retrieved May 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the School was ranked among the top 100 in the world for accounting and finance subjects in the [[QS World University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/documents/about/annual-reports/RMIT%20Annual%20Report%202016%20FINAL.pdf 2016 Annual Report], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
The School of Accounting hosts two annual [[Academic conference|conferences]]: the RMIT Accounting for Sustainability Conference in May and RMIT Accounting Educators Conference in November.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/academic-schools/accounting/research Research—School of Accounting].

The '''Shareholder Executive''' ('''ShEx''') was a body within the [[UK Government]] responsible for managing the government's financial interest in a range of [[government-owned corporation|state-owned businesses]] for commercial rather than political interests. It was part of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and staffed by civil servants, many of whom were corporate finance professionals with private sector experience. It was led by [[Mark Francis Russell|Mark Russell]] as Chief Executive at the time of its closure.

== Role ==
The Shareholder Executive managed a portfolio of businesses with a combined turnover of around £12&amp;nbsp;billion. The businesses varied and could be in the form of a [[limited company]], [[public limited company]], [[limited liability partnership]], [[statutory corporation]], [[trading fund]], [[executive agency]], [[non-departmental public body]] or [[non-ministerial government department]]. 

It advised the government on drafting parts of the [[Postal Services Act 2011]] and worked on the [[privatisation]] of [[Royal Mail]] and the possible [[mutual organisation|mutualisation]] of [[Post Office Ltd]]. It was also involved in establishing the [[UK Green Investment Bank]], the [[Public Data Group]] and the [[British Business Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/shareholderexecutive/about-us |title=About us |publisher= Shareholder Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not responsible for the government's shares in UK banks, which were managed by [[UK Financial Investments]] (UKFI), or the government's property holdings, which were managed by the [[Government Property Unit]] (GPU).

== History ==
The Shareholder Executive was originally established in September 2003 as part of the [[Cabinet Office]]. In 2004 it moved to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI). 

In 2007 the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] published a report into the Shareholder Executive. This was broadly positive but had some misgivings about its location in the DTI.

Following the split of the DTI in 2007, ShEX moved to the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] (BERR) and then to its successor, the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS) in 2009.

The Shareholder Executive was originally involved in the government's [[nationalisation]] of [[Northern Rock]] and [[Bradford &amp; Bingley]] at the start of the banking crisis in 2008. It then began the process of splitting off Northern Rock's '[[bad bank]]' mortgage business to form [[Northern Rock (Asset Management)|Northern Rock]]. All bank shareholdings were transferred to [[UK Financial Investments]] in November 2008.

In 2011 the Government Property Unit was moved from the Shareholder Executive to the [[Cabinet Office]] as part of the new [[Efficiency and Reform Group]].

In 2015, the government announced that the Shareholder Executive would be transferred to [[HM Treasury]] and became subsidiary of [[UK Government Investments]], along with [[UK Financial Investments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/machinery-of-government-shareholder-executive-and-uk-financial-investments|title=Machinery of government: Shareholder Executive and UK Financial Investments – Press releases|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to occur with the end of the government fiscal year on 1 April 2016.

== Portfolio Unit ==
The Portfolio Unit contains businesses where the Shareholder Executive has a shareholding mandate, although the shares themselves are owned by government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/shareholderexecutive/structure/portfolio-unit |title=Portfolio Unit |publisher= Shareholder Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role is either accountable to ministers directly ('executive'), working alongside shareholding teams within departments ('joint team') or advising department shareholder teams ('advisory'). Most businesses are wholly owned by the government, but some are part owned.

'''Victor Leydet''' (1845-1908) was a French businessman, politician and novelist. He served as a member of the [[Senate of France]] from 1897 to 1908.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Victor Leydet was born on July 3, 1845 in [[Aix-en-Provence]].&lt;ref name="senat"&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/senateur-3eme-republique/leydet_victor0316r3.html Senate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"&gt;[http://ruesdaix.ag13.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/LEYDET.html Les Rues d'Aix]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Joseph Vincent Leydet, was a factory worker.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; His mother was Marie Françoise Laurin.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He was educated at the Collège Mignet (then known as the Collège Bourbon) in Aix.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Business career===
He started his career as a shop assistant in shops in Aix.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; Later, he became Director of one of the biggest [[olive oil]] factories in [[Provence]].&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;

===Political career===
A staunch supporter of the Republic, he joined the [[Radical Left (France)|Radical Left]], a left-wing political party.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo A. Loubere, ''Radicalism in Mediterranean France'', Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1974, p. 165 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TFwRZ1BRnUC&amp;pg=PA165]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the town council of Aix in 1870.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He also served as Deputy-Mayor of Aix from 1876 to 1882, when [[Salomon Bédarrides]] (1809-1886)  was the Mayor.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He also joined the General Council of the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] (representing [[Peyrolles-en-Provence|Peyrolles]]), when he campaigned for match-making factories to be returned to the French homeland rather than in her colonies; they were returned to France in 1872, and a new match-making factory was built in Aix from 1892 to 1895 (now reconverted as the [[Bibliothèque Méjanes]], a public library, since 1989).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He also worked as a judge in the Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;

He served as a French Senator from 1897 to his death in 1908.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He was opposed to the policies of [[Léon Gambetta]] (1838-1882) and [[Jules Ferry]] (1832-1892), and he voted against extending the [[Tonkin Campaign]] in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; Additionally, he voted in favour of the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He proposed a law to establish an income tax which would be progressive and proportional.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He supported a break-up of the match-making industry in France, a French state monopoly which lasted from 1872 to 1992 (initially established to finance the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-1871).&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; In his second tenure, which started in 1903, he opposed the policies of [[Maurice Rouvier]] (1842–1911) [[Pierre Tirard]] (1827-1893) &lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He was also in favour of going after General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]] (1837–1891), who attempted a coup d'état in 1889.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He took a look at regulating the use of the [[Durance]], protecting wild birds, increasing the number of fields of olive trees and tobacco in Provence, and promoting the [[Étang de Berre]].&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; Moreover, he was in favour of encouraging army recruitment, increasing railway tracks in France, and maintaining the [[Aix-Marseille University|University of Aix]] in Aix.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Novelist===
He wrote three novels set in Aix, published weekly in the newspaper ''Le National''.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Personal life===
He married Louise Ely.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; They had five sons and two daughters:
*[[Edmond Leydet]] (1869-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He was a Prefect of [[Eure-et-Loir]].&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Fernand Leydet (1871-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*[[Louis Leydet]] (1873-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He was a painter.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Lucien Marc Leydet (1874-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Paul Gabriel Leydet (1876-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Francia Leydet (1877-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Sextia Leydet (1883-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

His son Louis was friends with painter [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839-1906).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; As a result, Victor Leydet attended Cézanne's funeral and said a few words about him.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

He died on October 22, 1908 in Paris.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; His corpse was returned to Aix, and he was buried in the [[Saint-Pierre Cemetery (Aix-en-Provence)|Saint-Pierre Cemetery]] in Aix.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Legacy===
*The ''Rue Victor Leydet'' in Aix-en-Provence is named in his honour.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=np&amp;q=rue+victor+leydet+aix&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x12c98d980aca038f:0xec774dd312733788,Rue+Victor+Leydet,+13100+Aix-en-Provence,+France&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=Q-69Ut-vAsOBhAeW9IDYCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; He resided at number 40 on this street, formerly known as the ''Rue Villeverte''.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; On February 23, 1911, the town council decided to rename the street after him.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*On December 18, 1910, a [[bronze]] bust designed by sculptor [[Auguste Carli]] (1868-1930) was dedicated on the ''Place Jeanne d'Arc'' in Aix.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; Several ministers were present alongside a crowd of about 700.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; However, the bust was stolen by the Germans in 1943, during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; A new bust, made of [[plaster]] and initially on his cemetery tomb, is now in its place, behind a newsagent.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

He was arrested again from November 1971 to July 1972 for his connection with Burmese expatriates and foreign firms, and action was taken against him the third time in January 1975 for participation in what has come to be known as the ''[[U Thant]] crisis'', student-led protests over the shabby treatment by the [[Ne Win]] government of the remains of U Thant which were crushed by the military government, when he was given a 10-year prison term. He was freed in July 1980 under the Government's Amnesty Order No. 2180. He was detained in June 1986, accused of involvement in illegal dollar transaction, but was freed two weeks later under a personal surety.&lt;ref name="72.14.253.104"&gt;[http://www.myanmar-information.net/bcp/doc/THE%20CONSPIRACY%20OF%20TREASONOUS%20MINIONS%20WITHIN%20THE%20MYANMAR%20AND%20TRAITOROUS%20COHORTS%20ABROAD.doc The Conspiracy of Treasonous Minions within the Myanmar and Traitorous Cohorts Abroad] from PDF via Google&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a pioneer in bringing digital switching [[telephone exchange]]s to Burma, and has amassed a vast experience with the [[Economy of Burma|country's economic system]]. A business consultant to many international companies, he is now Chairman of Maw Htoon and Partners Co., Ltd., Shambhala Tours Co., Ltd., Shambhala Financial Services and the Myanmar Thai Gypsum Co., Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salonefestival.com/aboutus.htm |title=About Shambhala Company Limited |publisher=Salonefestival.com |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a lengthy press conference&lt;ref name="72.14.253.104"/&gt; on 9 September 1989, [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] First Secretary [[Brigadier General]] [[Khin Nyunt]] stated, "Fifty-two persons including Ye Htoon, who were in charge of the ''underground youth organization'' and who were trying to cause unrest in the country, were interrogated, and consequently documentary and other evidence (was) seized... We received information that a person called Ye Htoon, resident at 5/A Po Sein Road, [[Bahann]] Township, had been in contact with an organization called 'Da Nya Ta' ([[Alliance for Democratic Solidarity, Union of Burma]]) led by [[Thanmani Bo Khin Maung]], and was aiding and abetting that group's work from [[Yangon]] since. Information was also received that he had formed the underground youth organization called FFB ([[National Freedom Fighters of Burma]]) and was striving to cause unrest in the country under his supervision; the [[National Intelligence Bureau]] called in and interrogated 52 persons including Ye Htoon beginning 31 July 1989."

Ye Htoon was picked up, had his teeth kicked out and was sentenced to 19 years hard-labor rigorous imprisonment, for participating in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 democratic uprising]]. The specific crime, according to the [[Tatmadaw|junta]], was that he had met [[Bertil Lintner]] and provided him with information. He is also accused of being a [[ghostwriter]] for ''Outrage'', a book authored by Lintner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/database/2001/vol9.7/journal.html |title=Journalists Beware Vol 9.

Ye Htoon, as the leader of the [[Myanmar Mingala Foundation]], appears to be making preparations for the [[2010 Burmese elections]] before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burmadigest.info/2009/01/26/preparations-in-burma-for-2010-elections/ |title=Preparations in Burma for 2010 elections |publisher=Burmadigest.info |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
