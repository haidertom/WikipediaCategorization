{{Wiktionary|abridgement}}
An '''abridgement''' (or '''abridgment''') is a condensing or reduction of a book or other creative work into a shorter form while maintaining the unity of the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abridgment|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abridgment|work=m-w.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The abridgement can be true to the original work in terms of mood and [[tone (literature)|tone]], capturing the parts the abridging author perceives to be most important; it could be a complete [[parody]] of the original; or it could fall anywhere in-between, either generally capturing the tone and message of the original author but falling short in some manner, or subtly twisting their words and message to favor a different interpretation or agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abridgement
 |title      = Abrigement
 |last       = Brians
 |first      = Paus
 |accessdate = Mar 9, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare/contrast with [[epitome]].

A written work may be abridged to make it more accessible to a wider audience; for example, to make an adaptation of it as an [[audio book]] or a [[television show]], to make a more convenient companion to an already established work, or to create a shorter reference version.

Unabridged is the opposite of abridged. A common example is an unabridged [[dictionary]].

==Abridgement for audio==
Abridgement is most often used to adapt a book or film into a narrated audio version. Because books written for adults are generally meant to be read silently to oneself (which is usually much faster than reading aloud), most books can take between 20 and 40 hours to read aloud.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Because many audio book listeners are looking to more quickly listen to the information in a book, and because of the high cost associated with recording and distributing 40 hours of audio, audio book versions of novels are often produced in an abridged version.

Some party, usually an editor for the book's publishing company, will go through the text of the book and remove elements, notations, references, narratives, and sometimes entire scenes from a book that could be considered superfluous to the actual story or focus of the book in order to make its audible reading time shorter. A fully abridged audio book can span as little as 4 hours for a book that would span 20 hours unabridged.

The easiest content of a fiction book to edit out is [[back story]] often provided for characters or story elements that help support the reality of the story for the reader, but do not provide any narrative to the story itself. For example, a passage such as "John sped away in his automobile, a red 1967 Mustang he'd purchased from a junkyard and spent most of his college years restoring with his father" could be abridged to "John sped away in his automobile, a red 1967 Mustang" or—if context permits—simply "John sped away."

In a [[nonfiction]] piece, the most commonly abridged details are references, charts, details, and facts that are used to support an author's claim. While it would be unprofessional or irresponsible to omit such details from a book, it is understandable for an audio book as it is assumed the listener wants to hear the author's opinion, and if he/she needs to check the details he/she may refer to the text.

Occasionally, an abridged audio book will be advertised as "Abridgement approved by the author," which would imply that the original work's author has reviewed the trimmed down version of his/her work and agrees that the intention or narrative of his story has not been lost, or that no vital information has been removed.

In many cases, an audio book for a popular title is available in both an abridged and unabridged version, though the abridged version often is released first and almost always costs significantly less than the unabridged version. Often, the two versions are produced independently of each other and may have different narrators. Unabridged versions of books are popular among those with poor eyesight or reading skills who wish to appreciate the entirety of the work, while the abridged version is more often preferred by those who just want to follow the story in a quick and entertaining way.

On the radio (for example, in British [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] programmes as [[Book of the Week]], [[Book at Bedtime]], and [[Go 4 It]] for children), books are almost always abridged. Because of this, if someone were trying to read along with the book, one would find it much harder than on an audio book.

==Abridgement for print==
A shortened form of literary work, in which the major themes of the original are kept. Books are abridged for faster and easier reading. The Signet Classics Abridged Works are notable examples of abridgment; the Signet Classics Bible, for example, is 40 percent shorter than the 850,000-word [[King James Version]]. Although well-known passages in abridged works are often left intact, editors may remove "repetition, rhetoric and redundancy" from a complete work.

Until roughly the mid-nineteenth century, the act of abridgment was widely regarded as [[Fair use]] and was among the most frequently abused loopholes in British and American copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patry|first=William F.|title=The fair use privilege in copyright law|year=1995|publisher=Bureau of National Affairs|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-87179-831-X|pages=6–20|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1870s international outcry from authors and publishers alike prompted legislatures to consider revisions to end this "very unreasonable" principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deazley|first=Ronan|title=The Statute of Anne and the Great Abridgement Swindle|journal=Houston Law Review|year=2010|volume=47|page=797|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/hulr47&amp;div=34&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While increasingly uncommon, some books are published as abridged versions of earlier books. This is most common in textbooks, usually lengthy works in complicated fields like [[engineering]] or [[medicine]]. Abridged versions of popular textbooks are published to be used as [[Study skills|study]] aids or to provide enough surface information for the reader to become familiar with the material but not have a full understanding of it or its full scope.

==Abridgement for television==
Very often plays, notably [[Shakespeare]]'s, have been heavily abridged for television, in order to fit them into ninety-minute or two-hour time slots. (The same is true of long classical ballets such as the two-and-a-half hour ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', which has almost never been performed complete on television). This was done more often in the past than it is now (e.g. ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' from the 1950s until about 1970). With the advent of such non-commercially sponsored PBS anthologies such as ''[[Great Performances]]'', ''[[Live from Lincoln Center]]'' and the ''[[BBC Television Shakespeare]]'' plays, there is now less pressure to cram a three-hour-plus play like ''[[Hamlet]]'' into a two-hour time slot.

==Abridged series==
An abridged series is a fan-made parody series using footage from the original series, filled with comedic dubbing and non-sequitur dialogue. It is called "Abridged" because episodes are not as long as the original episodes. Most of the abridged series that are created are based on [[anime]] and uploaded onto [[YouTube]], which sometimes results in their takedown due to copyright infringement claims. The first abridged series, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malcolm-collins/the-abridged-series-an-em_b_3789012.html|title=The Abridged Series: An Emergence of a New Genre|first=Malcolm|last=Collins|date=22 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by Martin Billany (better known by his screen name ''LittleKuriboh'') in 2006 and has since inspired multiple new ones. Famous examples include ''Team Four Star's [[Dragon Ball Z]] Abridged'', ''[[Naruto]] The Abridged Series'', and ''[[Sword Art Online]] Abridged''.

'''ARTEXPRESS''' is an [[art exhibition]] which is a showcase of [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] Visual Arts Examination artworks from across [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Whilst usually perceived as an exhibition of 'the best' artworks, this is not necessarily true as the chosen artworks are merely representative of the broad diversity of different artworks submitted for that year's HSC.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Although students are not so restricted in the works that are produced for the HSC,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} ARTEXPRESS works must have a "G" rating.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} ARTEXPRESS occurs annually in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], Sydney Olympic Park and ten other art galleries in New South Wales. The works selected for ArtExpress reflect trends in the galleries who select the works, therefore they may not represent the exemplar works from the Visual Arts Examination but needs of the gallery showing the work. Works selected may reflect trends in cost cutting, so  less complex works with fewer components and often less challenging ( or engaging ) works for the audience are given focus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3163">The '''Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships''' were established in 1993 and were offered annually to professional artists who had demonstrated a consistent commitment to their art practice. The Fellowships were an internationally renowned programme open to all artists; national and international. Located in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], England, the Fellowships were intended to give artists a period of time when they could reflect upon their practice and focus on the development of their work, responding to the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and its coastal location.&lt;ref&gt;The Berwick Gymnasium Fellowships: An Archival Record, ed. Judith King, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0955747816}})&lt;/ref&gt; The former military barracks, known as [[Berwick Barracks]], that housed the studios and gallery space used by artists were built in the early 18th century to the design of the architect [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berwick-upon-Tweed Barracks and Main Guard|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/berwick-upon-tweed-barracks-and-main-guard/|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barracks were among the first in England to be purpose built. The fellowships were jointly funded by [[English Heritage]] and [[Arts Council England]] until 2011. The fellowships came to an end in 2011 after English Heritage announced funding cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future of gym gallery in doubt|url=http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/local/all-news/future-of-gym-gallery-in-doubt-1-1706086|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=Berwick Advertiser|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4651">MS '''Egerton 1782''' is the index title of an early sixteenth-century Irish [[vellum]] manuscript housed in the [[Egerton Collection]] of the [[British Library]], London.

==Overview==

The compilation dates from ''c''. 1517 and is the work of several scribes of the [[Ó Maolconaire]] (anglicised: O'Mulconry), a learned family of lawyers and historians, known also for compiling MS [[23 N 10]] later in the century.

In spite of its relatively late date (compared to, for instance, the [[Book of Leinster]], [[Lebor na hUidre]] or the [[Yellow Book of Lecan]]), it is one of the most important documents for the study of [[early Irish literature]]. Some texts, such as ''Aislinge Oenguso'', are preserved nowhere else.

[[File:Ademollo-Teano.jpg|thumb|325px|The Handshake of [[Teano]]]]
'''Carlo Ademollo''' (9 October 1824, [[Florence]] - 15 July 1911, Florence) was an Italian painter, best known for his scenes from the [[Risorgimento]].

==Biography==
He was the grandson of the Milanese painter, [[Luigi Ademollo]]. In 1838, he enrolled at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]], where he studied with [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-ademollo_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Brief biography] @ Treccani.&lt;/ref&gt; He had his first exhibition in 1848, with scenes of contemporary customs. He came from a liberal family, many of whose members enlisted as volunteers in the [[First War of Italian Independence]] but, as a painter, he remained strictly traditional. He briefly took part in the "{{ill|Scuola di Staggia|it}}" (a group of landscape painters inspired by the [[Barbizon school]]) and frequented the [[Caffè Michelangiolo]], but never joined the [[Macchiaioli]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

Later, he moved away from landscapes and [[Genre art|genre]] scenes to depict episodes from the Risorgimento; including the breach of the [[Porta Pia]] during the [[Capture of Rome]], the "[[Teano#"Handshake of Teano"|Handshake of Teano]]", between [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], and the execution of [[Felice Orsini]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

During the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], he followed the army at his own expense and maintained an extensive correspondence with those involved, requesting details to help him create his paintings. He also participated in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], receiving the rank of [[Adjutant]] to the commander of the National Guard of Florence. Later, the King designated him the official painter of the Italian Army.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In 1869, he was named a corresponding professor at his alma mater, the Accademia.

Many of his letters and other personal items were donated to the "{{ill|Istituto per la storia del Risorgimento italiano|it}}" by his nephew Umberto. The Instituto also possesses one of Ademollo's last works; a posthumous portrait of {{ill|Adelaide Cairoli|it}}.

A '''Collage novel''' is a form of [[artist's book]] approaching closely (but preceding) the [[graphic novel]]. [[Image]]s are selected from other publications and [[collage]]d together following a [[theme (literary)|theme]] or [[narrative]] (not necessarily [[linear]]).

==Surrealism==
The [[Dada]]ist and [[Surrealist]] [[Max Ernst]] (1891-1976) is generally credited with inventing the collage novel, employing nineteenth-century engravings cut and pasted together to create new images. His works include ''Les Malheurs des immortels'' (1922), ''La Femme 100 Têtes'' (1929), ''Rêve d'une petite fille...'' (1930) and ''[[Une Semaine de Bonté]]'' (1933-1934).

The text for ''Les Malheurs des immortels'' was written by [[Paul Éluard]].

{{Right|[[File:Dottore4.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Il Dottore]]}}
Each character in '''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''' is distinctly different, and defined by their movement, actions, [[Commedia dell'Arte Masks|masks]], and costumes. These costumes show their social status and background.

'''[[Pantalone]]''' typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim – very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a [[codpiece]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lea, K. M. Italian popular comedy. A study in the Commedia dell’Arte, 1560–1620 with special reference to the English stage. 1934. Reprint. New York, Russell &amp; Russell Inc. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Grantham, Barry. Playing Commedia: A Training Guide to Commedia Techniques.

New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Il Dottore]]''' was dressed almost entirely in black – shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat – broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Il Capitano]]''' did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country.  Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Innamorati|The Lovers]]''' wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Pulcinella]]''' always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gordon, Mel. Lazzi: The Comedic Routines of the Commedia dell’Arte.

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 07.jpg|thumb|upright|Scaramouche]]
{{Right|[[File:André Derain - Arlequin et Pierrot.jpg|thumb|Harlequin in diamonds, and Pierrot in white]]}}
'''[[Harlequin|Harlequin's]]''' costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Brighella]]''' wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Coviello]]''' had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Mezzettino]]''' wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Zanni]]''' was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''[[Scapino]]''' wore outfits with white and green stripes, and his mask had a hooked nose and pointed beard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pierrot]]''' had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pedrolino|Pedrolino's]]''' costume was essentially like Pierrot's – white, big buttons, short hat, and white face – but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''{{ill|Peppe Nappa|it}}''' copied Pierrot's clothes, but wore them in blue instead of white.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Columbina|Columbina's]]''' costume reflected her current master's, but included an apron. She wore no mask, but instead a bonnet, and her skirts were of different colors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Scaramouche]]''' wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia]]''' wore a black hat and very thick glasses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Rosetta]]''' was Pulcinella's maid or wife, who wore a dress with patches, like the early Arrlechino.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Trivelino]]''' was a Zanni who dressed in the Arlecchino fashion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening''''' (1944) is a [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. A short, alternate title for the painting is '''''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee'''''. It was painted in 1944, while Dalí and his wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]], were living in America.&lt;ref name=fulcrum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulcrumgallery.com/Salvador-Dali/Dream-Caused-by-the-Flight-of-a-Bee-Around-a-Pomegranate-A-Second-Before-Awakening_24430.htm|title=Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate, A Second Before Awakening|publisher=Fulcrum Gallery|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

In this "hand-painted dream photograph", as Dalí generally called his paintings, there is a seascape of distant horizons and calm waters, perhaps [[Port Lligat]], amidst which Gala is the subject of the scene. Next to the naked body of the sleeping woman, which levitates above a flat rock that floats above the sea, Dalí depicts two suspended droplets of water and a [[pomegranate]], a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Peter|title=A Dictionary Of Christian Art (Oxford Paperback Reference)|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location="Pomegranate"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the pomegranate flies a bee, an insect that traditionally symbolizes the Virgin.&lt;ref name="World History Of Beekeeping"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Eva|title=The World History OF Beekeeping And Honey Hunting|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-92467-2|pages=600–610|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC&amp;pg=PA605&amp;dq=bee+christian+virginity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fMa5TdLvFtS_gQe63eET&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bee%20christian%20virginity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper left of the painting what seems to be a [[yelloweye rockfish]] bursts out of the pomegranate, and in turn spews out a tiger that then spews out another tiger and a rifle with a bayonet that is about to sting Gala in the arm. Above them is Dalí's first use of an elephant with long flamingo legs, found in his later compositions such as ''[[The Temptation of St. Anthony (Dalí)|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]''. The elephant carries on its back an obelisk, inspired by Bernini’s ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'' in Rome's Piazza [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahlberg|first=Kristina|title=Bernini's Little Chick|url=http://honorsaharchive.blogspot.com/2007/02/berninis-elephant-obelisk-pulcino-della.html|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thyssen&gt;{{cite web|last=Thyssen|first=Museo|title=Permanent Collection|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/352|work=Museo Thyssen Permanent Collection|publisher=Museo Thyssen|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and symbolism==

The bayonet, as a symbol of the [[Bee sting|stinging bee]], may represent the woman's abrupt awakening from her otherwise peaceful dream. This is  an example of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s influence on surrealist art and Dalí's attempts to explore the world of [[dream]]s in a dreamscape.&lt;ref name=fulcrum /&gt;

The elephant is a distorted version of the [[Piazza della Minerva]] sculpture ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] facing the church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=Leroy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBZbhP3rW-YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA44&amp;lpg=RA1-cioooo |title=Surrealism|year=2004|author=Cathrin Klingsöhr-Leroy|accessdate=2008-01-08 | isbn=978-3-8228-2215-9 | publisher=Taschen}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--publisher=TaschenISBN=3822822159--&gt; The smaller pomegranate floating between two droplets of water may symbolize Venus, especially because of the heart-shaped shadow it casts.&lt;ref name=Leroy /&gt; It may also be used as a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection.&lt;ref name=Paloma /&gt; This female symbolism may contrast with the phallic symbolism of the threatening creatures.&lt;ref name=Leroy /&gt;

It has also been suggested that the painting is "a surrealist interpretation of the [[Theory of Evolution]]."&lt;ref name=ijdb&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=47&amp;issue=7-8|title=Evolution &amp; Development|year=2003|author=Jaume Baguñà and Jordi García-Fernández|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology|accessdate=2012-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819224327/http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=47&amp;issue=7-8|archivedate=2012-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Dalí said this painting was intended "to express for the first time in images [[Freud]]'s discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up. Thus, as a bar might fall on the neck of a sleeping person, causing them to wake up and for a long dream to end with the guillotine blade falling on them, the noise of the bee here provokes the sensation of the sting which will awaken Gala."&lt;ref name=Paloma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_texto388.html|title=Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Waking up|author=Paloma Alarcó|publisher=Museo de Arte Thyssen-Bornemisza|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guillotine anecdote refers to a dream reported by [[Alfred Maury]] in ''[[Le sommeil et les rêves]]'' ("Sleep and Dreams") and related by Freud in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''.

[[Image:Bruegel, Pieter de Oude - De val van icarus - hi res.jpg|thumb|290px|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus|The Fall of Icarus]]'', now considered a copy of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]
'''Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting''' represents the 16th-century response to [[Italian Renaissance art]] in the [[Low Countries]]. These artists, who span from the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] at the start of the 16th century to the late [[Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrik Goltzius]] and [[Joachim Wtewael]] at the end, drew on both the recent innovations of Italian painting and the local traditions of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish artists]]. [[Antwerp]] was the most important artistic centre in the region. Many artists worked for European courts, including Bosch, whose fantastic painted images left a long legacy. [[Jan Mabuse]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Frans Floris]] were all instrumental in adopting Italian models and incorporating them into their own artistic language. [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], with Bosch the only artist from the period to remain widely familiar, may seem atypical, but in fact his many innovations drew on the fertile artistic scene in Antwerp.

Dutch and Flemish painters were also instrumental in establishing new subjects such as [[landscape painting]] and [[genre painting]]. [[Joachim Patinir]], for example, played an important role in developing [[landscape painting]], inventing the compositional type of the [[world landscape]], which was perfected by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] who, followed by [[Pieter Aertsen]], also helped popularise [[genre painting]]. From the mid-century [[Pieter Aertsen]], later followed by his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]], established a type of "monumental [[still life]]" featuring large spreads of food with genre figures, and in the background small religious of moral scenes. Like the world landscapes, these represented a typically "Mannerist inversion" of the normal decorum of the [[hierarchy of genres]], giving the "lower" subject matter more space than the "higher".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 409-412, 432-445&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anthonis Mor]] was the leading portraitist of the mid-century, in demand in courts all over Europe for his reliable portraits in a style that combined Netherlandish precision with the lessons of [[Titian]] and other Italian painters.

==Stylistic evolution==
[[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance]] influences begin to show on [[Early Netherlandish painting]] around 1500, but in many ways the older style was remarkably persistent. [[Antwerp Mannerism]] is a term for painters showing some Italian influence, but mainly continuing the style and subjects of the older masters.  [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is a highly individual artist, whose work is strange and full of seemingly irrational imagery, making it difficult to interpret.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of all it seems surprisingly modern, introducing a world of dreams that seems more related to [[Gothic art]] than the Italian Renaissance, although some Venetian prints of the same period show a comparable degree of fantasy. The [[Romanism (painting)|Romanists]] were the next phase of influence, adopting Italian styles in a far more thorough way.

After 1550 the Flemish and Dutch painters begin to show more interest in nature and beauty "in itself", leading to a style that incorporates Renaissance elements, but remains far from the elegant lightness of Italian Renaissance art,&lt;ref name="Heughebaert"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and directly leads to the themes of the great Flemish and Dutch [[Baroque]] painters: landscapes, still lifes and genre painting - scenes from everyday life.&lt;ref name="Janson"/&gt;

This evolution is seen in the works of [[Joachim Patinir]] and [[Pieter Aertsen]], but the true genius among these painters was [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], well known for his depictions of nature and everyday life, showing a preference for the natural condition of man, choosing to depict the peasant instead of the prince.

''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus|The Fall of Icarus]]'' (now in fact considered a copy of a Brueghel work), although highly atypical in many ways, combines several elements of [[Northern Renaissance]] painting. It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]] legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not even look up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.&lt;ref name="Heughebaert"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3667">'''Encapsulated knowledge''' is the value endowing meta-[[Resource-based view|resource]] originating from thought, reflection, or experience that is embedded in an artefact’s design and functionality.

==Properties==
Encapsulated knowledge may be considered that knowledge which is found in a complex physical form, concealed from the casual observer, but physically transferable and acquirable in a marketplace, and provides utility to those who have the [[tacit knowledge]] necessary to use it.  It is a recent addition to the [[Knowledge-based theory of the firm|knowledge-based view of the firm]].

Encapsulated knowledge differs from both [[tacit knowledge]] and [[explicit knowledge]].  Encapsulated knowledge is not tacit because it resides outside of the human mind.  It may also be distinguished from [[tacit knowledge]] in that it is ''a consequence of the application of tacit knowledge'' upon physical or material objects.

It is also useful to distinguish encapsulated knowledge from [[explicit knowledge]].  Encapsulated knowledge is not precisely explicit, even though this term has generally been juxtaposed with tacit knowledge, because it is knowledge ''concealed'' from its users, and explicitness implies observability.  Encapsulated knowledge is distinguishable from codified knowledge primarily along the dimension of observability which has implications for the appropriability of value.  The observability of explicit, codified knowledge makes it susceptible to misappropriation.  Encapsulated knowledge, on the other hand, facilitates the marketing of knowledge since it can only be partially misappropriated through expensive reverse engineering.

Finally, both codification and encapsulation are motivated by a desire to inexpensively transfer knowledge.  While codification is a process that reduces complexity, ''encapsulation preserves complexity''.  The value of encapsulation lies in the avoidance of the cost of learning to make use of the encapsulated knowledge.  For example, utility can be realized from the use of knowledge encapsulated in a computer or an automobile apart from having to learn why they work.  The vast majority of transactions that occur in consumer markets involve the purchase of some form of encapsulated knowledge.

[[File:Focus puller.jpg|thumb|right|A focus puller]]
A '''focus puller''', or 1st assistant camera, is a member of a [[film crew]]'s camera department whose primary responsibility is to maintain image [[Sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] on whatever subject or action is being filmed.

"Pulling focus" or "[[Racking focus|rack focusing]]" refers to the act of changing the [[Camera lens|lens]]'s focus distance setting in correspondence to a moving subject's physical distance from the focal plane.  For example, if an actor moves from 8m to 3m away from the focal plane within a shot, the focus puller will change the distance setting on the lens during the take in precise relation to the changing position of the actor.  Additionally, the focus puller may shift focus from one subject to another within the frame, as dictated by the specific requirements of the [[cinematic techniques|shot]].

A good focus puller will have an intimate knowledge of cinematographic and optical theory.  Depending on the parameters of a given shot, there is often very little room for error.  As such, the role of a focus puller is extremely important within the realm of a film production; a "soft" image will, in most circumstances, be considered unusable, since there is no way to fix such an error in post-production.  One must also consider that an actor may not be able to duplicate his or her best performance in a subsequent take, so the focus puller is expected to perform flawlessly on every take.  Because of these factors, some production personnel consider the focus puller to have the most difficult job on set.

British [[cinematographer]] [[Oliver Stapleton]] has written:
{{quote| The 1st AC (or Focus Puller) has one of the hardest jobs on the set. And it's one of those jobs that are never noticed until it is wrong. Then you get an almighty bollocking, or you get fired&amp;nbsp;... Focus Pulling not only involves what it sounds like, but also the Focus Puller "runs" the department, in the sense of taking care of all the camera gear, and making sure that everything is tickety-boo. I have my own camera, so it's treated very well! A focus puller relies heavily on the Operator to tell him if the shot is out of focus&amp;nbsp;— after all only the operator is actually looking through the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cineman.co.uk/#camera |title=Camera Department |work=So You Wanna Work in Movies? |first=Oliver |last=Stapleton |accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During production, 1st ACs are also responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all camera equipment and accessories, including; lenses, filters, batteries, film magazines/recording media, matte boxes, etc., as well as  configuring the camera and its accessories in multiple ways for different setups. 1st ACs arrive on set before the director, [[director of photography]] (DoP) and [[camera operator]], and ensures the camera and all required lenses are prepared for the day's shoot.  During filming, the 1st AC is responsible for moving the camera to each setup as directed by the Director of Photography. On larger budget productions, the camera is usually mounted on a dolly for most of the day, which is operated by the Dolly Grip.  At the end of each shooting day, 1st ACs clean the equipment and pack it up in preparation for the next day. If there is a problem with the rushes (such as a scratch on the film), the focus puller communicates with the film lab to fix any faults with the camera or film stock.

==Focus pulling==
Sharp focus is fundamental to reproducing a realistic, appealing image, and a viewer's attention is automatically drawn to sharper areas. When done correctly, good pulling goes mostly unnoticed by the audience.

The shooting of a scene typically begins with a blocking rehearsal, in which the various actors' positions are established.  During the rehearsal, the 2nd AC lays tape marks on the floor at all points an actor pauses movement. The actors then leave set to go through hair and makeup, and stand-ins come in to take their places at these various positions for the purposes of lighting, framing, and focus-mark setting.  Once a camera position is established by the director of photography and camera operator, the 1st AC begins to measure the various distances between the actors' marks and the focal plane of the camera. These distances are recorded in a series of grease pencil/pen marks on the focus barrel of the lens, and/or the marking disc on the follow focus device.  Using the stand-ins or 2nd AC, marks are checked through the viewfinder and/or the onboard monitor for accuracy.  Marks may be repositioned in order to provide specific framing desired, and the 1st AC must be aware of this and re-measure/re-set his marks accordingly.  Additionally, the 1st AC may have the 2nd AC lay down specific distance marks on the floor which will be referenced during the take as actors move between their marks, in order to assist in accurately adjusting the focus to the correct intermediate distances.

When the actors return to set, there is usually a rehearsal for camera in which the focus puller and operator will practice the shot and make sure everything has been set up properly. During a take, the focus puller modifies the focus based on the dialog, movement of the actors or subject, movement of the camera, the DoP's directions, and compensates on the fly for actors missing their marks or any unforeseen movement. In cases where an obstruction prevents the focus puller from seeing all his marks, he may request the 2nd AC call the marks for him over a 2-way radio during the shot.  In some situations, such as on long lenses, wide apertures, very close distances, or any combination of the three, a subject moving even a few millimeters may require immediate and very precise focus correction.

After a take, if the focus puller feels he's made a mistake—be it a  timing error, a missed mark, or any other issue which may have rendered some part of the take "soft," he or she will typically report this to the operator (who most likely noticed the error in the viewfinder) or director of photography, and may ask for another take if another wasn't already planned.

Traditionally, the focus puller used only his marks and his own well-developed sense of distance estimation to achieve good results.  Over the last decade, the increased use of digital cameras, higher-resolution [[video tap]]s and/or on-camera monitors have provided focus pullers with additional tools to help maintain proper focus. A high-definition monitor can be particularly useful when a fast-paced production simply does not allow time for the focus puller to set and check all marks that may be needed, or if no rehearsal will be provided.

Professional 1st ACs have many tricks for pulling focus in difficult situations or when accurate measurement is impossible.  Often, before a scene is even rehearsed or established, the 1st AC will take surveying measurements of the general environment in order to have a good idea of the distance between reference points, such as patterns on the floor or walls, furniture, and whatever else might be around. These reference measurements can be used to quickly establish rough distances between the camera and the subject in chaotic shooting circumstances.

In addition to keen eyesight, reflexes, and intuition, the focus puller's primary tools are a cloth or fiberglass tape measure, steel tape measure, laser rangefinder, and in some cases an on-camera ultrasonic rangefinder which provides a real-time distance readout mounted on the side of the mattebox or camera body.  In setups where the focus puller cannot touch the camera, such as on steadicam or crane shots, he or she will use a remote follow focus system, though some focus pullers prefer using a remote system at all times.

==Other duties==
At the end of a successfully shot scene, the focus puller will be called upon to "Check the gate". This involves removing the lens and inspecting, with the aid of a flashlight and magnifying glass, the aperture to which the film is held during exposure. The focus puller is looking for any foreign bodies, e.g. hair, bits of broken film, fluff etc., that would show on the film and therefore ruin the scene that has just been filmed. This obviously is only relevant to shooting on film: however, a similar task is required for digital movie cameras (although not nearly as often) which involves checking the sensor.

The 1st AC reports to the [[director of photography]], works alongside the [[camera operator]], and oversees the [[Clapper loader|2nd assistant camera]] (also known as the "clapper loader") and any other members of the camera department.

'''Gerontissa Gavrielia''' (Elder Gabriela), also known as '''Mother Gavrielia'''&lt;ref name="In Communion"/&gt; (15 October 1897 – 28 March 1992) was a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] nun, known for her care of the poor and sick. She was the second woman to be admitted to a Greek university and was a trained physiotherapist prior to taking up her religious calling at the age of 60.

==Biography==

She grew up in Constantinople and lived there until her family was deported during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] and sent to [[Thessaloniki]]. She entered the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], becoming the second woman ever admitted to a Greek university,&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; where she earned a degree in [[philosophy]]. She had previously graduated with a degree in [[botany]] at a Swiss university.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=23}} In 1932, she moved to Athens and cared for [[nursing home]] residents&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; until 1938 when she moved to England to study [[podiatry]] and [[physiotherapy]], where she remained until the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1945, Papayannis returned to Greece and began working with the [[American Farm School]] and [[Friends Relief Service]] in Thessaloniki,{{sfn|Marder|1979|p=215}}&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; until 1947, when she moved to Athens and opened a physiotherapy practice. For a decade she operated her office using funds from her paying clients to provide assistance to the poor. Upon the death of her mother, in 1954, she took a vow of poverty and gave all her worldly possessions away. The following year,&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; she moved to [[India]] to work with the poor and assist [[Baba Amte]] in his work with [[Leprosy|leper]] communities in India.&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki /&gt; After four years of providing free physiotherapy to the poor, Papayannis went to the [[Himalayan Mountains]], spending eleven months in solitude as a hermit.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; She then traveled to [[Landour]] where she met an American woman, who arranged for her to go to the monastery headed by Father Theodosius in [[Bethany]], in the [[Holy Land]] in 1960.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=25}} She arrived at the [[Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord]]{{#tag:ref|The Russian Orthodox archive account calls this monastery the "Monastery of Mary and Martha",&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; Brady calls it the "Monastery of St. Lazarus"&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; and the Orthodox Wiki calls it "the Monastery of Sts Mary and Martha in Bethany".&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki /&gt; The Greek Orthodox Church and St. Lazarus Monastery were not built until 1965.{{sfn|Murphy-O'Connor|2008|p=228}} According to the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission of Jerusalem, two British women, who became Orthodox tonsured nuns in 1932, took the religious names Mary and Martha. They organized a religious community in Bethany, called the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord. Soon after its founding, the church authorities moved the community to Gethsemane where they became attached to the [[Church of Mary Magdalene]]. Though its name officially remains the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord, it is often identified as the Convent of Mary Magdalene.&lt;ref name="Russian Ecclesiastical Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord|url=http://www.jerusalem-mission.org/bethany.html|publisher=Russian Ecclesiastical Mission|accessdate=8 December 2015|location=Jerusalem, Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="notes"}} and after accepting [[tonsure]] became a nun. After her three-year [[novitiate]], Papayannis took the name Gavrielia.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt;

Sister Gavrielia was sent to the [[Taizé Community]] in France by the Patriarch [[Athenagoras I of Constantinople]], though her assignment there was brief. She was then sent to the United States, where she toured ethnic Greek communities in seventeen states and accompanied many mentally ill patients to psychiatric hospitals in Europe.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} After nearly a decade of touring, speaking, and helping the sick, she was sent to East Africa for three years to do missionary work.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; Following a brief assignment in Germany, Sister Gavrielia was sent back to India,{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} where she remained for three years. In 1979, she was given use of an Athens apartment and became a "Gerontissa" (elder), counseling disciples and helping the sick over the next ten years. Near the end of her life, she retreated to a hermitage in [[Aegina]],&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; but when she developed [[Hodgkin's disease]] she returned to Athens. After a miraculous healing, she left Athens two years before her death and moved to the island of [[Leros]].{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} Gerontissa Gavrielia died on Leros on 28 March, 1992.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1996 a biography of her life entitled ''I Askitiki tis Agapis'' was published in Greek,&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; in 1999 the book was translated into English,{{sfn|Nun Gavrilia|1999|p=}} and in 2000 into Russian.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; It has since had 14 Greek editions, 2 English editions, and has been translated into Arabic, French and Serbian.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=21}}

The '''Goshen Players''' is a community theatre in [[Goshen, Connecticut]]. They occupy the Old Town Hall, located at the [[roundabout|rotary]] at the intersections of Routes 4 and 63. The Players are very proud to be the second oldest continuously performing theatre group in the state, Simsbury Light Opera being older by one year.

==History==
In 1949 the small group who gathered at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Albert Dolloff, wondering whether it would be possible to produce an [[operetta]], probably did not consider that they were initiating a springtime tradition in Goshen. The first group, like the present cast, was composed of a few members with professional experience and a majority of amateurs with varying stage experience. Their presentation of ''[[Trial By Jury]]'' was such a success that they gave request performances in [[Cornwall, Connecticut|Cornwall]], [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]], and West [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]]. Proceeds were divided between the Church of Christ, Congregational, and St. Thomas' Church, both of Goshen.

==The future==
The Goshen Players inaugurated their first full season in 2005 with a production of ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' in the fall and Urinetown the Musical in the spring of 2006. They will be presenting Neil Simon's Rumors as their fall production of the 2006-2007 season. A staged reading of Tom Dudzick's comedy "Greetings!" was performed in November 2006.

The '''Hall of Remembrance''' was a series of paintings and sculptures commissioned, in 1918, by the [[British War Memorials Committee]] of the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in commemoration of the dead of [[World War One]]. 

==History==
[[File:Spencer, Stanley (Sir) (RA) - Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing-Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing-Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916'' by [[Stanley Spencer]]]]
The artworks commissioned for the Hall of Remembrance were to be devoted to 'fighting subjects, home subjects and the war at sea and in the air' and were to be displayed in a specially built structure. The building was to be designed to accommodate a series of paintings based upon the dimensions of the large trptych, ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], one part of which is now in the [[National Gallery]].&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 13 November 2008|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/13/gassed-john-singer-sargent#|title = 'Gassed', by John Singer Sargent|format = |publisher = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was initiated by [[Lord Beaverbrook]], the then Minister of Information and echoed the scale of a war art programme he had launched for the government of Canada. Although the architect [[Charles Holden]] completed a design for the building, the plan was abandoned and those artworks that had been completed, along with works donated by [[Muirhead Bone]], [[William Orpen]] and Sir [[John Lavery]] were incorporated into the art collection that was part of the establishment of the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name="WW1Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2008|title=Art from the First World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USmalley"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ulrike Smalley|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-the-british-government-sponsored-the-arts-in-the-first-world-war |title=How The British Government Sponsored The Arts In The First World War  |date=|accessdate=28 September 2016|work=Imperial War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Holden's plans for the building have been lost, Muirhead Bone described the structure as a "kind of Pavilion", surrounded by a garden, with a main gallery leading to an oratory with a dedication to the "coming Brotherhood of Man for which we all pray."&lt;ref name="BTruth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Cork|publisher=Yale University Press &amp; The Barbican Art Gallery|year=1994|title=A Bitter Truth - Avant Garde Art and the Great War|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre piece of the Hall were to be  four 'super-pictures', each 20 feet long by 7 feet high and each on the theme of cooperation between Britain and its various allies.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merion Harries &amp; Susie Harries|publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |ISBN=0 7181 2314 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Orpen]] was offered the commission for the Britain and its Italian allies picture but refused, as he did not want to leave the Western Front for a trip to Italy. [[Augustus John]] accepted the commission to produce the Anglo-French super-picture but the painting, ''Junction of Our Lines with the French'' never materialised. [[John Singer Sargent]] was tasked with depicting Anglo-American cooperation but failed to find an appropriate scene whilst visiting the Somme and instead presented the picture known as ''[[Gassed (painting)|Gassed]]''. The fourth super-picture, of troops from the Empire, was never commissioned.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4385">'''Harlem Writers Guild''' (HWG) is the oldest organization of [[African-American]] writers, founded in 1950 by [[John Oliver Killens]], [[Rosa Guy]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], Willard Moore and Walter Christmas.&lt;ref name=HWG&gt;[http://theharlemwritersguild.org/about.html "About"], Harlem Writers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Harlem Writers Guild was set up as a forum where African-American writers could develop their craft. After funding for an organization active in the late 1940s called "The Committee for the Negro in the Arts" ended, these writers felt excluded from the mainstream literary culture of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald D. Jaynes, [http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/africanamericansociety/n308.xml "Harlem Writers Guild"], ''Encyclopedia of African American Society'', SAGE Publications, Inc., 2005, {{ISBN|9780761927648}}. Online September 15, 2007. DOI: 10.4135/9781412952507, {{ISBN|9781412952507}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The HWG was also part of the [[Black Arts Movement]] of the 1960s, and its rationale continues to be to develop and aid in the publication of works by writers of the [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theharlemwritersguild.org/index.html "Who We Are"], Harlem Writers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers who have been associated with the HWG include [[Lonne Elder III]], [[Douglas Turner Ward]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Paule Marshall]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maya Angelou]] and [[Sarah E. Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Gerald Fraser, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/obituaries/john-oliver-killens-71-author-and-founder-of-writers-group.html "John Oliver Killens, 71, Author And Founder of Writers' Group"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 30, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the HWG was honored by the [[United Nations]] (UN) Society of Writers.&lt;ref name=HWG /&gt; In 1986, John O. Killens estimated that members of the Harlem Writers Guild had produced more than 300 published works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, plays, and screenplays. Several have received literary acclaim. Past and present members include: Dr. John Henrik Clarke, Grace F. Edwards, Rosa Guy, Rachel DeAragon, John Oliver Killens, [[Walter Dean Myers]], [[Louise Meriwether]], Karen Robinson, Dr. Olubansile Abbas Mimiko and Sarah E. Wright, Audrey Lorde, Paule Marshall, [[Julian Mayfield]], [[Terry McMillan]], Robert McNatt, Lofton Mitchell, Wilbert Oliver, Funmi Osoba, [[Sidney Poitier]], Charles Russell, K. C. Washington, Minnette Coleman, Gammy Singer, [[Wilbert Tatum]], Brenda Wilkinson, [[Valerie Wilson Wesley]], Sarah Elizabeth Wright, Sandra L. West, [[Doris Jean Austin]], William H. Banks Jr., Wesley Brown, Rosemary Bray, [[Irving Burgie]], Judy C. Andrews, [[Godfrey Cambridge]], Andrea Broadwater, [[Alice Childress]], Ossie Davis, [[Ruby Dee]], James DeJongh, Lonne Elder III, Donis Ford, Bill William Forde, [[Lorraine Hansberry]], Bob Desverney, Dr. Beryl Dorsett, Sheila Doyle, Lloyd Hairston, Robert Hooks, Rose James, Alfonso Nicks, and Betty Ann Jackson. Among writers more recently added to the HWG roster are: Angela Dews, Cordenia Paige, Eartha Watts Hicks, Sylvia White, and Miriam Kelly Ferguson.

===Harlem Writers Guild Press===
In 2000, HWG announced a partnership with the digital publisher [[iUniverse]] to create its own imprint, Harlem Writers Guild Press. The anthology ''Beloved Harlem: A Literary Tribute to Black America's Most Famous Neighborhood'' (Random House, 2005), edited by William H. Banks Jr., former Executive Director of HWG, featured work by HWG members including Dr. John Henrik Clarke, Grace F. Edwards, Rosa Guy, Rachel DeAragon, John Oliver Killens, [[Walter Dean Myers]], [[Louise Meriwether]], Funmi Osoba, Diane Richards, Karen Robinson, Dr. Olubansile Abbas Mimiko and Sarah E. Wright.

'''Helmets for Peace''' is a work of art by [[Batuz]], consisting of military helmets and attached to them shields made of dyed paper pulp, straw and various other materials. The work of art aims to raise awareness among people about the important role of the peacekeeping missions of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr (2015). ''Helmets for Peace - Batuz: English''. Sandstein Verlag, Dresden. {{ISBN|978-3-95498-168-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Hans-Peter von Kirchbach]] (former General Inspector of the Bundeswehr) inspired Batuz to create a permanent installation from the helmets and the attached to them shields, which should turn into a symbol of peace to be followed by many armies around the world. In the summer of 2007 Batuz finished assembling the first installation of the work which was called “Helmets for Peace”. It was exhibited in an abandoned hall in [[Chemnitz]]. The work included 167 helmets and was 5,50 meter high and 11,30 meter wide.&lt;ref&gt;Batuz Foundation (2007). ''Helmets for Peace'' catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

The shields, which were used as vital parts of the artwork "Helmets for Peace", have been painted five years earlier by dozens of international artists in another project – the “border crossing” at the Neisse River at the border between Germany and Poland in 2002, in which the [[Bundeswehr]] played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;Batuz Foundation &amp; Auswärtiges Amt der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (2003). ''no más fronteras''. Kloster Altzella/Nossen&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 “Helmets for Peace” was vandalized and a few weeks later disassembled and stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Mehlhorn, Th. "Star-Künstler packt ein", BILD, July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of General Hans-Peter von Kirchbach and Minister [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] (at that time Parliamentary State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of Defence) "Helmets for Peace" found a new home in the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr]]. The exhibition opening took place on March 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Rieckmann, Adina. MDR Sachsenspiegel. March 4, 2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5ZJCO07X9Q&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Dr. [[Dieter Ronte]] acknowledges the importance of “Helmets for Peace”, drawing similarities to [[Picasso]]'s artwork [[Guernica]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronte, Dieter (2007). ''Batuz - Helmets for Peace'' http://societeimaginaire.net/prof-dr-dieter-ronte-batuz-helmets-for-peace/&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1959, as portraitist, he painted the entire [[Barakzai dynasty|Afghan Royal Family]]. From about 1960 on, he was noted as an abstract painter influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic calligraphy]] and by the American "[[action painting]]" idiom.

==Biography==

Gulgee was born on 26 October 1926 at Karimpura locality in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. Initially, he went to [[Lawrence College Murree]] and then to [[Aligarh University]] to study civil engineering before heading off to the US for continuing his higher education. Gulgee started to paint while acquiring his training as an engineer in the United States at [[Columbia University]] and then [[Harvard]]. His first exhibition was in 1950.

Gulgee was a gifted and consummately skilled naturalistic [[portrait]] painter who had enjoyed (according to Partha Mitter) "lavish state support" and plenty of elite commissions in this capacity. Nevertheless, he was perhaps best known worldwide for his [[abstract art|abstract]] work, which was inspired by [[Islamic calligraphy]] and was also influenced by the "[[action painting]]" movement of the 1950s and 1960s (Mitter notes that [[Elaine Hamilton-O'Neal|Elaine Hamilton]] was a strong influence in this direction). This is perhaps a natural enough stylistic combination since in both Islamic calligraphy and action painting a high value is placed on the unity and energy of gestural flow. As with the works of other action painters or [[abstract expressionist]]s, Gulgee's canvases were often quite large. He was also known for using materials such as mirror glass and gold or silver leaf in his oil paintings, so that they were in fact [[mixed media]] pieces.

According to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (see external links): "Gulgee's calligraphy paintings are abstract and gestural interpretations of [[Arabic]] and [[Urdu]] letters. His sweeping layers of paint explore the formal qualities of oil paint while they make references to [[Islamic]] design elements." [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm]

Beginning in the 1960s (if not earlier), Gulgee also created sculptures, including bronze pieces that were (like so many of his paintings) calligraphic in form and inspiration, and sometimes specifically based on verses from the [[Quran]] [source:artnet.com].

His paintings were bright and full of color, but the paint was put on with great sensitivity, and paintings vibrate with intense feeling. Areas sing with luminous, thin color; thick blobs of paint pulsate with fiberglass tears, the brush swirls strong and free. The total effect used to be very free, yet considered and well thought out. They work enormously well, because it was all orchestrated with great care and concentration.

His son [[Amin Gulgee]] is also a famous artist.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

[Note: the name is also spelled "Guljee", "Gulji", or "Gulgi" in some sources.]

==International and special assignments==

Guljee, as he was famously known, received many requests for his paintings internationally, from the [[Saudi royal family]] to the [[Islamabad presidency]]. Many of his works are placed in the [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Guljee received many awards, including from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Japan and France.

==Exhibition and personal life==

Gulgee's exhibitions have mostly been available to few people. Keeping that in mind and high demand from public and lovers of his works, an art gallery for Gulgee has been built in [[Clifton, Karachi]] near [[South City Hospital]] and [[Sea View Karachi]]. Gulgee mostly painted for his own inspirations and vision. Although selected paintings are available for sale in Gulgee art gallery. Gulgee was last based in Boat Basin in Karachi. He has a son [[Amin Gulgee]].

==Murder==

Gulgee, his wife Zarrin Gulgee and a maid were found dead by strangulation&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; in their house on the evening of 19 December 2007 by his servants. Police suspect that all three had been murdered.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7151914.stm] While the bodies were found on the 19th, officials report that they had apparently been deceased for three days, leading to a speculative death date of 16 December 2007. Their bodies were found bound and gagged in separate rooms of the house. The initial cause of death for all three has been attributed to suffocation. According to press reports, his son reported that Gulgee's car and driver are missing. Gulgee was buried on the evening of 20 December 2007 in Karachi.

'''''It's Such a Beautiful Day''''' is an [[Experimental film|experimental]] [[black comedy]]-[[Drama (genre)|drama]] [[animated film]] directed, written, animated, and produced by [[Don Hertzfeldt]] as his first [[feature film]]. The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and [[absurdism|absurdist]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.

== Plot ==
Bill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.

Bill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.

The film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the "special" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and "a brain as misshapen as his legs". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one—his great-great-uncle—was outcast from town and "died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon."

A few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. 

Bill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.

Bill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been confabulated. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.

Bill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.

Going to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, "It's such a beautiful day." The screen cuts to black.

The Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him. Bill outlives the human race, surpassing the next inhabitants of the Earth who revere him as a god. He continues living until the Earth is destroyed by the Sun, continuing even when that has gone as well. Floating in space, Bill observes the stars going out, until the screen cuts to black.

==Release==

The three chapters of the film were originally produced and released independently as animated short films, captured entirely on 35mm film with in-camera special effects.

The first installment, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', was released in 2006 and won the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Prize for Short Film. The second installment, ''[[I Am So Proud of You]]'' was released in 2008. The third and final chapter of the trilogy, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', shares the same name as the feature-length movie and was released in 2011 to similar acclaim, including the Audience Award from the Ottawa International Animation Festival.

In 2015, Hertzfeldt began a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Kickstarter]] for a [[Blu-Ray]] release consisting of both the feature version of ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', as well as his 2015 short, ''[[World of Tomorrow (film)|World of Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref name=BlurayAV&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Danette|title=Get Involved, Internet: Fund a Blu-ray release of Don Hertzfeldt’s World Of Tomorrow|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/get-involved-internet-fund-blu-ray-release-don-her-222556|website=AVClub|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the campaign, backers had raised more than seven times the needed amount.&lt;ref name=BlurayAV/&gt;

==Critical response==
''It's Such a Beautiful Day''  received wide acclaim from film critics. On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds [[list of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating of 100%]] based on 29 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A collection of three shorts by Don Hertzfeldt, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' is an impossibly dense and affecting piece of animated art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Such a Beautiful Day (2012)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/its_such_a_beautiful_day|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film holds a score of 90/100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 7 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/its-such-a-beautiful-day-2012 |title=It's Such a Beautiful Day Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of ''The Chicagoist'' wrote, "There is a moment in each installment of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed to make me feel this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning."&lt;ref name="chicagoist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoist.com/2012/02/28/cult_animator_don_hertzfeldt_at_the.php|title=Don Hertzfeldt at the Music Box|work=Chicagoist|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=28 February 2012|last=Pate|first=Steven|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819222030/http://chicagoist.com/2012/02/28/cult_animator_don_hertzfeldt_at_the.php|archivedate=19 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named it their runner-up for Best Animated Feature Film of the year, behind ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''. Indiewire ranked Hertzfeldt the 9th best Film Director of the Year in its annual poll (tied with [[Wes Anderson]]), and film critics for ''The A.V. Club'' ranked the film #8 on their list of the Best Films of 2012. Slate Magazine named ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' their pick for Best Animated Feature Film of 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the United Kingdom, the film was ranked #3 on Time Out London's list of the 10 Best Films of 2013, and #4 on The London Film Review's list of the same. In 2014, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' ranked ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' #16 on their list of the "100 Best Animated Movies Ever Made." Critic Tom Huddleston described it as "one of the great outsider artworks of the modern era, at once sympathetic and shocking, beautiful and horrifying, angry and hilarious, uplifting and almost unbearably sad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huddleston|first1=Tom|title=The 100 best animated movies: the list|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/movies/100-best-animated-movies-list#tab_panel_9|website=Time Out|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Peeters the Elder''' or '''Johannes Peeters''' (24 April 1624 &amp;ndash; 1677) was a Flemish [[Flemish Baroque painter|Baroque painter]] and draughtsman. He is known for his [[seascape]]s often depicting stormy seas and shipwrecks as well as for his topographical drawings.&lt;ref name="vlieghe"&gt;Hans Vlieghe (1998).

==Life==
[[File:Jan Peeters (I) - Stormy Sea.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Stormy sea'']]
Peeters was born in [[Antwerp]] as the son of Cornelis Peeters and Catharina van Eelen.  He was the brother of the painters [[Gillis Peeters|Gillis]], [[Bonaventura Peeters (I)|Bonaventura I]] and [[Catharina Peeters|Catharina]]. He studied with his brothers Bonaventura and Gillis as well as Joannes Boots.  He became a master of Antwerp's [[Guild of St. Luke]] in 1645.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;
[[File:Jan Peeters (I) - The Frozen Scheldt in Antwerp.jpg|thumb|250px|''The frozen Scheldt in Antwerp'']]
He was active in Hoboken near Antwerp from 1645 to 1654, likely working in his brother Bonaventura’s workshop.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt;  In 1654 he married Catherine Buseliers and moved back to Antwerp. The couple had two children, Johannes Franciscus and Isabella.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/62372  Jan Peeters (I)] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johannes Franciscus became a painter about whom very little is known with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/323165 Johannes Franciscus Peeters] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1659 Jan Peeters spent six months in the [[Dutch Republic]] drawing panoramas of several towns and harbours. These were later engraved by [[Gaspar Bouttats]].&lt;ref name=moust&gt;[http://www.jeanmoust.com/index.cfm?page=artist-index&amp;cat=4149&amp;subcat=8360&amp;aid=673476&amp;artist=Peeters,%20Attributed%20to%20Jan%20I About Jan Peeters I] at Jean Moust&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his many drawings of distant locations he is believed to have travelled throughout France, Italy, [[Libya]], Cairo and Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;  However, it is equally possible that for some of these drawings he relied on designs of other artists, such as his nephew [[Bonaventura Peeters (II)|Bonaventura II]] who was reportedly a merchant sailor as well as an artist.

He was the teacher of [[Adriaen van Bloemen]]. He died in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Jan Peeters (I) - Ships and a Galley Wrecked on a Rocky Coast.jpg|thumb|250px|''Ships and a Galley Wrecked on a Rocky Coast'']]
Jan’s brother Bonaventura was a master in the painting of dramatic shipwrecks with dark billowy clouds.  Jan was trained by his brother and painted marine subjects in a style similar to that of his brother without reaching, however, the same level of painterly excellence.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0243.htm Johannes Peeters biography] in: [[Arnold Houbraken]], ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'', 1718 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His subjects ranged from domestic marine scenes to Mediterranean settings.  Some paintings represent naval battles and naval attacks on fortresses.  He painted rough seas with shipwrecks and ships sailing in calm waters.  He was good at representing atmospheric conditions, especially of clouds.&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;  He also painted city views and architectural landscapes as well as some portraits.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;PID=GJ-10421&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=16&amp;thumbFile=%2Ftmplobs%2FPF_40DS451FT%247JRKM6.jpg&amp;embViewVer=noEmb&amp;comeFrom=quick&amp;sorting=no&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=29&amp;tmCond=peeters&amp;searchIndex=TAGFILEN&amp;author=Peeters%2C%26%2332%3BJan Peeters, Jan., Architectural Landscape] at the [[State Hermitage]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Peeters is also known for his topographical drawings of various locations that were used as designs by different engravers.  [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] engraved in 1651 a set of six river and coastal views of places in the Dutch Republic after drawings of Jan Peeters.  Hollar also made engravings of oriental views after drawings by Jan Peeters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=111972%2B120831 Engravings by Wenceslaus Hollar after Jan Peeters] at the [[British Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish engraver [[Gaspar Bouttats]] etched the 14 plates for a [[Folio (printing)|folio]] volume of city views of Jerusalem and the surrounding areas published in 1672 by the publisher [[Jacob Peeters]] under the title ''Views from Arabia, Judea, Chaldea, Syria, Jerusalem, Antiochia, Aleppo, Mecca etc.'' after drawings by Jan Peeters (I).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Views+from+Arabia,+Judea,+Chaldea&amp;images=true ''Views from Arabia, Judea, Chaldea, Syria, Jerusalem, Antiochia, Aleppo, Mecca etc.''] at the British Museum website&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jan Peeters (I) - View of Mâcon Seen from the East.jpg|thumb|left|360px|''View of Mâcon Seen from the East'']]

Bouttats also used drawings by Jan Peeters (I) for the 1674 publication ''Thooneel der Steden ende Sterckten van t'Vereenight Nederlandt met d'aengrensende Plaetsen soo in Brabandt Vlaenderen als anden Rhijn en elders verovert door de Waepenen der Groot-moghende Heeren Staeten onder het gheley vande seer Edele Hooghghebore Princen va Oranien'' (Scene of the Cities and the Forts of the United Netherlands with the Neighbouring Places like Brabant, Flanders and on the Rhine and Conquered Elsewhere by the Weapons of the Great and Mighty Sovereign States under the Leadership of the Very Noble Prince of Orange).  This last work offered city views of the major cities and forts in the Dutch Republic, Flanders and along the Rhine.&lt;ref name=br&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092716962#page/n5/mode/2up "Bouttats, Gaspar"] in Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawings by Jan Peeters were the basis for some of the prints engraved by Gaspar Bouttats and [[Lucas Vorsterman II]] for the publication by Jacob Peeters in Antwerp of several sets of prints issued under the title ''Description des principales villes, havres et isles du golfe de Venise du cote oriental, comme aussi des villes et fortresses de la Moree et quelques places de la Grece et es isles principales de l'Archipel et fortresses dícelles et en suittes quelques places renommées de la Terre Saincte, et autres dessous la domination Ottomane vers le Midij et l'Orient, et quelques principales villes en Perse et le regne du Grand Mogol le tout en Abrege.''

'''Jonathan David Anthony Bowden''' (12 April 1962 – 29 March 2012)&lt;ref&gt;[http://efp.org.uk/jonathan-bowden-1962-2012/ Jonathan Bowden 1962-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[Far-right politics in the United Kingdom|far-right]] writer and politician. 

==Early life and formal education==
Bowden was born in [[Kent]], [[England]], and attended [[Elvian School|Presentation College]] in Reading, Berkshire. His mother died when he was 16 years old. In 1984, he completed one year of a Bachelor of Arts history degree course at [[Birkbeck College]], [[London University]], as a mature student, but left without graduating. He subsequently enrolled at [[Wolfson College Cambridge|Wolfson College]], [[Cambridge University]], in autumn 1988, but left after a few months.

==Political career==
===Conservative Party===
He began his political career as a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[Bethnal Green and Stepney]] Constituency Association.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. In 1990, he joined the Conservative [[Monday Club]], and the following year made an unsuccessful bid to be elected onto its Executive Council. In 1991, he was appointed co-chairman with Stuart Millson of the club's media committee,&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Club News'', July 1991 edition, p.2. – Monday Club Executive Council Minutes, 13 May 1991. This position did not, however, afford Bowden a seat on the Council&lt;/ref&gt;  and was also active in the [[Western Goals (UK)|Western Goals Institute]].&lt;ref name="Interview with Bowden"&gt;[http://www.jonathanbowden.co.uk/interview.html Interview with Bowden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807084040/http://www.jonathanbowden.co.uk/interview.html |date= 7 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Bowden was expelled from the Monday Club.&lt;ref name="Gable"&gt;Sonia Gable and Adam Carter, [http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/new-right-chairman-dies "New Right chairman dies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121083653/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/new-right-chairman-dies |date=21 November 2015 }}, ''Searchlight'', 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary Conservative Caucus===
Bowden and Stuart Millson co-founded the [[Revolutionary Conservative Caucus]] in November 1992&lt;ref&gt;''The Revolutionary Conservative'', issue no.2, 1993, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of introducing "abstract thought into the nether reaches of the Conservative and Unionist party".&lt;ref name="Interview with Bowden"/&gt; The group published a quarterly journal entitled ''The Revolutionary Conservative Review''. By the end of 1994, Millson and Bowden parted company and the group dissolved.

In 1993, Bowden published the book ''Right'' through the European Books Society. He was also reported to be a prominent figure in the creative milieu responsible for the emergence of ''[[Right Now! (magazine)|Right Now!]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/othersrv/isar/archives2/genewar/ritenow.htm Right Now!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom Party===
Bowden then joined the [[Freedom Party (UK)|Freedom Party]], for which he was treasurer for a short time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedompartyuk.net/public/partynews/index.html Freedom Party website]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in company with [[Adrian Davies (barrister)|Adrian Davies]] was a member of the Bloomsbury Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/uk.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221154441/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/uk.htm |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British National Party===
In 2003, Bowden broke with attempts to influence [[Conservatism]] and moved into political activity by joining the [[British National Party]] (BNP), becoming a popular speaker. He was appointed Cultural Officer, a position its leader [[Nick Griffin]] created to give Bowden officer status within the organisation. However, in July 2007, Bowden resigned and left the BNP.

Although he resumed public speech-making at BNP organised meetings in the localities away from the party's national events, he never re-joined the party and cut all ties after the May 2010 general election.

===London Forum===

Bowden made speeches on many topics to The London Forum, a far-right discussion forum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jonathan+bowden YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative works ==
Bowden was an artist whose works are collected in three book volumes.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

He appeared in two avant-garde films, ''Venus Flytrap'' (2005) and ''Grand Guignol'' (2009), both directed by the Italian film-maker Andrea Lioy.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Death==
Bowden died of heart failure at his home in [[Berkshire]] on 29 March 2012, aged 49.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

'''Jēkabs Bīne''' (11 April 1895-24 October 1955) was a Latvian painter, [[stained glass]] artist, teacher and art critic.

== Biography ==
Jēkabs Bīne was born in [[Riga]] in 1895 in merchant family. He studied at the [[Riga City Art School]] (1913-1915), [[Kharkov Art School]] (1915-1918) and the [[Art Academy of Latvia]] (1921–1926).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jekabs-bine/biography Jekabs Bine Biography]. [[Artnet]].&lt;/ref&gt; His graduation work from [[Jānis Tilbergs]]' figurative painting class at the Art Academy was the painting ''Resurrection''. He held teaching positions throughout his life: at the Art Studio of the Latvian People University (1928-1940), Riga People University, Institute of Housekeeping in Kaucminde (1932-1939), at the Riga State Art of Craft School (1933-1944), at the School of the Riga society of painters (1936-1939), at the Art Academy of Latvia (1942-1944), at the Kuldiga Secondary Art School (1944-1951), and at combine "Art" (1951-1955).&lt;ref name="paintings"&gt;[http://paintings.lv/en/artist/55?view=about Jekabs Bine]. Galerija Jēkabs.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first solo exhibition was held in 1917. In the 1920s he painted Christian subjects, including the altarpieces for the churches in Cesvaines (1924), Jumprava (1926) and Vecsaule (1927). His focus on sacral painting developed into an interest in Latvian mythology, [[idealism]] and an ambition to connect art to folk culture and nature.&lt;ref name="paintings" /&gt; He studied the symbols of Latvian ornamentation and incorporated this in his art. He became involved in [[Ernests Brastiņš]]' [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] movement [[Dievturība]] and became one of its main public promotors.&lt;ref name="opentheology"&gt;Anita Stasulane, Gatis Ozoliņš. [https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opth.2017.3.issue-1/opth-2017-0019/opth-2017-0019.pdf Transformations of Neopaganism in Latvia: From Survival to Revival]. ''[[Open Theology]]'' 2017; 3: 239–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1940 and throughout the [[Stalinist]] era this was repressed as "bourgeois art". Bīne's diaries show that he was disappointed with the direction of Soviet authorities set out for art and viewed it as vulgarization. He did however adapt to the new regime. As part of his acceptance of a position as a [[stained glass]] specialist in 1951, he wrote a 1952 paper titled ''Ornament'' in which he condemned his previous views on Latvian ornamentation.&lt;ref name="opentheology" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2568">The '''Kaosikii''' or '''Kaos'ikii dance''' is a dance invented on September 6, 1978 by the [[India]]n [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and social reformer [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] aka Shrii Shrii Anandamurti (1921–1990).

Sarkar claims the ''kaos'ikii'' dance is a psycho-physical exercise which would benefit the mind by developing mental stamina and strength. Some hints to this dance are also contained in the speech "The Cosmic Father Has a Special Responsibility" given in [[Madras]] ([[India]]) on December 4, 1978 and later published in "''Ánanda Vacanámrtam'' Part 6, Chapter 5"{{sfn|Anandamurti|1979}}&lt;ref&gt;The ''Ánanda Vacanámrtam'' ("Blissful Discourses") series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by P. R. Sarkar aka Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Discourses on ''Tantra'' Volume Two, Chapter 23".{{sfn|Anandamurti|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;This book, a compilation of discourses of the author, is the second of two volumes and discloses much about the actual practice of Tantra.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

“The name Kaoshikii comes from the Sanskrit word kosha, meaning “layer of mind”. Kaoshikii develops the subtler layers of mind, cultivating the feeling of mysticism – the endeavour to establish a link between the finite and the infinite – in one’s consciousness. It instils self-confidence and encourages self-expression."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.anandamarga.org/ideology/self-realization/kaoshikii/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''art of Kazakhstan''' covers all forms of art created by the peoples living in the modern territory of [[Kazakhstan]] throughout its history. The great majority of the art of Kazakhstan is [[applied art]], the decoration of practical objects, such as weaving carpets, pottery and leatherwork, decorating of household utensils and harness decorated with patterns. At most historical periods, much of the population of Kazakhstan was nomadic, or at least moved regularly across the vast country.  The art of Kazakhstan also includes architecture, [[fine arts]], and sculpture. 

Though modern Kazakhs are often keen to assert its national character, Kazakh art has at most times been intimately connected with wider artistic styles, in particular the [[Scythian art]] of the first millenium BC, and [[Islamic art]] from the eighth century AD onwards. In the 19th and 20th centuries [[Russian art]] was the dominant influence.

=== Prehistory ===
Among the diversity of monuments of the historical past, a prominent place belongs to the art of the ancient man - engravings and paintings on the rocks. On the territory of [[Kazakhstan]], the first type of these monuments is especially common, [[petroglyph]]s - drawings on the rocks, embossed with stone or metal tools. Due to the absence of anthropogenic impact on most of the territory of Kazakhstan, many monuments have been preserved, which are studied by experts. The specifics of the Kazakhstan relief and the peculiarities of the rocks that make up the mountain ranges cause widespread of petroglyphs.

The first examples of fine art in Kazakhstan belong to the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic era]]. They are found in the mountains of [[Karatau Mountains|Karatau]] and Hantau in the form of images of animals carved on the rocks. Petroglyphs of the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] in the Bayanaulsky cave (Pavlodar region), in the Tanbaly&lt;!-- is this the TAMGALY???? --&gt; gorge (Almaty region) (on the images - elk, lion, hunter with a bow, ox, harnessed to a cart, cow, etc.) and drawings on the stones of the north the shores of [[Lake Balkhash|Lake Balkash]] (a duel between two men with sabers, next to which a girl stands, and others) give an idea of the main occupations and customs of the tribes inhabiting the Kazakh land.

One of the most ancient and vivid monuments of the [[Zhetysu|Semirechie]] rock art is the petroglyphs of the [[Tamgaly]] archaeological complex, located 170 km north-west of the city of [[Almaty]] in the Anrakai Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogozhinsky|first=A.E.|date=2008-12-01|title=PETROGLYPH SITES OF KAZAKHSTAN AND WESTERN CENTRAL ASIA AS PART OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE: NEW CHALLENGES|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1563011009000117|journal=Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=83–94|doi=10.1016/j.aeae.2009.03.009|issn=1563-0110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petroglyphs were discovered in 1957 by an archaeological expedition of the [[Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences]] under the direction of A. G. Maximova. There was a sanctuary with a large number of cave paintings. Its study began in the 1970-1980s. Most petroglyphs are located in the lower part of the main gorge and in the side of the gorge adjacent to it from the west. Here you can see about 2000 rock paintings. 

The themes of the drawings are very diverse: people, animals, horsemen, scenes of hunting people, scenes of hunting predatory animals, scenes from people's lives, ritual dances, sun-headed deities, as well as multi-figure compositions depicting people and animals, scenes of hunting animals and scenes of bull sacrifice. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beisenov|first=A.Z.|last2=Dzhumabekova|first2=G.S.|last3=Bazarbayeva|first3=G.A.|last4=Kassenalin|first4=A.E.|date=2014-03|title=The World of Images in the Art of the Ancient Population of the Central Kazakhstan (1 Millennium BC)|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=122|pages=194–198|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.1326|issn=1877-0428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common images are drawings of horses, deers and eagles. Deers are symbols of power and beauty and eagle represent sky and immortality in the Kazakh art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toleubayev|first=Abdesh|last2=Zhumatayev|first2=Rinat|last3=Baimuhamedova|first3=Dina|date=2014-03|title=Image of an Eagle in the Art of the Early Nomads|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=122|pages=240–244|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.1335|issn=1877-0428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omarov|first=Gani|last2=Baigunakov|first2=Dosbol|last3=Sabdenova|first3=Gulmira|date=2014-03|title=The Deer in Iron Age Art in Central Asia: The Common Trends in Perception of Images|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=122|pages=269–272|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.1341|issn=1877-0428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bronze Age]] the area of modern Kazakhstan was inhabited by people of the [[Andronovo culture]], with the [[Begazy-Dandybai culture]] is southern parts. In the Andronovo culture there was exploitation of metal ores, including gold, and probably silver, as well as copper.  In places this was on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Kuz'mina, 89-94&lt;/ref&gt;  Although significant survivals are very rare, it is clear that textiles, mostly in wool, were in general use for clothing, along with leather and fur.  Clothing was often richly decorated with metal and stone jewellery.  By the [[Iron Age]], Greek descriptions of steppe nomad dress survive, and Greek and Persian depictions of related steppes peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Kuz'mina, 101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protohistory===
[[File:Golden Man in Central State Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan.jpg|alt=Golden Man in Central State Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan|thumb|252x252px|Golden Man replica in the Central State Museum]]
In the first millennium BC, the territory of present-day Kazakhstan in the area of the [[Ili River]] belonged to the [[Saka]]s tribes, whose works of art formed part of the wider tradition of [[Scythian art]] from across the whole [[Eurasian steppe]].  Most survivals have come from [[kurgan]] burial mounds.  The most famous discovery of the Sakas era is the "[[Issyk_kurgan#"Golden_man"|Golden Man]]" - the costume of a wealthy Saka man or woman, decorated with gold chased plates. "Golden Man" was found in the [[Issyk kurgan]] (burial mound) in south-eastern Kazakhstan near Almaty city in 1969. Most of the armor, boots and hat are decorated with many gold plates, which makes the found object resemble a statue made of precious metal. Most of the jewelry found was made of gold by casting, stamping, embossing and engraving in the form of a circular sculpture, high relief and bas-relief. 

The head is crowned with a hat in the form of a high peaked turban, decorated with golden plates depicting horses, snow leopards, birds and trees with spreading crowns. The neck is decorated with a golden hoop with tips in the form of tiger heads. In the lobe of the left ear, the "Golden Man" wore a gold earring with a turquoise ornament. To the right of the belt, a sword in a sheath covered with red leather is attached, and an iron dagger in the sheath with gold overlays in the form of a galloping moose and a horse is suspended on the left. On both sides of the dagger on the gold plates are carved figures of wolf, fox, mountain sheep, fallow deer, fox, snake and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Ancient Türkic script|last=Amanzholov|first=A. S.|date=2003|publisher="Mektep"|isbn=978-9965162046|location=Almaty|pages=|oclc=53876767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tall hat compares with the tall [[Kazakh_clothing#Headgear|saukele]] head-dress that is today part of the traditional wedding costume for Kazakh women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9709/abstracts/gold.html Archaeology magazine - Chieftain or Warrior Priestess?]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The treasures of the Issyk mound, including an exact copy of the "Golden Man", were exhibited at the Kazakh Museum of Archeology, located in Almaty, and are now at the State Museum of Gold and Precious Metals of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Astana.

The "golden man" on the winged leopard became one of the main symbols of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chang|first=Claudia|date=2017-08-16|title=Rethinking Prehistoric Central Asia|doi=10.4324/9781315173696|isbn=9781315173696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many "balbals" or [[kurgan stelae]], [[monolith]]s shaped as a human figure, have been found topping kurgans, or surrounding them in groups.

=== Islamic period ===
[[File:Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in Hazrat-e Turkestan, Kazakhstan.jpg|alt=Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in Hazrat-e Turkestan, Kazakhstan|thumb|[[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi]], in the city of [[Turkistan (city)|Turkistan]], 1389.]]
In the Middle Ages, in the territory of modern Kazakhstan various states successively replaced each other, trade was actively carried out within the [[Silk Road|Great Silk Road]], which enriched the culture of the people who lived here with new techniques of art and, in general, influenced the spheres of application of the creative potential of local artists. 

The centres of culture, religion, trade, the connection between agricultural oases and nomadic steppe, between East and West on the Great Silk Road were cities in the valleys of the rivers [[Syr Darya|Syrdarya]], Talas, [[Chu River|Chu]], [[Ili River|Ili]] - Isfidzhab, Yangikent, Suyab, Kayalyk Mirki, Kulan.

The centers of culture, science and art of the Middle Ages were the cities of [[Otrar]], [[Taraz]], [[Balasagun]], Sygnak, [[Sawran (Kazakhstan)|Sauran]] and many others. The mausoleums of Babaji-Khatun (X-XI centuries), [[Aisha Bibi|Aisha-Bibi]] (XI-XII centuries), Alash-khan (XII-XIV centuries), Dzhuchi-khan (XIII century), mausoleum of  Kozy-Korpesh and Bayan-Slu (VIII – X centuries) and the tower of Tamerlane (XIV century) are considered to be unique architectural monuments of this time. Of the monuments located in the south of Kazakhstan, the Mausoleum of [[Ahmad Yasawi|Khoja Ahmed Yassavi]] in the city of [[Turkistan (city)|Turkestan]] stands out for its monumentality, consisting of a whole complex of premises and one of the largest architectural monuments of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The mausoleum was built by order of [[Timur]] (XIV century) in honor of the preacher Yassavi. The mausoleum was built of burnt bricks and laid out inside and out with multi-colored tiles of blue and white, decorated with carved and type-setting mosaic, painted majolica. A huge cauldron-cauldron located in a mausoleum of great artistic value, cast from an alloy of seven metals, can now be seen in the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]].

In the XIV-XV centuries, great progress was made in the use of structures such as arches, vaults, domes. Particular attention was paid to the quality of bricks, which mostly had a square shape. One side of the brick was painted blue, blue, white or green. Therefore, such a brick was laid for cladding simultaneously with the laying of external walls. Polychrome [[majolica]] tiles were also used in the decoration of the walls. In the interiors began to use [[mural]]s, relief ornaments. Applied art was widely used in the construction of the mausoleums of [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi|Khoja Ahmed Yasawi]], Kok-Kesen and Alash Khan. Medieval builders attached great importance to the quality of the building material: already at that time, brick and glazed paint of particular strength were made.

In the Middle Ages, such types of applied art as weaving carpets and [[pottery]] became widespread in Kazakhstan. The carpets, richly decorated with national patterns, served both to adorn the dwellings of the Kazakhs and to protect them from the weather and cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenzhebekovna|first=Kalshabayeva Bibiziya|last2=Nagima|first2=Sarmurzina|date=2014-03|title=Some Features of Decorative and Applied Arts of Kazakhs in Central Asia|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=122|pages=110–113|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.1311|issn=1877-0428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often found patterns of carpets, household items and kitchen utensils are floral patterns, hunting scenes, folk games, as well as images of animals and birds. The image of horses as the central part of the fine art is found everywhere throughout Kazakhstan. The horse personifies the beauty and power in the art of the Kazakhs. Also, horses were very important as a vehicle, especially in wartime. Horses were also sacrificed to gods and buried alongside warriors in burial mounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhumatayev|first=Rinat|last2=Kozhabekova|first2=Zhanar|date=2014-03|title=Image of a Horse in Rock Art of Medieval Kazakhstan|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=122|pages=157–161|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.1319|issn=1877-0428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, pottery items were often decorated with inscriptions in different languages - Turkic, Uigur, Sogdian and others. One example of such art is the ceramic inscriptions found in the archaeological city of [[Aktobe]], located in the middle reaches of the Chu River. Many inscriptions found on this ceramics date back to the 9th-11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akymbek|first=Yeraly|last2=Baibugunov|first2=Beibit|date=2014-03|title=Inscriptions on Ceramics of Medieval City Aktobe|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=122|pages=77–81|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.1306|issn=1877-0428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern period ===

Fine art in its classical sense has been developed in Kazakhstan since the 19th century. The impetus to the beginning of such a development was the work of Russian artists who committed expeditions to Central Asia, and portrayed on their canvases those images and paintings that were born to them here: [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], Nikolai Khludov. The latter had a special influence on the formation of the local school of painting, becoming a teacher of many local artists. The most famous among them is [[Abilkhan Kasteev|Abilkhan Kasteyev]], whose name is now called the State Museum of Art of Kazakhstan.

In full, the Kazakh school of art was formed by the 40s of the twentieth century, and in the 50s it flourished. Local painters, graphic artists, sculptors, who received education as part of the unified Soviet system of preparing artists, began to actively create, often using national motifs in their work. The names of such painters as O. Tansykbaev, J. Shardenov, K. Telzhanov, S. Aitbaev, graphic artists E. Sidorkina, A. Duzelkhanov, sculptors H. Nauryzbaeva, E. Sergebaeva today make up the pride of Kazakhstani art.

At the end of the 80s, an avant-garde direction was formed in Kazakhstan, aimed at finding fresh ideas and protest against established forms and images in the art. In Kazakhstan painting various plastic principles began to appear, such as in the works of B. Tulkeev - super-complex psychological compositions, A. Sydykhanov - mystical graphic compositions, A. Akanaeva - improvised compositions, like Picasso, D. Aliyev - chaotic figurative solutions. The paintings by K. Duisenbaev are filled with expressive formalism, reflecting the inner forces of nature and the human soul through a pictorially plastic form. K. Akhmetzhanov's canvases display the surrounding reality through pieces of color, "optically" collecting them into a picture of the world. In the works of A. Menlibayev, E. Ghazaryan there is a revival of interest in the folklore, ornamental style, taken from different temporal, spatial and cultural layers of history and traditions.[[File:Golden Man on top of the Independence Monument.jpg|alt=Golden Man on top of the Independence Monument|thumb|Golden Man on top of the Independence Monument]]Mythological symbolism is a significant phenomenon of modern art in Kazakhstan, which is expressed in the visual searches of artists Gulnara Kasmalieva's and Muratbek Djumaliev's "TransSiberian Amazons" (2005) and multi-channel video art "A New Silk Road: Algorithm of Survival and Hope” (2007), performance and photography of Victor and Elena Vorobievs “(Non)Silk Road” (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kudaibergenova|first=Diana T.|date=2017-01|title="My Silk Road to You": Re-imagining routes, roads, and geography in contemporary art of "Central Asia"|journal=Journal of Eurasian Studies|volume=8|issue=1|pages=31–43|doi=10.1016/j.euras.2016.11.007|issn=1879-3665}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Kazakhstan gained independence, there have been cardinal changes in all spheres: political, economic, social and art. One of the famous sculptural and architectural complexes of Modern Art is the Independence Monument in [[Almaty]] (sculptors A.Zhumabaev, N.Dalbai, architect Sh.Valihanov) and the monument to [[Ablai Khan|Ablaykhan]] in [[Astana]] (sculptor N. Dalbai, architect Sh. Valikhanov) made a considerable contribution to the approval of the idea of independence of Kazakhstan. The architectural-sculptural complex of the equestrian monument [[Isatay Taymanuly|Isatay Taimanov]] and [[Makhambet Otemisuly|Makhambet Utemisov]] in [[Atyrau]] (sculptor B.Abishev and E.Sergebaev) can be called a phenomenon of modern monumental sculpture of Kazakhstan. The square with the monument to [[Baibars|Sultan Beibars]] in Atyrau (sculptor K. Kakimov) became a beautiful laconic and expressive.

The Independence Monument, erected on the main square of Almaty, has become a symbol of the country, independence, a metaphor of the unity of the past, present and future of Kazakh history, culture and statehood. The granite stela directed upwards was crowned with a statue of a young warrior, stylized in the image of a famous "[[Issyk kurgan|Golden Man]]". At his feet is a formidable winged mythical leopard. Attention to the richest cultural heritage of the Kazakhs, its skillful transformation in new forms made the Monument of Independence a phenomenon of national scope and marked the beginning of a wide search in this direction. The Independence Monument, created by the team led by the architect Sh. Valihanov, is a large-scale and monumental, and at the same time syncretic, artistic genre. Accurate understanding of the laws of this genre, coupled with the inherent Sh. Valihanovu ability to synthesize ideas, the ability to organically link purely traditional, national elements with the achievements of world aesthetic and urban planning thought helped in the end to create a monument grandiose in design and embodiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">A '''Kunsthalle''' or '''Kunsthaus''' is a term in [[German language|German]]-speaking regions for a facility that mounts [[art exhibition]]s. The term roughly means "Art Gallery" in English but with a somewhat more specific meaning. A ''Kunsthalle'' is often operated by a non-profit ''Kunstverein'' ("Art Association") and a ''Kunsthaus'' ("Art House") refers more to a gallery or museum with associated artists, symposia, studios and workshops. A ''Kunsthalle'' is also similar to a ''Kunstmuseum'' ("Art Museum"), but the terms mean different things historically. In the strictest sense a ''Kunstmuseum'' has its own permanent collection and a ''Kunsthalle'' does not.

Today the boundaries between these terms are free flowing. In German-speaking countries there are many ''Kunstmuseum'' which are named ''Kunsthalle'' and vice versa. In addition, the activities of a traditional ''Kunsthaus'' are found in all forms of these art institutions.

The purpose of this list is to specifically list those exhibition venues, museums, and art societies which are officially named "Kunsthalle".

==Important dates in the history of art conservation==
Some key dates in the history of conservation in Europe and the United States include:
*1565, Restoration of the [[Sistine Chapel]] frescoes began [53 years after the ceilings were painted].
*1726, First attempt was made to restore Leonardo da Vinci's [[Last Supper]] by Michelangelo Bellotti.
*1729, First recorded transfer had been carried out by Domenico Michelini in Venice for a Titian painting (Ulisse Forni, Manuale del pittore restauratore, 1866, p.&amp;nbsp;106). The profession of restoration becomes more visible in the following years.  In the 18th century, painting restoration became a separate profession in France.
*1735 to 1820, Restoration of paintings in the Spanish royal collections following a 1734 fire.  Hundreds of important paintings were methodically treated in a specially constructed studio; materials used have been documented by Zahira Véliz.  (Zahira Véliz "The Restoration of Paintings in the Spanish Royal Collections, 1734-1820," Studies in the History of Painting Restoration, ed. Christine Sitwell and Sarah Staniforth, Archetype Publications, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–62.)
*1777, 1785, Pietro Edwards, Director of the Restoration of the Public Pictures of Venice and the Rialto, published on basic concepts of preventive conservation, original vices of painters’ materials, respect for the artist’s original intent, and reversibility.
*1794, Charles Willson Peale recorded in his memo book using wax to impregnate paintings.  By the middle of the 19th century, paintings were being wax lined; Rembrandt’s Night Watch was wax-lined in 1851. [Note precedent above with glue; first there was impregnation with an adhesive and some years later, lining.  Analogous to the 20th-century use of PVA/EVA etc.]
*1809, Count Chaptal of Napoleon’s court filed a report regarding pigments used in Pompeii. [Technical analysis of artists’ materials appears and increases in the 19th century.]
*1815, Pigment studies by Sir Humphry Davy (he had a small portable chemical laboratory and 	traveled around Europe, accompanied by Michael Faraday 1813-1815)
*1850, First U.S. Art Restoration Company was formed in New York City – Oliver Brothers Smitsonian Institution, James Oliver account books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/james-oliver-account-books-6971|title=Summary of the James Oliver account books, 1865-1890 - Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|author=Archives of American Art|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1851, Rembrandt’s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is relined with a wax adhesive.
*1852, The cleaning by John Seguier of nine major pictures in the National Gallery, London led to a fierce public outcry and demand for an inquiry.  Cleaning controversies followed in London, Paris, Munich, (in the US by 1978, and about the Sistine 	Chapel by 1985).  (Cleaning controversies had also erupted re. policies at the Louvre in 1793.)
*1850-1853, Michael Faraday carried out analytical and deterioration studies for the National Gallery, London, investigated varnishes, cleaning methods and the impact of London fog, coal smoke, and 	gas lighting on the discoloration of surface coatings.  His findings were generally ignored.
*1860s, [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration and Conservation]] has expanded and opened a location in Boston. 	
*1863, Max Pettenkofer of Munich patented a method to “reverse the aging of varnish” through exposure to ethanol vapors; this method was later found to increase the interactive zone between paintings and varnish, complicating future cleanings [Ref. Sibylle Schmitt, IIC 1990].
*1870s, Louis Pasteur carried out analytical studies of paint and optical crystallography for over a decade.
*1888, [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became chemist in charge of the Royal Museums of Berlin (Staatliche Museen), first museum laboratory
*1896, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered x-rays in 1895 and x-rayed a painting the next year.  He called them  “X-rays”, using the mathematical designation for something unknown.
*1920, [[British Museum]] Research Laboratory established under the direction of Alexander Scott as a direct response to the poor state of the museum’s collections.
*1920s, George T. Oliver of Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration, Boston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oliverbrothersonline.com|title=Art Restoration and Conservation - Oliver Brothers|work=Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration}}&lt;/ref&gt; has invented world’s first vacuum table for re-lining paintings.

*1974, [[Rutherford John Gettens]] died a week after making a presentation about the need for a conservation history project.  FAIC oral history project launched in 1975.  Over 239 transcribed interviews now available to researchers housed in the Winterthur Museum archives.
*1974, 1975, 1976, “Moratoria” on lining declared at conferences at Greenwich, UK; Venice (ICOM-CC 1975), and Ottawa (sponsored by the National Gallery, Canada).  Lining practices were reexamined and the regular lining of paintings as a preventive measure by practicing professional conservators decreased steadily. (NOTE: this occurred ca. two decades after the introduction of vacuum lining. A philosophy of “minimal intervention” gained increasing numbers of supporters in all specialties over the next three decades.
*1976, Research Center on the Materials of the Artist and Conservator at Carnegie Mellon University established, Dr. Robert L. Feller, Director.  Now “Art Conservation Research Center”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmu.edu/acrc/&lt;/ref&gt;

*1982, CAL, the “Conservation Analytical Laboratory” of the Smithsonian Institution, moved to Silver 	Hill, Maryland.  A three-year program for furniture conservation was sponsored there for a limited period of time; a new class was accepted only every three years, and classes were scheduled so that professional furniture conservators could participate in segments but keep their practices.

[[File:The Copper Cowboy living statue.jpg|thumb|"The Copper Cowboy", a living statue performer in [[Chicago]]]]
A '''living statue''' is a [[street artist]] who poses as a [[statue]] or [[mannequin]], usually with realistic statue-like [[makeup]], sometimes for hours at a time.

Living statue performers can fool passersby, and a number of [[hidden camera]] shows on [[television]] have used living statues to startle people.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} As with all performing arts, living statue performers may perform as [[busking|busker]]s.&lt;ref name="urlJob description: do as little as possible — Nordic Labour Journal"&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
[[File:Tableau vivant by Olga Desmond. 01.jpg|thumb|[[Olga Desmond]] nude with [[drapery]] and [[pedestal]]]]
The [[tableau vivant]], or group of living statues, was a regular feature of medieval and [[Renaissance]] festivities and pageantry, such as [[royal entries]] by rulers into cities. Typically a group enacting a scene would be mounted on an elaborate stand decorated to look like a monument, placed on the route of the procession. A living statue appeared in a scene of the 1945 French masterpiece film ''Les enfants du paradis'' (''[[Children of Paradise]]''), and early living statue pioneers include the London-based artists [[Gilbert and George]] in the 1960s. In the early years of the 20th century, the German dancer [[Olga Desmond]] put on “Evenings of Beauty” (Schönheitsabende) in which she posed nude in imitation of classical works of art ('living pictures').

Since 1996 the annual "World Statues Festival" is held in [[Arnhem]], [[Netherlands]], initially under the name "Rijnfestijn".

The [[:es:Universidad de Ciencias Empresariales y Sociales|University of Business and Social Sciences]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] has hosted a National Contest of Living Statues since the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucesarte.uces.edu.ar/ |title=Contest of Living Statues |publisher=Ucesarte.uces.edu.ar |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the International Festival of Living Statues has been hosted by Masca Theatre in Bucharest, Romania, where there is a focus on developing the form through artistic research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masca.ro/teatru/en/living-statues-international-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Busking==
Performing as a living statue is a prevalent form of [[busking]], especially in places with a high level of tourism. A living statue performer will strategically choose a spot, preferably one with a high level of foot traffic, and out of the way. The performer creates the illusion of complete stillness while standing. Sometimes, passers-by do not realize the performer is a real person, which often causes surprise when the 'statue' gives them a small gesture (such as a [[wink]] or [[nod (gesture)|nod]]). A busker's objective is to create moments of interaction that result in a tip. The amount of money a performer makes day to day depends on his or her ability to effectively interact with the crowd.

The '''''Madonna and Child with Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], dating to c. 1468-1469. It is now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]], in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was once attributed to [[Filippino Lippi]], master of Botticelli. The composition essentially derives from Botticelli's master (and [[Filippino Lippi]]'s father) [[Filippo Lippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The faces and other details suggest around the same period of the ''[[Fortitude (Botticelli)|Fortitude]]'' and the other juvenile Madonnas of the Italian painter. The composition is similar to [[Verrocchio]]'s ''[[The Virgin and Child with Two Angels (Andrea del Verrochio)|Madonna of the Milk]]'', probably dating to a year or two earlier.

'''Magnet Hill''' is a "Cyclops [[gravity hill|hill]]" located near [[Leh|Leh]] in [[Ladakh]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eureka4you.com/magnetichillworldwide/Leh-JK.htm|title=Magnetic Hill Leh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir|access-date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the appearance of a hill. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOTHING MAGNETIC ABOUT MAGNETIC HILL|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/others/sci-tech/Nothing-magnetic-about-Magnetic-Hill/articleshow/48299466.cms|date=31 July 2015|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other two such magnetic hills are in [[Gujarat]]. One is near [[Bhuj]] ([[Kalo Dungar|Kalo dungar]] - the black hills) and other at [[Tulsishyam|Tulsi Shyam]].

'''Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts''' is a database of [[Latter-day Saint]] media and creators. It contains entries on film, music, and writings, as well as directors, composers, and writers. It is "an important critical resource that seeks to comprehensively list literary writings and associated artistic works by and about Mormons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mormonletters.org/?p=960 |title=Mormon LitCrit: Help Us Get It Right? |first=Chris |last=Bigelow |work=Dawning of a Brighter Day |publisher=[[Association for Mormon Letters]] |date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidenced by its name, it launched as a catalogue of Mormon authors and literature in the mid-1990s by Gideon Burton, a [[BYU]] English professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mormonlit.lib.byu.edu/html/credits.html |title=Mormon Literature Database – Credits and History |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further expanded as a [[relational database]] called the '''Mormon Literature Database''' in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcing the Mormon Literature Database |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume=36 |number=2 |date=Summer 2003 |pages=231–233 |url=http://dialoguejournal.metapress.com/app/home/content.asp?referrer=contribution&amp;format=2&amp;page=1&amp;pagecount=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was expanded to include other forms of media, and was newly christened Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts (MLCA). It is currently sponsored by BYU's [[Harold B. Lee Library]].

The '''National Youth Music Theatre''' ('''NYMT''') is an arts organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] providing pre-professional education and [[musical theatre]] stage experience for young people. Based in London, it is constituted as a [[private limited company]] (originally named '''Children's Music Theatre Limited''') and as a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]. NYMT was founded in 1976 by director and playwright Jeremy James Taylor. Since its inception, it has produced over fifty productions at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], premièred thirty new musical theatre works, toured several times outside the United Kingdom, and had runs in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Amongst the many alumni of the National Youth Music Theatre who have gone on to careers in the performing arts are [[Jude Law]] (one of its patrons), [[Jonny Lee Miller]], Sheridan Smith, Connie Fisher, Idris Elba and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]]. Alumni have also included directors such as Jo Davies, and songwriters such as Tara Mcdonald.

==Activities==
The NYMT's primary activity is the education of young people in theatre production and performance. It produces and commissions [[musical theatre]] works in which young people between the ages of 11 and 23 perform as actors, musicians, and stage crew under the guidance of theatre professionals. The company tours both in the UK and abroad performing established musicals such as ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'' and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'',&lt;ref name = "Playbill"&gt;Webb, Paul (23 April 2003).

==History==

===1976 to 2003===
The NYMT had its beginnings in 1976, when its founder Jeremy James Taylor, produced ''The Ballad of Salomon Pavey'' in a tent on the lawn of [[Mill Hill School#Management|Belmont School]] in [[Mill Hill]], North London. The musical, performed by twenty boys at the school, was based on the life of the 17th century [[Boy player|boy actor]], Salomon Pavey, with a book by Taylor and David Drew-Smythe.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to Musical Theatre. [http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_b/balladsalomonpavey.htm ''The Ballad of Saloman Pavey'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor then took the production to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] where it won a [[The Scotsman|Scotsman]] Fringe First award.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Gregory (20 April 1977). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19770420&amp;id=5acrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AP0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7192,3700243 "12-Year-Old Actors Hit in London"].

Retrieved 20 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe in other musicals performed entirely by school children followed in succeeding years with ''Helen Come Home, or Achilles the Heel'' (1978) and ''Tin Pan Ali, or The Sesame Street Racket'' (1979). The company became known as the Children's Musical Theatre and in 1980 was registered as a [[private limited company]] and as a [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=281159&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Registered Charity no. 281159] at the [[Charity Commission of England and Wales]]. Retrieved 16 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 it changed its name to the National Youth Music Theatre and began holding residential workshops in addition to its summer productions.

In 1986, ''The Ragged Child'' by David Nield, Frank Whately and Taylor, along with ''[[Let's Make an Opera]]'', was performed on the Edinburgh International Festival. ''The Ragged Child'' went on to Sadler's Wells in Spring 1987 and was filmed for BBC TV a year later. It became one of the company's flagship productions. With its 1998 production of ''The Ragged Child'', the NYMT also became the first touring company to perform at the new [[Glyndebourne|Glyndebourne opera house]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' (23 October 1998).

''Pendragon'' by Peter Allwood, Frank Whately, Joanna Horton and Jeremy James Taylor won a [[Scotsman Fringe First Award]] in 1994, followed by a tour to the Far East and then a week at the [[New York City Center]] where it was given the accolade of ''[[New York Times]]''  ''Critics' Choice''.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, Lawrence (27 October 1995).

===Financial crisis===
Over the years, the NYMT's main funding had come from private sponsorship, initially from the [[Nationwide Building Society]] and then from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], as well as grants from the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] and [[Arts Council England]]. When Lloyd Webber's sponsorship ended in 1999, the company's financial position became increasingly precarious. By early 2002, it was operating at a deficit and facing the threat of closure.&lt;ref&gt;[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport (30 March 2005) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmcumeds/254/2543we03.htm "Arts Development – Musical Theatre"].

===Relaunch – 2005 to the present===
In October 2005, with its debts cleared, the company announced a relaunch with a Royal Charity Gala, attended by the NYMT's president, the [[Earl of Wessex]].

'''''Northern River''''' is a 1914–15 [[oil painting]] by Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]]. The work was inspired by a sketch completed over the same winter, possibly in [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]]. The completed canvas is large, measuring 115.1 × 102.0 cm (45&lt;small&gt;{{frac|5|16}}&lt;/small&gt; × 40&lt;small&gt;{{frac|3|16}}&lt;/small&gt; in). Painted over the winter of 1914–15, it was completed in Thomson's shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in [[Toronto]]. The painting was produced as he was entering the peak of his short art career and is considered one of his most notable works. In 1915 it was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] and has remained in the collection ever since.

''Northern River'' and the winter of 1914–15 stand as a point of transition in Thomson's art. In 1914 he made himself a sketch box to hold 8½ × 10½ inch (21.6 × 26.7&amp;nbsp;cm) panels,{{sfnb|Davies|c. 1930}} allowing him greater opportunity for sketching.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}} [[A. Y. Jackson]] in particular taught him about the subtleties of composition, colour and technique in general,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}} allowing the sketches that followed show a beginning desire to experiment with colour and texture rather than continue with the precision and subdued nature of his earlier works.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=127, 133}}

==Description==

[[File:Tom Thomson The Pool.jpg|thumb|''The Pool'', Winter 1915–16. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]

In a letter to [[James MacCallum]], Thomson referred to ''Northern River'' as his "swamp picture."{{sfnb|Thomson|1915}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/northern-river 26]}}{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=110}}{{efn|group=note|Thomson would specifically write, {{quote|[...]

I hear that my swamp picture is down at [[Ottawa]] on appro. Hope they keep it.

Yours truly / Tom Thomson{{sfnb|Thomson|1915}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002|p=300}}}}}} Though Thomson was typically critical of his own work, he described the painting as being "not half bad" to a nephew.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=46}} [[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]], a Canadian artist and critic, praised the painting, writing in a letter,

{{quote|Just plain impossible, but he has done it, it stirs you. Any painter who has ever worked on this overlying pattern motive will realize at once that this is tackling a complication beyond reason. A great point in Thomson's favour this, and his lack of perfection. I am wary of craftsmanship. It is nothing in itself, neither emotion nor creation. [...] I rather think it would have been wiser to have taken your ten most prominent Canadians and sunk them in [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]]—and saved Tom Thomson.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/northern-river 26]}}{{sfnb|Milne|1932}}}}

In an article for ''[[Canadian Magazine]]'', MacCallumm would write about the uniqueness of the painting amongst Thomson's entire catalogue. In particular, while Thomson would normally depict trees as amalgamated masses, in this painting he gives them each an individual form: {{quote|Drawing was to [Thomson] the expression of form, and form might be expressed by any method, so long as the form is true. One would have expected that with his intimate knowledge of trees he would have loved to paint all their traceries. In the “Northern River” alone did he lavish detail on his trees and here only because it helped the pattern. In one in whom the sense of design, of decoration was so developed that is the more striking, for in his sketches and in his larger pictures he always treated trees as masses. In his painting of them he gives form structure and colour by dragging paint in bold strokes over an underlying tone. Like many other painters he felt the limitations of paint, the impossibility of expressing on a flat surface the solidity and thickness of a tree, and in some canvasses almost modeled them in paint, while in others he got the same effect by expressing them by deep grooves in the paint.{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|pp=379–80}}}}

The painting recalls elements of A. Y. Jackson's 1914 canvas, ''A Frozen Lake'',{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=130}} which Thomson likely saw in November 1914 before Jackson took it in December to be exhibited.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 130 n. 107}} Both paintings share a motif of trees and thin, sinuous branches obscuring the view to a body of water.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=130}} The directional emphasis of the image is placed in the vertical direction, especially apparent when contrasted with the later canvas, ''The Pool''.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=70}}

Given Thomson's love of poetry,{{sfnb|Murray|1999|pp=viii, 12}} the title of the work may be a reference to the [[William Wilfred Campbell]] poem, ''A Northern River''. Campbell was a Canadian poet who lived in [[Owen Sound]], nearby to Thomson's hometown of [[Leith, Ontario|Leith]].{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=46}}

It is not known where the original study was made. Though it is typically assumed to have been completed in Algonquin Park, Thomson's friend Winifred Trainor claimed that it was set outside the Park.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=46}} Curator Charles Hill has instead suggested that the sketch was "[p]robably painted in his Toronto studio, it is most likely a memory—an amalgam of experiences rather than a specific site."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=130}}

The initial sketch of the scene illustrates Thomson's adept ability to transform his small sketches into powerful studio paintings.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–85}} This is apparent with other sketch-painting pairings, such as ''[[:File:Tom Thomson, Opulent October.jpg|Opulent October]]'', ''[[Spring Ice]]'', ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'', amongst many other examples.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/northern-river 26]}} Thomson's first [[gouache]] study of the work was brightly coloured partly because gouache reflects more light than oil on canvas does. To make the eventual studio painting livelier, he included reds, oranges and yellows within the foreground, though still maintaining the original gouache blends in the sky.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/northern-river 26]}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=130}} The dominant colour of the painting is black, an oddity within Thomson's corpus.{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=110}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=130}} Curator and scholar Joan Murray has written that the final canvas closely follows the original study, but with key differences. For one, the canvas is devoid of the accidental brushstrokes present in the sketch. Foreground space was also added to better convey depth and the trees are simpler and more defined, with less foliage present.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=46}}

===Art Nouveau===
{{see also|Art Nouveau}}
In Thomson's time as a commercial artist, he became familiar with the then contemporary decorative style of [[Art Nouveau]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=94, 210}}{{sfnb|Reid|2002|pp=65–83}} [[Art history|Art historian]] David P. Silcox has described ''Northern River'' as utilizing the same sinuous forms that are to be found in the art style.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/the-west-wind 47], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}} Of particular note are the "S-curves" of the trees which have their origins in Thomson's work as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=60}} He would continue to utilize this motif in other later works, such as ''Decorative Landscape, Birches'' (1915–16) and ''The West Wind'' (1916–17).{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=59–60}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}} Fellow artist [[A. Y. Jackson]] would affirm the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]'s tendency towards using Art Nouveau styles within their work, writing that, "We (the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson) treated our subjects with the freedom of designers. We tried to emphasize colour, line and pattern."{{sfnb|McKay|2011|p=185}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}}

==Provenance and exhibition==
The [[National Gallery of Canada]] purchased the painting from Thomson in 1915 for $500 ({{Inflation|CA|500|1914|fmt=eq|r=-3|cursign=[[Canadian Dollar|CAD$]]}}),{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=209}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#a-startling-debut 13], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#thomson-and-the-art-market 65]}} essentially a years wage for a painter like himself.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/northern-river 26]}} Since then, it has appeared in over 30 exhibitions, including shows at [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Musée &amp; du Jeu de Paume]] in [[Paris]]; [[Los Angeles]]; [[London]]; and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern River, Winter 1914–15 (1914–1915.11)|url=http://tomthomsoncatalogue.org/catalogue/entry.php?id=278|website=tomthomsoncatalogue.org|publisher=Tom Thomson Catalgoue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three movements are based in the [[Sonata form]], while the harmonic language reflects [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] [[Basque music|folk music]] through the use of altered thirds and sevenths in a major tonality.

A '''resistant reading''' is a reading of a text which moves beyond the dominant cultural beliefs to challenge prevailing views. It means to read a text as it was not meant to be read; in fact reading the text against itself.

==Textual example==
By way of illustration, consider [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem [[To His Coy Mistress]].

A resistant reading may develop from an alternative reading, pointing out how the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[gender]] in the poem furthers the notion of gender as [[binary opposition]]s, the male is active and powerful, the female is passive and marginalized. As such, it will be read by readers who share [[feminist]] views of the world as [[gender inequality]] and discrimination against women. For example, Marvell's representation of [[heterosexuality]] in the poem may be read as being exploitative, based as it is on the persona psychologically terrorizing the woman. Marvell depicts his persona as attempting to have the woman submit as a result of the fear he seeks to instill within her; Marvell's vivid and confronting [[image]]ry is most significant and not accidental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound / My echoing song: then worms shall try / That long preserved [[virginity]]...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Importance==
Resistant reading is an important element of our critical and interpretive repertoire. It is worth considering whether [[diegesis|diegetic]] border crossing always strengthens the potential for resistant reading (as might seem intuitively likely, given that readers are moving in and out of the story), or whether on some occasions it might trigger the reverse effect.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Literacy Research,  Spring 2003  by Mackey, Margaret&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rory Goes to Holyrood''''' is a 2013 satirical documentary presented by Scottish impressionist and comedian [[Rory Bremner]]. Aired by [[BBC Two Scotland]] on 13 June 2013, the hour-long programme takes a satirical look at [[Scottish politics]] and the [[Scottish independence|independence]] debate, two subjects that had largely seen an absence of humour up to that point. The film sees Bremner visit the [[Scottish Parliament]] and interview politicians and other senior public figures as he gets to grips with the issues of the Scottish political scene. Bremner recorded the programme after moving back to live in Scotland and realising he knew very little about the politics of that country.

==Background==

Details of the programme were announced by the BBC Media Centre in March 2013, with plans for it to be aired later in the year. Bremner had recently returned to live in Scotland after spending much of his life in England, and as part of the press release for the show, he gave some insight into his reasons for recording it. "Coming back to Scotland in the run-up to the Referendum, I realised I knew almost nothing about Scottish Politics. Time I did. And why is there so little political comedy in Scotland outside the Parliament? Time to make sense (and nonsense) of it all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/rory-goes-to-holyrood.html |work=BBC Media Centre |title=Rory Bremner puts Scottish politics under satirical spotlight |publisher=BBC |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 also saw Bremner defend fellow comedian [[Susan Calman]], whose attempt to satirise the referendum debate on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The News Quiz]]'' led to her receiving death threats on social media from [[Cybernat|users]] who had been offended by her comments.&lt;ref name=Record-2013-06-10&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=English |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scots-comic-rory-bremner-says-1944212 |title=Scots comic Rory Bremner says most voters don't know who to vote for |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Daily Record |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12/&gt; Bremner himself spoke of a strong reaction to the announcement of his show, telling ''[[The Scotsman]]'' in June 2013 "I didn't get it to the extent that Susan Calman did, but the strength of feeling surprised me."&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudden |first=Liam |url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/tv-radio/rory-bremner-talks-scottish-politics-in-rory-goes-to-holyrood-1-2963333 |title=Rory Bremner talks Scottish politics in Rory Goes To Holyrood |publisher=Johnston Press |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that from a comedy perspective, there are people who "think [First Minister] Alex Salmond should be off limits, even though Alex Salmond himself has a very good sense of humour and understands that political comedians are part of a healthy democracy."&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12/&gt; ''The Scotsman'' later noted that "many observers have complained of a lack of satire in the mainstream media and lamented the fact even light-hearted attempts to lampoon the Scottish political scene have triggered an explosion of online bile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/tv-radio/scottish-independence-rory-bremner-in-comedy-call-1-3249299 |title=Scottish independence: Rory Bremner in comedy call |publisher=Johnston Press |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=28 December 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme aired on BBC Two Scotland on 13 June 2013.&lt;ref name=Record-2013-06-10/&gt; Shortly before it was broadcast, Bremner said that recording it had left him undecided on the question of Scottish independence. "On the debate itself, I started the programme with an open mind and, funnily enough, ended it with a perhaps more open mind."&lt;ref name=Scotsman-2013-06-12/&gt; He subsequently called for there to be more satire in the referendum debate. "There’s great humour to be had. There’s a lot of big, different characters involved and good arguments, and there are plenty of good Scottish comedians who can have plenty of fun with it. It’s far too dangerous to leave it only to the politically minded."

==Synopsis==

The programme follows Bremner{{mdash}}known for his impressions of UK politicians{{mdash}}as he searches for material to put together a show focusing on Scottish politics for the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], the first time he has tackled the subject. Speaking to politicians, journalists and other public figures, he seeks to get to grips with Scotland's political scene, as well as the issues surrounding the independence debate, also assembling a team of his fellow comedians to help. The group, including [[Andy Zaltzman]], Julia Sutherland and Paul Sneddon, discusses potential material with Bremner, and identifies characteristics and topics that could be used in a stand-up routine. Sheldon says that one of the problems with putting together such a show is that many people cannot identify the key figures at Holyrood, something highlighted by Bremner himself during a street survey in which he asks members of the public to name Scotland's politicians.

Undaunted by the lack of public recognition of those he intends to lampoon, Bremner works on his material, listening to recordings of [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] and other politicians as he drives between appointments. He is given a tour of the [[Scottish Parliament Building]] by MSP [[Joan McAlpine]] and watches a session of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. He also travels to Westminster to interview [[Ian Davidson (British politician)|Ian Davidson]], chair of the [[Scottish Affairs Select Committee]]. The documentary ends with Brember presenting a one-off stand-up routine at Edinburgh's [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]].

The '''[[salamander]]''' is an [[amphibian]] of the order [[Salamander|Urodela]] which, as with many real creatures, often has been ascribed fantastic and sometimes [[occult]] qualities by pre-modern authors (as in the allegorical descriptions of animals in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[bestiary|bestiaries]]) not possessed by the real organism. The legendary salamander is often depicted as a typical salamander in shape, with a [[lizard]]-like form, but is usually ascribed an affinity with [[fire]], sometimes specifically [[Fire (classical element)|elemental fire]].

==Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance lore==
This legendary creature embodies the fantastic qualities that ancient and medieval commentators ascribed to the natural [[salamander]]. Many of these qualities are rooted in verifiable traits of the natural creature but often exaggerated. A large body of [[legend]], [[mythology]], and [[symbol]]ism has developed around this creature over the centuries.

===Classical lore: Pliny, the Talmud, and Augustine===
In one of the earliest surviving descriptions of a salamander, [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 CE) noted that the creature is ''"an animal like a lizard in shape and with a body specked all over; it never comes out except during heavy showers and goes away the moment the weather becomes clear."''&lt;ref&gt;"sicut salamandrae, animal lacertae figura, stellatum, numquam nisi magnis imbribus proveniens et serenitate desinens"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]], eds., London: Taylor and Francis, 1855. Translation slightly modified.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these traits, even down to the star-like markings, are consistent with the [[Salamandra atra aurorae|golden Alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra aurorae'') of Europe that has golden or yellow spots or blotches on its back&lt;ref name="van der Meijden"&gt;*{{cite web |url=http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/amphib_query?table=amphib&amp;special=one_record&amp;where-genus=Salamandra&amp;where-species=atra |title=AmphibiaWeb: ''Salamandra atra'' |author=Arie van der Meijden |date=1999-12-30 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some similarly marked subspecies of the [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'').&lt;ref name="Kuzmin"&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/amphib_query?table=amphib&amp;special=one_record&amp;where-genus=Salamandra&amp;where-species=salamandra|title=AmphibiaWeb: ''Salamandra salamandra''|author=Sergius L. Kuzmin|date=1999-10-06}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny even made the important distinction between salamanders and lizards, which are similar in shape but different in other respects, which was not systematized until modern times, when [[Biology|biologists]] [[Scientific classification|classified]] lizards as [[reptile]]s and salamanders as amphibians.

Pliny recounts several other traits which are less credible, such as the ability to extinguish fire with the frigidity of their bodies, a quality which was reported as hearsay by [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Ch. XVII, Sec. 13 in the Cresswell translation&lt;/ref&gt; While Pliny notes this in Book 10, Chapter 86 of the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', in Book 29, Chapter 23 of the same work he views this idea with skepticism, pointing out that if such an idea were true, it should be easy to demonstrate.

Pliny also notes medicinal and poisonous properties, which are founded in fact on some level, since many species of salamander, including fire salamanders and Alpine salamanders, excrete toxic, physiologically active substances. These substances are often excreted when the animal is threatened, which has the effect of deterring predators.&lt;ref name="van der Meijden" /&gt; The extent of these properties is greatly exaggerated though, with a single salamander being regarded as so toxic that by twining around a tree it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well could slay all who drank from it.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book | author=White, T. H. |authorlink=T. H.

The salamander is also mentioned in the [[Talmud]] (Hagiga 27a) as a creature that is a product of fire, and it relates that anyone who is smeared with its blood will be immune to harm from fire. [[Rashi]] (1040–1105), the primary commentator on the Talmud, describes the salamander as one which is produced by burning a fire in the same place for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://independent.academia.edu/RudolphKlein/Papers/1223468/Salamandra_and_the_Flames_of_Hell Salamandra and the Flames of Hell]" by Reb Chaim HaQoton&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Saint Augustine]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' used the example of salamanders to argue for the possibility of humans being punished by being burned in eternal flame in [[Purgatory]]. He wrote "If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|page=454 (Book 21, Ch. 4)|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102|author=Augustine of Hippo|editor=Philip Schaff|language=English, Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy,'' (original publisher unclear-see [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/] for on-line text), (1928).&lt;/ref&gt; This illustration appears to originate in a 1527 anti-papal tract by [[Andreas Osiander]] and [[Hans Sachs]], where it is identified as "the Pope as a monster".&lt;ref&gt;Renate Freitag-Stadler and Erhard Schön, ''Die Welt des Hans Sachs,'' City History Museum of Nuremberg, 1976, p. 24 (Kat. 25/15)&lt;/ref&gt; Its association with Paracelsus derives from his ''Auslegung der Magischen Figuren im Carthäuser Kloster zu Nũrnberg''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hohenheim (Paracelsus)|first=Theophrastus|title=Bücher und Schriften: Adiunctus est Index rerum et verborum accuratiß.

Catholic Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer (1862–1945) explained that the set of woodcuts it belongs to was commissioned by Osiander based on some old "pope illustrations" found at the monastery, which Netzhammer thought may have dated back to the time of [[Joachim of Fiore]] (d. 1202) and were intended as cartoons mocking the Pope and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Netzhammer|first=Raymund|title=Theophrastus Paracelsus: das wissenswerteste über leben, lehre und schriften des berühmten Einsiedler arztes|date=1900|publisher=Benziger|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aP0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA4&amp;pg=RA1-PA4#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of the legendary form are more likely to use stylized depictions. In Medieval European bestiaries, fanciful depictions of salamanders include "a satyr-like creature in a circular wooden tub" (8th century), "a worm penetrating flames" (12th century), "a winged dog" (13th century), and "a small bird in flames" (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;Florence McCulloch, ''Medieval Latin and French Bestiaries'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962, pp.161–162&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Renaissance lore: Europe===
[[File:Salamander cartouche of Francois 1 at Azay-le-Rideau.jpg|thumb|Salamander as the animal emblem of King [[Francis I of France]] at the [[Château d'Azay-le-Rideau]], Vienne, France]]

Compared to Medieval depictions, [[Renaissance]] depictions&lt;ref name="prod"&gt;[http://www.propheties.it/nostradamus/prodigiorum/prodigiorum1.html Conrad Lycosthenes, ''Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon,'' 1557] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105012/http://www.propheties.it/nostradamus/prodigiorum/prodigiorum1.html |date=2007-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are characteristically more realistic, adhering more closely to the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] description. In another example, a 1556 edition of the ''Book of Lambspring'' depicts the salamander as a white bird,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Lambspring|url=http://www.compendiumnaturalis.net/the-book-of-lambspring-1556/|website=Compendium Naturalis|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lucas Jennis]]' 1625 version of the same illustration, included in the ''[[Musaeum Hermeticum]]'', depicts it as a lizard-like animal with star-like markings (see right).

Of all the traits ascribed to salamanders, the ones relating to fire have stood out most prominently. This connection probably originates from a behavior common to many species of salamander: hibernating in and under rotting logs. When wood was brought indoors and put on the fire, the creatures "mysteriously" appeared from the flames. The 16th-century Italian artist [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571) famously recalled witnessing just such an appearance as a child in his autobiography.&lt;ref name="bullfinch"&gt;[[Thomas Bulfinch]] (1913). ''Age of Fable: Vols. I &amp; II: Stories of Gods and Heroes'': [http://www.bartleby.com/181/365.html XXXVI. e. The Salamander]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some writers, the milky substance that a salamander exudes when frightened and which makes its skin moist gave rise to the idea that the salamander could withstand any heat and even put out fires.&lt;ref name="bullfinch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="friar"&gt;{{cite book | author=Friar, Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Friar |title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry |year=1987 |pages= 300 |publisher=Alphabooks/[[A &amp; C Black]]
|location=London |isbn=978-0-906670-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea which is found in several Medieval and Renaissance works was that "Egyptian priests" used a [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] which applied the figure of a salamander to represent a man who is burnt, or in other versions a man who has died from cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hieroglyphes.over-blog.com/article-33035010.html |title=Question : Salamandre et hiéroglyphes ? |author=Eric Desrentes |work=hieroglyphes.over-blog.com/ |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=2 September 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is first found in the ''Hieroglyphica'' of [[Horapollo]] (Book 2, Ch. LXII), but it is not now considered to be an authentic representation of hieroglyphic usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Browne|first=Thomas|title=Pseudodoxia Epidemica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo314.html#note1|accessdate=1 March 2014|author2=James Eason |page=314 (note 1)|date=1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early commentators in Europe often grouped "crawling things" (''reptiles'' or ''reptilia'' in Latin) together, and thus creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin ''salamandrae''), [[European dragon|dragons]] (Latin ''dracones'' or ''serpentes''), and [[basilisk]]s (Latin ''basilisci''), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' ''Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon'' of 1557.&lt;ref name="prod"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) wrote the following on the salamander: ''"This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in which it constantly renews its scaly skin. The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,—for virtue."''&lt;ref&gt;''Book XX: Humorous Writings'', ''The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci'', edited by Jean Paul Richter, 1880. ([http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo/section-20/item-1236.html online]) (unconfirmed)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) suggested that the salamander was the [[elemental]] of [[fire (classical element)|fire]],&lt;ref name=Paracelsus&gt;Theophrast von Hohenheim a.k.a. Paracelsus, ''Sämtliche Werke: Abt. 1, v. 14, sec. 7, Liber de nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris et de caeteris spiritibus.'' [[Karl Sudhoff]] and Wilh. Matthießen, eds. Munich:Oldenbourg, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; which has had substantial influence on the role of salamanders in the occult. Paracelsus, contrary to the prevalent view of the time, considered them to be not devils but similar to humans — only lacking souls (along with giants, dwarves, mermaids, elves, and elemental spirits in human form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Treatises of Theophrastus Von Hohenheim Called Paracelsus |date=1941 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |page=221 ff |author=Paracelsus |editor1=Sigerist, H.E |editor2=Temkin, C.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis I of France]] used the salamander as his symbol.

The salamander is found throughout French folklore, although in differing form. In addition or sometimes instead of its fire symbolism, it was attributed a powerful poison. Some legends say that merely by falling into a well, it would poison the water, and by climbing a fruit tree, poison the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Les animaux du Moyen Âge réels et mythiques | publisher = Autres temps | author = Josy Marty-Dufaut| year = 2005 | isbn = 978-2845211650|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highly toxic breath was reportedly enough to swell a person until their skin broke; in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], it supposedly did the same to herds of cattle. This gained it the name of "bellows breath". Like the real animal, the legendary salamander breathed seldom; unlike the real salamander, the only way to kill one was said to be to lock it in a confined space so that it breathed its own poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Brasey, Édouard |  title=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux| publisher=[[Éditions le pré aux clercs]] | place=Paris | date =14 September 2007 | pages=161–162| isbn=978-2842283216|  title-link=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bretons feared it so they did not dare say its real name for fear it would hear and then kill them.

===Renaissance: Asian garments===
Early travelers to [[China]] were shown garments supposedly woven from salamander hair or wool; the cloth was completely unharmed by fire. The garments had actually been [[weaving|woven]] from [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name="bullfinch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clare Browne, "Salamander's Wool: The Historical Evidence for Textiles Woven with Asbestos Fibre", ''[[Textile History]]'', Volume 34, Number 1, May 2003, pp. 64–73(10) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/tex/2003/00000034/00000001/art00008 (abstract)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to T. H. White, [[Prester John]] had a robe made from it; the "Emperor of India" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; and [[Pope Alexander III]] had a tunic which he valued highly.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; [[William Caxton]] (1481) wrote: ''"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre."''&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; 
Holme (1688) wrote: ''"...I have several times put [salamander hair] in the Fire and made it red hot and after taken it out, which being cold, yet remained perfect wool."''&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;&lt;ref name="friar"/&gt;

An alternative interpretation was that this material was a kind of [[silk]]: A 12th-century letter supposedly from Prester John says, ''"Our realm yields the worm known as the salamander. Salamanders live in fire and make [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]], which our court ladies spin and use to weave cloth and garments. To wash and clean these fabrics, they throw them into flames."''&lt;ref name="borges"&gt;{{cite book | author=Borges, Jorge Luis
|authorlink=Jorge Luis Borges |title=El libro de los seres imaginarios (The Book of Imaginary Beings) 
|year=1969|origyear= 1967; English language edition 1969 | page= |title-link=The Book of Imaginary Beings }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friar also notes that [[Marco Polo]] believed that the "true" salamander was an incombustible substance found in the earth.&lt;ref name="friar" /&gt;

==Newts in witchcraft==
A [[newt]] is a type of salamander, and they are traditionally associated with [[witchcraft]]. In [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play ''[[Macbeth]]'', the [[Three Witches|witches]] use the "eye of newt" as the first ingredient stirred in their [[cauldron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eye of Newt and Toe of Frog, Adder's Fork and Lizard's Leg: The Lore and Mythology of Amphibians and Reptiles|last=Crump|first=Marty|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780226116006|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENYpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the famous line in ''Macbeth'' is actually referring to a series of plants. Eye of newt refers to mustard, which reiterates the link between salamanders and fire as mustard seeds are used as a "fiery" spice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/is-eye-of-newt-real-thing.htm|title=Is eye of newt a real thing?|author=|date=13 July 2015|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' or the '''Tomb of the Unknowns''' is a monument dedicated to U.S. service members who have died without their remains being identified. It is located in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Virginia]], United States of America. The World War I "Unknown" is a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]], the [[Victoria Cross]], and several other foreign nations' highest service awards. The U.S. Unknowns who were interred are also recipients of the Medal of Honor, presented by [[U.S. Presidents]] who presided over their funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/VisitorInformation/TombofUnknowns.aspx |title=Arlington National Cemetery: The Tomb of the Unknowns |publisher=Arlingtoncemetery.mil |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061022000402/http://www.medalofhonor.com/WorldWarIUnknown.htm Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients - World War I Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] (archived from [http://www.medalofhonor.com/WorldWarIUnknown.htm the original] on October 22, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wwi-unk.htm World War I Unknown Soldier], Arlington National Cemetery website.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument has no officially designated name.

[[File:TombOfTheUnknownSoldier11-11-1922.jpg|thumb|Tomb as of November 11, 1922. The Tomb of 1931 would occupy this same location.]]
On March 4, 1921, the [[United States Congress]] approved the burial of an unidentified American serviceman from World War I in the plaza of the new [[Memorial Amphitheater]]. On November 11, 1921, the unknown soldier brought back from France was interred below a three-level marble tomb. The bottom two levels are six marble sections each and the top at least nine blocks with a rectangular opening in the center of each level through which the unknown remains were placed through the tomb and into the ground below. A stone, rather than marble, slab covers the rectangular opening.&lt;ref name="Quartermaster1963"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qmfound.com/tomb_of_the_unknown_soldier.htm|title=The Quartermaster Review September – October 1963|publisher=[[United States Army]]|accessdate=November 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206213358/http://www.qmfound.com/tomb_of_the_unknown_soldier.htm|archive-date=2011-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/npc2008008052|title=Configuration of 1921 Tomb|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World War I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch1.htm|title=The Unknown Soldier of World War I|work=The Last Salute: Civil and Military Funeral, 1921-1969|publisher=[[United States Army]]|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1921 the intent was to place a superstructure on top of the Tomb, but it was not until July 3, 1926, that Congress authorized the completion of the Tomb and the expenditure of $50,000 (with a completed cost of $48,000). A design competition was held and won by architect [[Lorimer Rich]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Syracuse University Archives has an extensive collection of Lorimer Rich (1914 Syracuse graduate) papers pertaining to his architect design work of the Tomb, including 44 numbered drawings of the Tomb. http://archives.syr.edu/collections/alumni/rich_box.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218084751/http://archives.syr.edu/collections/alumni/rich_box.html |date=February 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sculptor [[Thomas Hudson Jones]]. An appropriation from Congress for the work was secured and on December 21, 1929, a contract for completion of the Tomb itself was entered into. The Tomb would consist of seven pieces of marble in four levels (cap, die, base and sub-base) of which the die is the largest block with the sculpting on all four sides.&lt;ref name="Quartermaster1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TGHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tombguard.org/tombblue.html |publisher=Society of the Honor Guard Tomb of the Unknown Soldier |title=History of the Tomb |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116035851/http://www.tombguard.org/tombblue.html |archivedate=November 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quarrying the [[Yule marble]] (3.9 miles south of [[Marble, Colorado]] by the Vermont Marble Company) was a one-year process beginning in 1930. The cap was quarried on the first attempt but the base required three tries. The large middle block also required three tries. In late January 1931, the 56 ton middle block was lifted out of the quarry. The quarrying involved 75 men. When the block was separated from the mountain inside the quarry it weighed 124 tons. A wire saw was then brought into the quarry to cut the block down to 56 tons.

On February 3, the block reached the marble mill site (in the town of Marble) after a four-day trip from the quarry. Here it was crated, then shipped to Vermont on February 8. The block was sawn to final size in West Rutland, Vermont, and fabricated by craftsmen in [[Proctor, Vermont]], before it was shipped by train to Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.&lt;ref name="CityStone"&gt;"Marble, Colorado: City of Stone"; by Duane Vandenbusche and Rex Myers; Golden Bell Press; Denver, Colorado; 6th printing February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; By September, all 7 blocks were on the grounds of the Tomb site, at Arlington.

Assembly began in September 1931. An imperfection was found in the base, requiring three more quarryings. By the end of December 1931, the assembly was completed. Finishing work followed with the carvings on the die block by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]] under the direction of the sculptor Thomas Jones.&lt;ref name="Quartermaster1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MemoryStone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vermont-marble.com/blog/2010/02/ |publisher=Vermont Marble Company |title=The Vermont Marble Museum |date=April 1931 |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227044536/http://vermont-marble.com/blog/2010/02/ |archivedate=December 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The brothers also carved the Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial).

The Tomb&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Many sources reference the 1931 Tomb as a sarcophagus, but it is not: in a [[sarcophagus]], the remains are placed in a hollowed-out portion of the stone; the marble in the Tomb was not hollowed out and the remains are underneath the Tomb.&lt;/ref&gt; was placed at the head of the grave of the World War I Unknown. West of this grave are the crypts of Unknowns from World War II (south) and [[Korean War|Korea]] (north). Between the two lies a crypt that once contained an Unknown from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] (middle). His remains were positively identified in 1998 through DNA testing as First Lieutenant [[Michael Blassie]], United States Air Force and were removed. Those three graves are marked with white marble slabs flush with the plaza.

The Tomb has a flat-faced form and is relieved at the corners and along the sides by neo-classical [[pilaster]]s set into the surface with objects and inscription carved into the sides. The 1931 symbolism&lt;ref name="MemoryStone"/&gt; of the objects on the north, south and east sides changed over time.&lt;ref name="Quartermaster1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TGHistory"/&gt;
:'''North and South panel''' with 3 wreaths on each side represent (in 1931) "a world of memories" but later the six major battles engaged in by American forces in France: Ardennes, Belleau Wood, Château-Thierry, Meusse-Argonne, Oisiu-Eiseu, and Somme. Each wreath has 38 leaves and 12 berries.

Two Unknowns from World War II, one from the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]] and one from the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]], were placed in identical caskets and taken aboard the {{USS|Canberra|CA-70|6}}, a guided-missile cruiser resting off the Virginia Capes. Navy [[Hospital Corpsman]] 1st Class [[William R. Charette]], then the [[U.S. Navy]]'s only active-duty Medal of Honor recipient who was an enlisted man, selected the World War II Unknown. The remaining casket received a solemn [[burial at sea]].&lt;ref name="QuarterMaster1964"/&gt;

Four unknown Americans who died in the Korean War were disinterred from the [[National Cemetery of the Pacific]] in Hawaii. Army [[Master Sergeant#United States|Master Sergeant]] Ned Lyle made the final selection.&lt;ref name="QuarterMaster1964"/&gt;

Both caskets arrived in Washington on May 28, 1958, where they lay in the Capitol Rotunda&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; until the morning of May 30, when they were carried on [[Caisson (military)|caissons]] to Arlington National Cemetery.

{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
The designation of the Vietnam Unknown proved to be difficult. With improvements in [[DNA testing]] it is possible, though unlikely, that the recovered remains for every unknown soldier killed in the Vietnam War will be identified.

The Vietnam Unknown service member was originally designated by Medal of Honor recipient [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Sergeant Major|Sgt. Maj.]] [[Allan J. Kellogg|Allan Jay Kellogg, Jr.]], during a ceremony at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, May 17, 1984.

Each branch of the Armed Services took part in the transportation to honor the unknown. The Marines from Marine Barracks Hawaii consisted of an Honor Guard of 9 enlisted men and Lt. Denis Muller. The designated Vietnam Unknown was transported aboard the {{USS|Brewton|FF-1086|6}}, where the Marines stood guard over the casket during the voyage to [[Naval Air Station Alameda]], California. At Travis, the debarkation ceremony turned the remains over to the USAF on May 24. The next day, the remains of were flown from [[Travis Air Force Base]], California, arriving at [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland. Once there the remains were turned over to the US Army, where the remains were taken to Fort McNair for placement upon the horse-drawn wagon which later carried the Unknown to the Capital Rotunda for display before interment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  While on display for public viewing, all branches of the US Armed Forces stood in honor, guarding the casket of the Unknown for two weeks.

Many Vietnam veterans and President [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nancy Reagan]] visited the Vietnam Unknown in the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. An Army caisson carried the Vietnam Unknown from the Capitol to the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day, May 28, 1984.

President Reagan presided over the funeral, and presented the Medal of Honor to the Vietnam Unknown, and also acted as next of kin by accepting the interment flag at the end of the ceremony. The interment flags of all Unknowns at the Tomb of the Unknowns are on view in the Memorial Display Room.

===Identification of the Unknown===
In 1994, Ted Sampley, a [[POW/MIA]] activist, determined that the remains of the Vietnam Unknown were likely those of Air Force 1st Lt. [[Michael Blassie|Michael Joseph Blassie]], who was shot down near [[An Lộc]], Vietnam, in 1972. Sampley published an article in his newsletter and contacted Blassie's family, who attempted to pursue the case with the Air Force's casualty office without result. In January 1998, CBS News broadcast a report based on Sampley's investigation which brought political pressure to support the identification of the remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyC8BwPP8foC&amp;pg=PT301|title=On hallowed ground: the story of Arlington National Cemetery|author=Robert M. Poole|isbn=0-8027-1548-6|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|year=2009|pages=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was exhumed on May 14, 1998. Based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] testing, Department of Defense scientists confirmed the remains were those of Blassie. The identification was announced on June 30, 1998, and on July 10, Blassie's remains arrived home to his family in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; he was reinterred at [[Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery]] on July 11.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709214828/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAK/is_3_55/ai_111268876/ Memorial day tribute: holiday holds special meaning for Blassie family] - LaVonne Johnson, Citizen Airman. June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The identification took place after Blassie's family lobbied the Pentagon to perform the DNA testing. His remains (6 partial bones) had originally been recovered several months after his aircraft had been shot down and were not sufficient to allow for positive [[Body identification|identification]] at the time.

===Redesignation of the crypt===
The slab over the crypt that once held the remains of the Vietnam Unknown has since been replaced. The original inscription of "Vietnam" and the dates of the conflict has been changed to "Honoring and Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen" as a reminder of the commitment of the Armed Forces to the fullest possible accounting of missing service members. It was decided that the crypt would remain vacant.

==Tomb guards==
[[File:TombUN.gif|thumb|left|180px|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge]]
The tomb guards are soldiers of the United States Army. The first military guards were troopers from the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Cavalry, "Brave Rifles"]], who were posted nearby on [[Fort Myer]]. Since April 6, 1948, (known then as "[[Army Day]]"), when the regiment was reactivated, it has been guarded by soldiers from [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd Infantry Regiment, "The Old Guard"]]. The Old Guard is also posted to [[Fort Myer]], Virginia, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. It is considered one of the highest honors to serve as a [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|Sentinel]] at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Fewer than 20 percent of all volunteers are accepted for training and of those only a fraction pass training to become full-fledged Tomb Guards. This attrition rate has made the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge]] the second least-awarded qualification badge of the United States military (the first being the [[Astronaut Badge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McVeigh |first=Alex |title=First Tomb Badge recipient laid to rest |url=http://www.army.mil/article/16782/first-tomb-badge-recipient-laid-to-rest/ |date=February 11, 2009|work=The Official Home Page Of The United States Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soldier "walking the mat" does not wear rank insignia, so as not to outrank the Unknowns, whatever their ranks may have been. Non-commissioned officers (usually the Relief Commander and Assistant Relief Commanders), do wear insignia of their rank when changing the guard only. They have a separate uniform (without rank) that is worn when they actually guard the Unknowns or are "posted."

The duties of the sentinels are not purely ceremonial. The sentinels will confront people who cross the barriers at the tomb or whom they perceive to be disrespectful or excessively loud.

===Weapons===
Over the years there have been several different types of weapons used by the tomb guards. The changes in weapons reflect the changes in the Army, including the [[M1903 Springfield rifle]], [[M1 Garand]] and [[M14 rifle|M14]] rifles, and the [[M1911 pistol|M1911]], [[M9 pistol|M9]] and [[M17 pistol|M17]] pistols. Tomb guards currently carry M14 rifles, which are affixed to ceremonial rifle stocks. These rifles are cleaned daily and kept ready for use at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tombguard.org/society/faq/|title=Who Are The Tomb Guards|website=tombguard.org|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walking the mat===

There is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dqy6Z5HJ?url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/VisitorInformation/ChangingofTheGuard.aspx |archivedate=January 22, 2013 |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/VisitorInformation/ChangingofTheGuard.aspx |title=The Changing of the Guard |location=Arlington, Virginia |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb guard:

# Marches 21 steps south down the 63' long black mat laid across the Tomb.
# Turns and faces east, toward the Tomb, for 21 seconds.
# Turns and faces north, changes weapon to outside shoulder, and waits 21 seconds.
# Marches 21 steps down the mat.
# Turns and faces east for 21 seconds.
# Turns and faces south, changes weapon to outside shoulder, and waits 21 seconds.
# Repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the [[Guard Mounting|Changing of the Guard]].

After each turn, the guard executes a sharp "shoulder-arms" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.

Out of respect for the interred, the sentinels command silence at the tombs. If the guard walking the mat must vocally confront a disturbance from spectators, or a threat, the routine is interrupted, and remains so until the disturbance is under control. The sentinel will exit the mat, place the weapon in port arms position, and confront the disturbance. Once under control, the sentinel then walks on the pavement to the other side of the mat, turns to shoulder arms, and resumes the routine from the point of interruption.

Twenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowed—the [[21-gun salute]].

The mat is usually replaced twice per year: before [[Memorial Day]] and before [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]]. This is required because of the wear on the rubber mat by the special shoes worn by tomb guards. The sentinels have metal plates built into the soles and inner parts of their shoes to allow for a more rugged sole and to give the signature click of the heel during maneuvers. The sentinels wear sunglasses because of the bright reflection from the marble surrounding the Tomb and the Memorial Amphitheater.

On the ground not covered by the mat, a rust pattern in the tile can be seen that corresponds to the precise steps taken during the changing of the guard. The metal from the guards' boots causes the brown rust markings on the stone. On the mat itself, footprints caused by standing guard are also visible.

===Changing of the Guard===
[[File:Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|Changing of the Guard, 2005.]]

While Arlington National Cemetery is open, during the day in summer months from April 1 to September 30, the guard is changed every half hour. During the winter months, from October 1 to March 31, the guard is changed every hour. After the cemetery closes to the public (7 p.m. to 8 a.m. April through September, and 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. October through March), the guard is changed every 2 hours. The ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever [[Arlington National Cemetery]] is open.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tombguard.org/FAQ.html#How%20often%20are%20the%20guards%20changed? |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Society of the Honor Guard – Tomb of the Unknown Soldier |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035751/http://www.tombguard.org/FAQ.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/visiting.htm|title=Visiting Arlington National Cemetery &lt;!--|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery (commented out to improve cosmetics)--&gt;|accessdate=September 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guard change is very symbolic, but also conducted in accordance with Army regulations. The relief commander or assistant relief commander, along with the oncoming guard, are both required for a guard change to take place. The relief commander orders the guard being relieved to "pass on your orders" to the oncoming guard. The guard being relieved will say to the oncoming guard, "Post and orders remain as directed." The oncoming guard's response is always, "Orders acknowledged." During changes when the public is witnessing the ceremony, the commander will inform the public that the ceremony is about to take place and that those in attendance should remain "silent and standing" throughout the entire event.

===Dedication===
A civilian guard was first posted at the Tomb on November 17, 1925, to prevent, among other things, families from picnicking on the flat marble slab with views of the city. A military guard was first posted on March 25, 1926. The first 24-hour guard was posted on midnight, July 2, 1937. The Tomb of the Unknowns has been guarded continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb of the Unknown Soldier FAQ|url=https://tombguard.org/society/faq/|publisher=Society of the Honor Guard Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclement weather,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/hurricanes/vigilant-tomb-unknowns-irene/story?id=14397525|title=Tomb of the Unknowns Guarded, Despite Irene|first=A.

Since 1948, the tomb guards, a special platoon within the [[3rd United States Infantry Regiment|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] (The Old Guard) work on a team rotation of 24 hours on, 24 hours off, for five days, taking the following four days off. A guard takes an average of six hours to prepare his uniform&amp;nbsp;– heavy wool, regardless of the time of year&amp;nbsp;– for the next day's work. In addition to preparing the uniform, guards also conduct physical training, tomb guard training, participate in field exercises, cut their hair before the next work day, and at times are involved in regimental functions as well. Tomb guards are required to memorize 35 pages of information about Arlington National Cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

A special Army decoration, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge]] is authorized for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions (from a pool of more than 300), a uniform test with two gigs (errors) or fewer (measured to the 1/64"), and a test on the guard changing sequence. After serving honorably for a period of nine months, and having passed the sequence of tests, a tomb guard is permanently awarded the Badge. Since the first award on February 7, 1958, fewer than 650 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this badge, including four women. A small number of tomb guard Identification Badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as Guards before 1959. Those numbers make the Badge the second rarest award currently issued in the United States Army; only the [[Astronaut Badge#United States Army|Army Astronaut Badge]] is rarer.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Tomb Guard Identification Badge is the only badge awarded by the United States Army that can be revoked after a soldier has left the military. The Regimental Commander of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment has the authority to revoke a badge from any Guard (past or present) for any act that would bring discredit upon the Tomb of the Unknowns.{{cite web|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf |format=PDF |title=Army Regulation 600-8-22 – "Military Awards" (11 December 2006); para. 8-40f |publisher=Department of the Army |quote= |accessdate=June 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181345/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The badge was designed in 1956 and first issued to members of the Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns on February 7, 1958. The badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item, meaning the soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the honor guard. Upon leaving the duty, the badge was returned and reissued to incoming soldiers. In 1963, a regulation was enacted that allowed the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform, even after the soldier's completion of duty at the Tomb of the Unknowns.

==Damage and repair to the Tomb Monument==
[[File:Tomb of the Unknowns crack.jpg|thumb|The crack can be seen underneath the words "An American" and above the word "Soldier."]]

Cracking and weathering are causing concerns for the long-term preservation of the Tomb Monument. A November 1963 report first recorded horizontal cracking of the monument's marble die block. Though this was the first time that the damage was documented, the report made it clear that the cracks had become visible some time before that date.&lt;ref name="Damage"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/photo_gallery/ANC.pdf |title=Arlington National Cemetery Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Repair or Replacement Project (draft) |date=June 1, 2006 |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627190146/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/photo_gallery/ANC.pdf |archivedate=June 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963–1964, there were two cracks—referred to as "primary" and "secondary"—extending approximately 34 feet around the die block. By 1974, they had extended to 40 feet. They grew another 4.6 feet over the next 15 years. Inspection has determined that the cracks have increased horizontally since 1990. Analysis also indicates that the cracks are not surficial &lt;!-- NOTE that "surficial" (on the surface) is the correct spelling of the word and this is the word used in the source. Please do not change it. --&gt; but extend partially through the block and will eventually extend all the way through.&lt;ref name="Damage"/&gt;

The 1990 report documented deterioration of the marble's surface. As much as 2.85&amp;nbsp;mm of the marble surface has been lost through weathering. The study projected that before 2010, the Tomb Monument will have been weathered enough to have a negative effect on the experience of the visitors and concludes the only solutions are to enclose or replace the monument.&lt;ref name="Damage"/&gt;

Several options have been considered to deal with the damage. Officials at Arlington National Cemetery determined that proper repair can return the Tomb Monument to an acceptable appearance. However, because the cracks will continue to lengthen and widen, continuous grouting, regrouting, touch-up, monitoring, and maintenance would be required. Therefore, a report commissioned by Arlington National Cemetery and published in June 2006 confirmed the Cemetery's conclusion that "replacement of the three pieces of the Tomb Monument is the preferred alternative". A final decision was scheduled to be made on September 30, 2007.&lt;ref name="Damage"/&gt;

The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] objects to the plan to replace the authentic Tomb Monument. The Trust expressed concern that Arlington National Cemetery seeks to replace the existing monument with marble from the original quarry, which experts agree is likely eventually to crack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org/advocacy/arlington.html |title=Take Action for Historic Preservation |publisher=Nationaltrust.org |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust has observed that the Cemetery's own 1990 report recommended that the monument be repaired and that the Cemetery, in fact, commissioned Oehrlein Architects to repair the stone. In 2007, Mary Oehrlein informed Congressional staff members that: "The existing monument can easily be repaired, as was done 17 years ago, using conventional conservation methods to re-grout the cracks. Once repaired, the fault lines would be virtually invisible from the public viewing areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2014595&amp;page=1 Crack Mars Tomb of the Unknown Soldier], ABC News May 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008 report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Alternative Measures To Address Cracks in the Monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r110:FLD001:S58839|publisher=Congressional Record|accessdate=February 25, 2012|author1=John Paul Woodley, Jr., Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works)|author2=William F.

On September 26, 2007, U.S. Senator [[Daniel Akaka]] announced that an amendment crafted together with Senator [[Jim Webb]] will be added to the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 1585) that would require a report on the plans of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to replace the monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns. The secretaries would be required to advise Congress on the current efforts to maintain and preserve the monument. Additionally, they would have to provide an assessment on the feasibility and advisability of repairing rather than replacing the Tomb Monument. Finally, if the secretaries choose replacement, they would have to report those plans and detail how they intend to dispose of the current monument. Once the report is provided, the secretaries are prevented from taking action to replace the monument for at least 180 days. The Akaka-Webb amendment was included in the bill by unanimous consent of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?0e425682-964e-4ca3-a18e-5b79fd449c2d|title=Akaka-Webb Amendment to Halt Replacement of the Monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns is Approved by Senate|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=September 28, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112181824/http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?0e425682-964e-4ca3-a18e-5b79fd449c2d &lt;!--|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery (commented out to improve cosmetics)--&gt; |archivedate = January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill authorized a review of the monument's condition.

A03.&lt;/ref&gt; Final passage of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for 2008 (H.R. 4986) was signed by President Bush on January 28, 2008.
[[File:TousRepairSep2011.jpg|thumb|October 21, 2011: Completed repair of the cracks in the Tomb.]]

In 2003 John Haines, a retired car dealer, offered to donate a large slab of marble to the Arlington National Cemetery to replace the existing marble. Haines paid $31,000 for the marble slab.&lt;ref name=Donation&gt;Nancy Lofholm, [http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_10232801 Marble for Unknowns tomb just sits], Denver Post, August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The marble was not removed from the quarry, however, because imperfections were found and the block was rejected.

In June 2009 Arlington National Cemetery and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] announced that the monument was to be repaired, not replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= William |last=McMichael |authorlink= |title=Tomb of Unknowns to be repaired, not replaced |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/06/military_tomb_unknown_repair_062609w/ |work=Army Times |publisher=Army Times Publishing Company |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the cracks were filled but the repairs lasted only a few months.&lt;ref name=Engineers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/armyengineersnorfolk#p/u/1/L2LIvGB_89I|title=Norfolk District Army Corps|website=YouTube|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, the cemetery was struggling to repair the cracks in the monument, one of which measured {{convert|28.4|ft}} long, with another at {{convert|16.2|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Christian, "Repairs On Persistent Cracks At Tomb Of Unknowns Delayed", ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 9, 2011, p.

==The American Bar Association's list==
In 1989, the [[American Bar Association]] rated the twelve best trial films of all time, and provided a detailed and reasoned legal evaluation for its choices.&lt;ref name="aba-list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/students-teachers/movies.shtml|title=Verone, Patric M.

Ten of the movies take place (at least in part) in courtrooms.

The American Bar Association also published a list of the 12 best trial plays, noting that the transition from film to the stage is sometimes difficult. It also has an extensive honorable mention list.&lt;ref name="Schachner"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_theaters_12_greatest_courtroom_dramas/ |title=The Theater's 12 Greatest Courtroom Dramas |date=August 1, 2012 |first1=Jill Schachner |last1=Chanen |work=ABA Journal |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oddities===
The trial in ''M'' is ''not'' in a legal courtroom. Instead, the city's crime syndicate leaders and underground elements hold proceedings in a warehouse. Despite the lack of legal trappings, "it is one of the most effective trials ever filmed, questioning our notions of justice and revenge, mob rule and order, power and responsibility. Our social orientation is flip-flopped." Wearing long leather coats instead of robes, criminals become judges. The murderer is cast as the victim, while the forces of law and order must rely on luck. [[Peter Lorre]] strikingly raises the issue of his culpability due to alleged insanity, and the imposition of ultimate retributive justice is depicted as being unsatisfying for society and the survivors of the murdered victims.&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

Outside of the first few minutes of the film, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' never enters a court room at all. It views the particular case and the system of justice through the prism of a jury's deliberations. The film explains practical explications of legal concepts basic to the American system of justice, and their effect on a particular trial and defendant. Those include the [[presumption of innocence]], [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and the requirement of proof beyond a [[reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

==American Film Institute==
In 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] compiled its own "courtroom drama" ten best list. It includes five of the films on the ABA list — ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' and ''[[The Verdict]]'' — and adds ''[[A Cry in the Dark]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', and ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''.&lt;ref name="afi.com"/&gt;

The film can be seen from the perspective of Judicial Qualifications Commissions (also known as Judicial Tenure Commissions), which are judicial agencies charged with overseeing judicial performance and conduct. From that end of the telescope, the indictment of the courts and judicial system (and the examples) are not so outlandish as might be supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=2841|title=Apollo Guide Review "And Justice for All" by Norman Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starred [[Al Pacino]], [[Jack Warden]], and [[John Forsythe]].

The '''University of Arts in Belgrade''' ({{lang|sr|Универзитет уметности у Београду / Univerzitet umetnosti u Beogradu}}) is a [[List of universities in Serbia|public university]] in Serbia. It was founded in 1957 as the '''Academy of Arts''' to unite four academies. It became a university and acquired its current name in 1973.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of the University |publisher=University of Arts in Belgrade |url=http://www.arts.bg.ac.rs/rektoraten/uu/?id=istorijatuu |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006191238/http://www.arts.bg.ac.rs/rektoraten/uu/?id=istorijatuu |archivedate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Arts was established on June 10, 1957, as the Academy of Arts, a union of the existing higher art schools (academies). Until then independent, the Academy of Music (founded in 1937), the Academy of Fine Arts (founded in 1937), the Academy of Applied Arts (founded in 1948) and the Academy of Theatrical Arts (founded in 1948) became the Academy of Art, an association of higher art schools in Belgrade.

In 1973, these four academies, being the only higher art schools in Serbia at that time, became faculties: the Faculty of Fine Arts, the Faculty of Music, the Faculty of Applied Arts and Design and the Faculty of Dramatic Arts (theater, film, radio and television). Being their association, the then Academy of Arts became the University of Arts in Belgrade.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Interdisciplinary studies of the University of Arts in Belgrade were founded in 2001, as contemporary conceived studies in the domain of polymedia, digital arts, scene design, theory of arts and media and management in the culture. Interdisciplinary studies were created out of the need of studying contemporary artistic or theoretical fields which are not covered by usual artistic and scientific disciplines. These studies research new artistic and theoretical practices, which are linked to studies on particular faculties.
