This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1658'''.

==Events==
*[[March 5]] – A play adapted from ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is performed by students of the Gymnasium in [[Zittau]], the earliest record of a [[Shakespearean comedy]] produced anywhere in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; authorship is attributed to [[Christian Keymann]], but remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Cohn (scholar) |title=Shakespeare in Germany in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries: An Account of English Actors in Germany and the Netherlands, and of the Plays Performed by Them during the Same Period|publisher=Asher and Co. |location=London and Berlin |year=1865 |pages=cxxiv–cxxv |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This climate inspires the [[Silesia]]n playwright [[Andreas Gryphius]]. Also this year, he prints one of the first secular [[Baroque]] works in [[German literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frantz |first=Barbara |title=The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature |editor1=Eigler, Friederike Ursula |editor2=Kord, Susanne |chapter=Baroque Literature|publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1997 |page=40 |isbn=0-313-29313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the verse comedy ''Absurda Comica oder Herr Peter Squenz''. Borrowing from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (including its main character, [[Peter Quince]]), Gryphius' text rejects ''[[Meistersinger]]'' culture, while also "reinvigorating the tradition" of German-language theater after the long hiatus of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=John |title=Camden House History of German Literature.

*[[May 29]] – [[Dara Shukoh]], heir-apparent to the crown of the [[Mughal Empire]], is defeated by his younger brother, [[Aurangzeb]], in the [[Battle of Samugarh]]. Dara's overtures toward [[Vedanta]] and [[Sufism in India|Sufism]], including his promotion of the [[Upanishads]], are condemned, as Aurangzeb formally adheres to [[Islamic fundamentalism]] – and in practice to a less syncretic [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pirbhai |first=M.

The city is devastated, and its role in fostering [[Renaissance humanism]] is forever ended: though restored, the Bethlen Collegium is transferred to [[Aiud|Nagyenyed (Aiud)]]. Approximately 20,000 books are destroyed in the raid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giura |first=Maura Geraldina |title=Colecționari și biblioteci din Transilvania în sec.

*[[September 13]] ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O. S.]] September 3) – Death of [[Oliver Cromwell]], inaugurating the transition from [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] to [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. The event inspires [[Andrew Marvell]] to write "A Poem upon the Death of his Late Highness the Lord Protector"; this piece is not included in the official edition of Cromwellian panegyrics, which has verse by [[John Dryden]], [[Thomas Sprat]], and [[Edmund Waller]]. All these poets, alongside [[John Milton]], will be ridiculed in Richard Watson's [[1659 in literature|1659]] pamphlet, ''The Panegyrike and the Storme''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ezell |first=Margaret J.

[[Cornelius Ryan]]'s '''''A Bridge Too Far''''' gives an account of [[Operation Market Garden]], a failed [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] attempt to break through German lines at [[Arnhem]] in the occupied Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The title of the book comes from a comment made by British Lieutenant General [[Frederick Browning]], deputy commander of the [[First Allied Airborne Army]], who told [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] before the operation, "I think we may be going a bridge too far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=Cornelius |author-link=Cornelius Ryan |title=A Bridge Too Far |p=67 |year=1974 |location=London |publisher=Hamish Hailton |edition=first |isbn=0-241-89073-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on a wide variety of sources, Ryan also documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps and included a section on the survivors, “Soldiers and Civilians – What They Do Today”. One particular focus was on the tactical mistakes made in planning the operation. Until Ryan's book, Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history. Popular accounts of World War II usually tended not to mention the battle at all or put Montgomery's spin on it as being a "partial success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.army.mod.uk/para/history/arnhem.htm |title=The Battle for Arnhem |publisher=The Parachute Regiment |accessdate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626112415/http://www.army.mod.uk/para/history/arnhem.htm |archivedate=26 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 book was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London. There were frequent later editions, and a [[A Bridge Too Far (film)|film]] based on it was released in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = William Goldman's Story of a Bridge Too Far | first = William | last = Goldman | year = 1977 | author-link = William Goldman | publisher = [[Coronet Books]] | isbn = 0-340-22340-5 | ref = harv}} [NB: Book has no page numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
==="Extra"===

Granny Lin, a fifty-one-year-old spinster, struggles to find work after she is "honorably retired" from a [[Beijing]] garment factory and is denied a pension. Her colleague Auntie Wang recommends that she get married so she can be financially secure with an inheritance. She reluctantly agrees to be matched with Old Tang, a seventy-six year old widower struggling with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Once she is married to him, she has to pretend that Old Tang's previous wife is still alive but ill at the hospital. One day, while they are bathing, Old Tang insists that his previous wife is still alive and, in a fit of passion, tussles with Granny Lin; during their scuffle, he slips and subsequently dies.

After the funeral, in which she refuses to accept any inheritance out go guilt, one of Old Tang's sons recommends her for a job as a maid at the Mei-Mei Academy, a primary boarding school in the mountainous western suburb of Beijing. There, she develops a bond with Kang, a newly-arrived, six-year-old student.

==="Immortality"===

For generations, a small village has consistently produced [[eunuch|Great Papas]] for the imperial families of [[Dynastic China]]. When imperial rule ends and the [[Communist-controlled China (1927–49)|Communist party]] takes control of the nation, the village falls out of favor with the ruling power and loses its reputation.

During a nationwide famine, a boy tries to steal a sparrow for his sick mother; one of the villager castigates him for this. When the others realizes that the boy bares the face of [[Mao Zedong|the dictator]], they let him take as many birds as he wants. During his upbringing, the villagers pay keen attention to keeping him out of harm's way, fearing injury to him will cause them bad luck; however, they also refuse to interact with him, especially keen to keeping their daughters away from him. After the dictator's death, the community goes into a state of mourning, not hearing from the boy (who is now a young man) for years.

One day, when he is in his late twenties, he leaves the village via car for the capital. After many auditions followed by trials, the young man is selected as the dictator's impersonator, starring in films and becoming a recognizable celebrity. When the young man is in his forties and western influences enter the nation's conscience, he begins to doubt his role. Prior, he was a virgin who saw himself too "great" for a woman's body; after reading a biography of the dictator, he begins to incessantly crave sex. As a result, he attempts to secretly fulfill his desires with a prostitute; however, the pimp sets-up the young man, taking embarrassing photographs of him and threatening to release it to the public unless he pays a king's ransom. The young man refuses, and after the photographs' release, he is disgracefully discharged by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|party]].

When the young man returns to the village, he ignores all the greetings from the villagers and heads straight for his mother's grave. There, he "[[Castration|cleans]]" himself, but survives the bleeding and subsequently lives the rest of his life in the village.

After the crackdown by the government, only students with relatives in the [[United States]] can study abroad there. Sansan, feeling pity for the government backlash against Min, tells Tu (who supposedly has an uncle living in the states) to marry Min and takes her with him during his graduate studies in [[Pennsylvania]], with the promise to divorce Min and return to Beijing after Min is sponsored in the states. Even though Tu suggests that he and Sansan have sex before his departure, she refuses, citing a passage from ''[[Women in Love]]'' about how doing so will make him crave other women more. Despite their promise, Tu falls in love with Min and does not return.

Her mother responds by citing that since she is no longer a virgin, no man wants to marry her, reiterating the town's belief that she and Tu did have sex before he left. Some time later, a  uncouthly-dressed man enters the marketplace with a sign reading: "Give me ten [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]] and I will let you slice me once wherever you like; if you finish my life with one cut, you owe me nothing."

The notion of '''affective design''' emerged from the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI)&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D. A. (1986). Design principles for human-computer interfaces. In D. E. Berger, K. Pezdek, &amp; W. P. Banks (Eds.). Applications of cognitive psychology: Problem solving, education, and computing.

[online], available: http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Affective design involves designing interfaces to enable human-computer interactions where emotional information is communicated by the user in a

[[Image:Anna Camaiti.jpg|thumb|upright|Anna Camaiti Hostert]]
'''Anna Camaiti Hostert''' (born July 19, 1949, in [[Florence]], Italy) is an [[Italian American]] philosopher and a scholar of [[Visual Studies]]. She lives and works between Italy and the United States.

==Biography==
She obtained her degree in Philosophy at the [[University of Pisa]] (Italy) defending a dissertation with the philosopher Nicola Badaloni. Then she received a Ph.D in Literature and Film from the [[University of Chicago]]. She has taught at [[Loyola University of Chicago]], at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois, Chicago]], and at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] (Italy). She was ''Visiting Professor'' at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) in Los Angeles and at the Florence campus of the [[New York University]] (NYU) Tisch School of Cinema. She was also ''Distinguished Visiting Professor'' at [[Florida Atlantic University]] (FAU) in Boca Raton. She was Acting Associate Dean at the [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]]’s campus in Rome.

In 1999 she founded along the philosopher [[Mario Perniola]] the magazine ''[[Agalma (journal)|Agalma: Magazine of Aesthetic and Cultural Studies]]'' of whose editorial committee she is still a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.agalmaweb.org/redazione.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013182427/http://www.agalmaweb.org/redazione.php# |archive-date=2012-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986 she has been part of the Italian Bar Association of Journalists and for several years the press attaché to the Governor of Tuscany Region. Later, she had a TV program about cinema on RaiSat channel titled ''Metix'' from the title of one of her books. She has been a guest at numerous Film Festivals in Italy and of several TV and radio cultural programs. She has collaborated with the director [[Fiorella Infascelli]] in the movie ''Italiani'' presented at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1998.

She has written for the newspaper ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' .

==Thought==

===History of philosophy and politics===
The initial period of Camaiti Hostert’s research focused on the history of political philosophy following the methodological analysis of Nicola Badaloni, under whose tutelage she studied at the University of Pisa. In her first work, ''Giuseppe Toniolo. Alle origini del partito cattolico'' (1984; ''Giuseppe Toniolo. The origins of the Catholic Party'') – that resulted from her dissertation in Philosophy – she traced the intellectual biography of the thinker [[Giuseppe Toniolo]], by retrieving his prominent figure in the Catholic Movement, and casting light on his role in the subsequent foundation of the first Catholic Party in its relationship with the Marxist concept of the main political subject.

The same historical-philosophical perspective defines also the second work by Camaiti Hostert titled ''Politica e diritto di resistenza. Kant ed Erhard: democrazia e libertà del soggetto'' (1987, ''The Politics and the Right of Resistance. Kant and Erhard: Democracy and Human Freedom''). In this work Camaiti Hostert has traced the relationship between the German Jacobinism, of which Johann Benjamin Erhard is one of the most representative authors, and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s theory of Public Right, Political Will and Civil Liberty. Through the concepts of «resistance» and «insurrection», she interprets Erhard’s theses as an attempt to build a theory of the antagonistic subject.

===Cultural studies and identity theory===
Because of her intellectual, academic and existential relation with the United States and with the socio-cultural dynamics of this country, Camaiti Hostert first developed themes related to [[comparative literature]] (see for instance her afterword to the American edition of the [[Dacia Maraini]]’s novel, ''The Silent Duchess'', Feminist Press 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/books/the-silence.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Anna+Camaiti+Hostert&amp;st=nyt|title=The Silence|first=Kathryn|last=Harrison|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amatangelo, S. 2002. «Coming to Her Senses: The Journey of the Mother in La Lunga Vita Di Marianna Ucria». ''Italica : Bulletin of the American Association of Teachers of Italian''. 79&lt;/ref&gt;) and then has moved towards the [[Cultural studies]] with the analysis of the [[Post-colonial theory|post-colonial theories]], especially by focusing on the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern subject]] and on identity construction.

Through this research, Camaiti Hostert engages a sometimes critical confrontation with many important cultural theorists like [[Edward Said]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and [[Homi K. Bhabha]] and with political thinkers, like [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Her major work in this field of investigation is ''Passing. Dissolvere le identità, superare le differenze'' (''Passing. A Strategy to Dissolve Identities and Remap Differences''). Dealing with the complex theme of [[Alterity]] as it relates to the Italian women’s movement, especially to the works of Carla Lonzi&lt;ref&gt;E. Chiti Lucchesi, «Luoghi del non ritorno: sogni, parole e immagini», in Borghi, Liana, and Uta Treder (eds). ''Il globale e l'intimo: luoghi del non ritorno''. Perugia: Morlacchi, 2007: 59&lt;/ref&gt; and the theories of sexual difference, the analysis of ''Passing'' tackles the [[feminist studies]], particularly the point of convergence between [[Post-colonial studies|post-colonial]] and [[gender studies]] ([[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri C. Spivak]], [[bell hooks]], [[Teresa de Lauretis]], [[Rosi Braidotti]]) and from that point it expands its reflection to the process of formation of any ethnic and sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, Michael, and Antonio Negri. ''Empire''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2000: 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lingel, Jessa. 2009. «Adjusting the Borders: Bisexual Passing and Queer Theory». ''Journal of Bisexuality''. 9, no. 3-4:381-405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual studies and film theory===
Visual Studies - that were born as a field of interdisciplinary research on the wake of the Anglo-American [[Cultural Studies]] – have become since the late ‘90s the focus of Camaiti Hostert’s research. In ''Metix. Cinema globale e cultura visuale'' (Meltemi 2004, ''Metix. Global Cinema and Visual Culture'') - work that collects Camaiti Hostert’s findings during those years - she has analyzed the structure of the vision, the dynamics of the gaze and the processes of images production in contemporary cinema (mainly American cinema, but not only [[Hollywood]]).

Visual Studies in general and Camaiti Hostert’s work in particular, interpret images not as isolated objects, but as clusters of several practices which change use and meaning of the images themselves: if cinema represents the medium from which Camaiti Hostert’s analysis has begun, her analysis expands to all visual languages, including TV, advertisings, Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Marie-Christine. 2012. «Culture populaire et séries télévisées». ''Amerika''. no. 6. http://amerika.revues.org/2969&lt;/ref&gt; The pivotal passage of the text is the transition from the idea that an image is able to mean something, to the understanding that this ability is tied with the formation of the subject identity.

According to Camaiti Hostert’s theory [[Visual Studies]] show the similarities between the analysis of the [[visual culture]] and the analysis of the construction of cultural, gender and ethnic identities and differences, with particular attention to the unmasking of visual stereotypes that have represented the various forms of marginality.&lt;ref&gt;De Ruggieri, Francesca. ''Matrix and the city: il corpo ibrido nel cinema e nella cultura visuale''. Pisa: ETS, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work is linked to Camaiti Hostert’s parallel research into the field of [[Film Studies]]. Regarding  this domain of studies, the two particularly relevant essays collection (both edited in 2002) are ''Sentire il cinema'' (2002; ''Feeling Cinema'') - entirely composed of Camaiti Hostert’s essays and interviews (with directors such [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Fiorella Infascelli]], Wilma Labate and [[Mario Martone]]) – and ''Scene italoamericane. Rappresentazioni cinematografiche degli italiani d’America'' edited with the Italian American scholar [[Anthony Julian Tamburri]] (Luca Sossella editore 2002, American edition ''Screening Ethnicity. Cinematographic Representations of Italian Americans in the United States'', [[Bordighera Press]], 2002 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1432/is_2_80/ai_n29018668/?tag=content;col1 |title=CBSi |publisher=FindArticles.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;), including essays by [[Ben Lawton]], Fred Gardaphé, Alberto Abruzzese among others as well as by Camaiti Hostert and Tamburri.

In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.&lt;ref name=Fellous-review&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668–674|doi=10.2307/20445371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84–91|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro /&gt;

== Basis for Emotional Responses to Art ==
Evolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134–151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt;

Another example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | year = 2003 | title = ART AND MOOD: PRELIMINARY NOTES AND CONJECTURES | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521–555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meta-Emotions ===
The optimal visual artwork creates what Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav call "meta-emotions." These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce "meta-emotions."&lt;ref name="noy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.

Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message ./..&lt;ref name="noy" /&gt;

==Types of elicited emotions==

tions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–51|doi=10.1037/a0014632}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure–displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Liking and comprehensibility ===
Pleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;

Furthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt; Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt;

===Knowledge emotions===
Knowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Interest====
Interest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt;

====Confusion====
Confusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75–80|doi=10.1037/a0017081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; 
Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Surprise====
Surprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.

===Hostile emotions===
Hostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Self-conscious emotions===
Self-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Sublime feelings====
Researchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071–1074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt; Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt;

====Aesthetic chills====
{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}
Another common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208–214|doi=10.1037/a0021914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt;

===Effects of expertise===
The fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated /&gt;

Other researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139–161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt; However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt;

====Expertise and museum visits====
Due to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt;

==Theories and models of elicited emotions==
Researchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fellous-review /&gt;

===Appraisal theory===
The [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;

====Appraisal and negative emotions====
A newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt;

===Minimal model===
Other psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212–226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt;   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt; These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.

===Five-step aesthetic experience===
Other theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80–97|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.

====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====
The first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====
After viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part three: Secondary control and escape====
When an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====
If viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====
After the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

==Pupillary response tests==
In order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156–163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868–885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; 
[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]

===Pupil responses to art===
After viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt;

====Left-cheek biases====
[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]
These effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447–455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt;

This research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;

==Art as emotional regulation==
Art is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255–261|doi=10.1037/a0026909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288–295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Venting===
Venting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Distraction===
Distraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt; Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

'''Art criticism''' is the discussion or evaluation of visual art.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gemtou|first=Eleni|title=Subjectivity in Art History and Art Criticism|journal=Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities|year=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2–13|url=http://rupkatha.com/V2/n1/SubjectivityinArtHistoryandArt%20Criticism.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be. It perhaps began with art historians taking interest in modern art."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E. Neaulme|location=Utrecht|url=https://archive.org/details/reflexionscriti03jeagoog|edition=3rd|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the acclaim of [[Voltaire]] for the sagacity of his approach to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire |title=Le Siècle de Louis XIV|year=1874|publisher=Charpentier et C&lt;sup&gt;ie&lt;/sup&gt;, Libraires-Éditeurs|location=Paris|page=581|url=https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog|editor=Charles Louandre|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] with ''Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France'' who wrote about the Salon of 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Font de Saint-Yenne|first=Étienne|title=Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France : avec un examen des principaux ouvrages exposés au Louvre le mois d'août 1746|year=1747|publisher=Jean Neaulme|location=The Hague|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting on the socioeconomic framework of the production of the then popular [[Baroque]] art style,&lt;ref name="saisselin1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saisselin|first=Rémy G.|title=The Enlightenment Against the Baroque: Economics and Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–50|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0779n6fb/|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a perception of anti-monarchist sentiments in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Walter |first=Nancy Paige Ryan |title=From Armida to Cornelia: Women and Representation in Prerevolutionary France |type=MA |page=11 |url=http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15694 |year=1995 |publisher=Texas Tech University |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M.

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 9 March 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.Retrieved 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

===Art blogs===

'''''Cath Finntrágha'''''&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Alternative spellings include ''Cath Finntrága'' (Meyer) and ''Cath Fionntrágha''.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''The Battle of Ventry'''''&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Alternative English titles include ''The Battle of Ventry / Ventry Harbour/ Ventry Strand / the White Strand''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Early Modern Irish]] prose narrative of the [[Finn Cycle]]. It dates probably to the 15th century in its current form, but apparently relied on older material. It concerns the deeds of the warrior-hero [[Finn mac Cumaill]] and his ''[[fianna]]'' as they defend Ireland against a foreign invasion led by the world-king Dáire Donn.

==Synopsis==
[[Dáire]] (or Dáiri) Donn, called "king of the great world" and ostensibly the most powerful ruler in Europe, intends to invade Ireland. Apart from seeking to gratify a more general ambition to conquer territory, he has a pretext and motif which are directed at [[Finn mac Cumaill]] in person. First of all, Dáire seeks retribution for the fact that Finn has eloped with the wife and daughter of Bolcán (Vulcan), King of France, when in the mercenary service of the latter. Second, Dáire's sense of honour and pride is ignited by stories about Finn's successes. He musters a large body of forces from all across Europe and invades Ireland at ''Finntraighe'' (lit. 'fair strand'), the shore of [[Ventry]] ([[County Kerry]]), near [[Dingle]]. A mighty and protracted battle ensues. Finn's son [[Oisín]] faces Bolcán in combat, who much like [[Buile Shuibhne|Suibne Geilt]], goes insane and flies off, ultimately landing at Glenn Bolcáin. The young son of the King of Ulster arrives with a troop of boys to rally to Finn's support but is killed. It is only when the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] are called in that the Irish become victorious. When Finn slays Dáire Donn and the Greek amazon Ógarmach, the invaders admit defeat and take flight.

==Manuscripts and textual history==
The text in its present form was probably written in the 15th century and is represented by two vellum manuscripts: (1) Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B. 487, 1–11, and (2) Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 29 (''olim'' 23 L 24), 328–337, 355–361. In a note to Rawlinson B. 487, the scribe [[Finnlaech Ó Cathasaigh]] of Tirawley (County Mayo) declares to have composed the tale for Sadbh Ní Mháille (daughter of Tadg Ó Maille), wife of [[Richard MacWilliam Bourke]] (d. 1479).

Earlier allusions to Finn's battle at Ventry suggest that one or several versions of the story were current as early as the 12th century. The event is first referred to in a love-story of the ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]'', in which Finn sets out to meet the enemy in battle, but interrupts the journey to act as a match-maker for Cáel and Créde. During the seventeen days of the battle, the couple offer assistance to Finn, but on the last day, Cáel drowns at sea in pursuit of an opponent and Créde dies of grief.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;''Acallam na Senórach'', tr. Dooley and Roe, pp. 24–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the 15th-century ''Cath Finntrágha'' appears to offer a thoroughly revised tale, which incorporates miscellaneous narrative material from the Finn Cycle, the [[Ulster Cycle]] and the [[Mythological Cycle]]. It has been argued that much of its framework was suggested by the earlier tale ''[[Cath Trága Rudraigi]]'' (''The Battle of Dundrum Bay''), in which [[Norsemen]] forces invade Ireland and do battle at [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum Bay]] (County Down).

==Antiquarian commentary==
[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] provides a number of interesting insights into the Battle of Ventry in his Ordnance Survey letters of 1841. He noted several burial carns near Cantraw, presumed evidence of a great slaughter, along with local claims of finds of many bones and skulls at the east end of the strand. He also noted a boggy area known for the slaughter of the mighty men,  ''Guin na dTreanfhear''.&lt;ref&gt;John O’Donovan in his Ordnance Survey Letters on the Antiquities of the County of Kerry, of 30 July 1841 (ref. 14/C/30/8 (viii) [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/aai-files/assets/ebooks/OSI-Letters/KERRY_14%20C%2030.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Chiwara''' (also '''Chi wara''', '''Ci Wara''', or '''Tyi Wara'''; {{lang-bm|ciwara}}; {{lang-fr|tchiwara}}) is a ritual object representing an [[antelope]], used by the [[Bambara people|Bambara]] ethnic group in [[Mali]]. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques.

== Stylistic variations ==
Chiwara masks are categorized in three ways: [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]], [[vertical direction|vertical]], or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a [[phallus]]. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.

The appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct "signature" or "school" of Chiwara figures.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Wardwell (November 1984) A Bambara Master Carver, ''African Arts'', '''18'''(1):pp83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;   These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus ''the [[Bougouni]] / Southern region style'' are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; ''the [[Bamako]] / Northern region style'' is usually of the horizontal style; ''the [[Ségou|Segu]]/ Northern region style'' (the heartland of the [[Bambara Empire]]) matches the vertical style with the unique "cut out" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including ''the [[Sikasso]] region style'', with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.&lt;ref&gt;See descriptions at  [http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/ciwara-african-chimeras/index.html Ciwara, African chimeras.

==Ceremonial usage==
In [[Bambara language|Bambara]], ''chi'' ''wara'' means ''laboring'' ''wild animal'',&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Nina Sobol Levent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and is a representation of Bambara [[Mythology|mythos]] about the creation of farming.

=== Mousso Koroni ===
While there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals.

=== The Chi Wara figure ===
The Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a [[Roan Antelope]] with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the [[aardvark]] who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of [[millet]], and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of [[raffia]] stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth.
The Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back.

===''chi wara ton''===
As farmers of the upper [[Niger river]] [[savanna]], the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace [[Islam]], after the fall of the [[Bambara Empire]] in the late 19th century.
Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste cofraternities (''ton''/''jo''/''jow''), and the ''chi wara ton'' society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the ''Soli'' age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the ''chi wara ton'' pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends.

The ''chi wara ton'' is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction.

=== Dance ===
The Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a "Sogono Kuni" ("Little antelope head"), which is quite rare to find in museums. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/chiwara.htm princetonol.com: Chi Wara Headdress of the Bamana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024353/http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/chiwara.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}.

== World influence ==
African sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called ''Primitive Art''. The artist [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and collector [[Paul Guillaume]] published images of the Chiwara in their ''Sculptures nègres'' in 1917, while [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], and [[Les Fauves]] became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of French studies of African sculpture among the artists, critics, and collectors of Modern Art include: ''À propos d'art nègre'' by Guillaume Apollinaire; ''Opinions sur l'art nègre'' with contributions by Braque, [[Matisse]], and Picasso; ''Rencontre avec l'art nègre'' by [[Jean Laude]]; ''La Sculpture nègre et l'art moderne'' by Paul Guillaume; and  ''L'art nègre'' by [[Henri Clouzot]] and [[André Level]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] exhibit ''African Negro Art'', and the ''Masterpieces of African Art'' at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1954, (as well as shows in London&lt;ref&gt;The Sculptor [[Henry Moore]] singles out the Chiwara in a review of a 1951 London show. See Henry Moore. Tribal Sculpture: A Review of the Exhibition at the Imperial Institute.

It was founded in 1972 as The Clocktower Gallery by [[Alanna Heiss]], the Founder and former Director of [[MoMA PS1]] (formerly P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) under the aegis of the Institute for Art and Urban Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/55653/112-greene-street-the-soho-that-used-to-be/|title= 112 Greene Street: The Soho that Used to Be|publisher=Hyperallergic| author=Frances Richard |date=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|title= The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|publisher=books and ideas| author=Cristelle Terroni |date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 until 2013, the institution operated out of a City-owned McKim, Mead &amp; White building in Lower Manhattan, the [[former New York Life Insurance Company Building]].

==History==

Clocktower Productions is the organization formerly known as The Clocktower Gallery and ARTonAIR.org. Opening in 1972 with inaugural shows by [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Richard Tuttle]], and [[James Bishop (artist)|James Bishop]], the Clocktower presented work in the visual arts, performance, and music by artists including [[Gordon Matta-Clark]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Max Neuhaus]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Richard Artschwager]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[Laurie Anderson]], and [[Marina Abramović]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/fashion/the-spirit-of-youth-circa-1970-new-york.html | title= The Spirit of Youth, Circa 1970 New York | publisher=New York Times| author= Bob Morris |date= January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[September 11, 2001]], security procedures in the organization’s City-owned building suspended ongoing activity and exhibitions in the Clocktower. From 2004 until 2008, the Clocktower space operated as a satellite of P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1), housing the headquarters of Art Radio WPS1.org, the museum’s all-art Web-based radio station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/arts/art-radio-free-tribeca.html | title= ART; Radio Free TriBeCa | publisher=New York Times | author= Phoebe Hoban | date= May 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-20/nyc-life/adieu-bonjour/ | title= Adieu, Bonjour | publisher=New York Village Voice| author= Tricia Romano | date=April 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Alanna Heiss left P.S.1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://artdaily.com/news/28098/P-S-1-Contemporary-Art-Center-Founder-and-Director-Alanna-Heiss-to-Retire#.VE7y6efdBU8 | title= P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center Founder and Director Alanna Heiss to Retire | publisher=New York artdaily.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to the Clocktower Gallery in order to run the radio station full-time, renaming the organization AIR, Art International Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bombmagazine.org/article/4222/image-not-available-can-alanna-heiss-bring-art-to-the-airwaves | title= Image Not Available: Can Alanna Heiss Bring Art to the Airwaves? | publisher=New York artdaily.org | author=Jed Lipinski | date= June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, installations and artworks commissioned by AIR went on view in the Clocktower’s galleries and project spaces. Works by [[Tony Oursler]], [[Todd Eberle]], [[Mary Heilmann]] and Sabina Streeter reinaugurated the Clocktower Gallery's exhibition program.&lt;ref name="art:21, August 17, 2009"&gt;http://blog.art21.org/2009/08/17/weekly-roundup-15/&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 until 2013, the Clocktower Gallery produced exhibitions, residencies, and performances by artists including [[James Franco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/arts/design/20franco.html?pagewanted=all|title= When an Actor Casts Himself as an Artist |publisher=New York Times| author=Roberta Smith |date=August 19, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clocktower Radio==

The online radio station of Clocktower Productions was founded in 2004 as [[WPS1]]. In 2009, it was renamed AIR, Art International Radio after Director Alanna Heiss left P.S.1, and in 2014 it was renamed again after Clocktower’s relocation from its City building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10409420/The-best-internet-radio-stations.html | title= The 60 best internet radio stations | publisher= The Telegraph | author=Pete Naughton | date=26 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Wallis and Futuna''' consists of elements from the unofficial flag of [[Wallis and Futuna]] featuring a red [[saltire]] on a white square, which in turn is placed on a red field (alternatively, a larger white [[cross pattée]] is used). The cross is placed on the lower right; the flag of France outlined in white on two sides is in the upper left quadrant.&lt;ref name="ngw"&gt;[http://ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Wallis_et_Futuna Heraldry of the World: Wallis et Futuna]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbm"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jfrWCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA977&amp;lpg=PA977&amp;dq=coat+of+arms+of+wallis+and+futuna&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j-i-lAqyqH&amp;sig=OiPnqZnCyH5WKyIgB5QPn_G1W6c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwihpLHlm9fcAhUkKsAKHB James B Minahan, 2010: ''The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems'', vol 1, p 207 (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms, like the flag, is apparently unofficial.&lt;ref name="ngw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jbm" /&gt;

This is a comparison of [[Music video game#Rhythm games|dancing video game]] series in which players must step on panels on a [[dance pad]] in time with music. Step placement and timing is indicated by rising arrows overlapping fixed targets.

! [[Dance pad|Panels/pad]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The number of '''panels per pad''' refers to the number of inputs that are utilized in gameplay after the start of a song/level.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Modifiers&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''Modifiers''' are changes that can be made to modify the game's step routine that usually either increase or decrease difficulty. Such changes may consist of modifications to note scrolling speed, changes to the design or integrity of the notes, and alterations to note positioning.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Courses&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''Courses''', often termed "Marathon courses," are sets of multiple songs that are played back-to-back without intermediate rests for the player to select the next song. During course play, life meters for subsequent songs are often directly impacted by the life meters from the songs previously completed. Thus the second song in a course set may begin with the same life meter as the player remained with at the completion of the first song in the course. Courses are often constructed thematically.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Bombs&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''Bombs''' are notes that scroll onto the screen along with the note-markers that the player must avoid stepping on. Often, stepping on a bomb penalizes the player's dance gauge by having it reduced. In some games, derivative elements called "Attack Mines" or "Mod Bombs" may be used to trigger changes to the gameplay that the player might find distracting.&lt;/ref&gt;
! [[USB flash drive|USB Card]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''[[USB flash drive|USB card]]''' availability refers to the capacity of video game systems in the series (typically arcade systems) to read character or song data from an external removable USB drive.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hands==
"Hands" are unusual step charting features in which three or more arrows must be pressed at the same time. This is supposed to be accomplished via pressing two arrows with the feet and the extra arrows with the player's hands, hence the name "hands". Using carefully positioned feet to hit multiple arrows at once is also acceptable.

*'''Dance Dance Revolution''': No hands officially. A single song in [[Dancing Stage 1.5]] (Uh La La La Maniac Single) features one hand due to an oversight, a single song in ''Ultramix 2'' (Skulk Challenge Single) features at least one hand but the chart is unused and inaccessible without hacking the game, and four songs in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000|Solo 2000]]''{{fact|date=April 2018}} feature at least one hand. Hands are also disallowed in Edit Mode, though a glitch can circumvent this{{fact|date=April 2018}}.
*'''Dance Praise''': No hands officially, although some songs feature glitches that require three or four panels to be pressed simultaneously.
*'''In The Groove''': Yes.  Up to six panels must be pressed at once.  It is worth noting that on machines which were converted from DDR to ITG, it is usually more difficult to hit hands because one must apply much more pressure to get steps to register; this is because DDR cabinets were not originally designed with hand play in mind.
*'''Pump It Up''': Yes. In Five-Panel (Singles) songs above the level 13, to press three arrows at once (Triples) is fairly common, albeit often done with the heel rather than a hand. In Ten-Panel songs (Doubles) above the level 17, to press four arrows at once (Quads) is not uncommon, but once again, hands are often not involved. In some boss songs, you might have to press five (singles) or six (doubles) arrows at once, in which case you do have to use the hands, but more than this (eight or ten) has been mostly discontinued (except for some boss missions and gimmick "another" charts)
*'''Pump It Up Pro''': Yes.  Up to six panels must be pressed at once.

'''Contemporary ballet''' is a genre of [[dance]] that incorporates elements of [[classical ballet]] and [[modern dance]].&lt;ref name="washington ballet"&gt;{{cite web|title=ballet 101|url=http://www.washingtonballet.org/news-media/ballet-101/|website=the washington ballet|publisher=The Washington Ballet|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs classical [[ballet technique]] and in many cases classical [[pointe technique]] as well, but allows greater range of movement of the upper body and is not constrained to the rigorously defined body lines and forms found in traditional, classical ballet. Many of its attributes come from the ideas and innovations of 20th-century modern dance, including [[floor work]] and [[turn-in (dance)|turn-in]] of the legs.

==History==
[[File:G. Balanchine (young).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[George Balanchine]], a contemporary ballet pioneer]]
[[George Balanchine]]  is often considered to have been the first pioneer of contemporary ballet. However, the true origin of contemporary ballet is credited to Russian art producer Serge Diaghilev. Diaghilev wanted to bring an understanding of the arts to the general public. He created a program that combined all forms of the arts (painting, music, theater, and art) to present to the public. When this program had success in Russia, Diaghilev was inspired to bring it to a European audience by creating a new spin on classical ballet. He created Diaghilev's Russian Ballet Company, debuting the first show in 1909. However, Diaghilev was not a choreographer, he entrusted the evolvement of his creation to several well-known choreographers, one of them being George Balanchine. 

The style of dance Balanchine developed, which lies between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet, is known by today's standards as [[neoclassical ballet]]. He used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-traditional costumes, such as leotards, tunics and "powder puff" tutus&lt;ref name="dance magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Looseleaf|first1=Victoria|title=The story of the tutu|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/October-2007/The-Story-of-the-Tutu|website=Dance magazine|publisher=DanceMedia, LLC|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of "pancake" tutus, to distance his work from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine invited modern dance performers such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] in to dance with his company, the [[New York City Ballet]], and he worked with modern dance choreographer [[Martha Graham]],&lt;ref name="paul taylor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Taylor Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-taylor-41059#synopsis|website=bio.|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC.|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which expanded his exposure to modern techniques and ideas.&lt;ref name="washington ballet" /&gt; During this period, other choreographers such as John Butler and [[Glen Tetley]] began to consciously combine ballet and modern techniques in experimentation.

== Choreographers ==
One dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neoclassical style was [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably [[Twyla Tharp]].&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Terry|title=The history and style of contemporary ballet|url=https://suite.io/terry-finch/1th62sd|website=Terry Finch|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tharp choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976;&lt;ref name="tharp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Marcia|title=Twyla Tharp|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/tharp.html|website=Dance Heritage Coalition|publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 she created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of [[pointe shoes]] and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.

Tharp also worked with The [[Joffrey Ballet]], founded in 1957 by [[Robert Joffrey]]. She choreographed ''[[Deuce Coupe]]'' for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder [[Gerald Arpino]].&lt;ref name="brief history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of contemporary ballet|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/a-Brief-History-Of-Contemporary-Ballet-1687695.html|website=study mode|publisher=StudyMode.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable contemporary choreographers include [[Jorma Elo]], [[William Forsythe (choreographer)]], [[Mark Morris (choreographer)]], [[Jiri Kylian]], [[Alonzo King]], and [[Trey McIntyre]].

== Technique ==
[[File:Grace in winter, contemporary ballet.jpg|thumb|A contemporary ballet dancer]]
Contemporary ballet draws from both modern dance and classical ballet for its training methods and technique. For a dancer to be able to embody various styles the training regimen has become more diverse. In addition to classical technique, which often includes the signature speed and style of George Balanchine for American dancers, dancers study modern as well. In addition, many dancers do various forms of cross training. Pilates and yoga are often included to loosen muscles and align the body. Since the late 1920s, [[Pilates]] has been a popular form of cross training to help prevent injury, but increasingly, the [[Gyrotonic]] Expansion System is being utilized. With contemporary work, dancers' spines need to be more supple and they need to understand how to be grounded. This is in contrast to classical and neoclassical ballet where the dancers are required to "pull up" and the upper body is held. Dancers are required to first obtain classical ballet training in order to build on it with more modern technique in order to be more versatile. Despite formal training, dancers are often affected by ankle injuries, due to the high intensity footwork.

== Costumes ==
The costumes and footwear differ from any other style of dance as well. In contemporary ballet, dancers can be asked to wear pointe shoes, regular ballet shoes, or even no shoes at all. The same versatile approach goes for the music, setting, and costumes. Contemporary ballet does not require certain standards to be met. While it has more guidelines that modern dance, it does not conform to the limits of classical ballet. Classical ballet requires tutus, pointe shoes and scenery. Contemporary ballet uses different types of costumes, ranging from traditional to more modern tunic type versions. The music choices may vary as well. In Classical ballet, most often the choreography is done to classical music. In contemporary ballet, the music can range from the traditional classical music to popular music of today.

== Present Day ==
Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers all over the world. Notable companies include [[Nederlands Dans Theater]], [[Hubbard Street Dance Chicago]], [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]], and [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]]. Likewise, many traditionally "classical" companies also regularly perform contemporary works. Most classically trained dancers who may identify as professional ballet dancers are in fact required to be very versatile and able to perform work ranging from classical to neoclassical to contemporary ballet to modern dance. They are required to have impeccable ballet technique with a mastery of [[pointe technique]] for women, but at the same time, are being asked to be just as comfortable in ballet slippers or bare foot performing the work of modern choreographers such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)]] or embracing [[Gaga (dance vocabulary)]] in the work of [[Ohad Naharin]]. It is very common for ballet companies to have an official choreographer in residence to create new work—often contemporary—on the company. As well, many contemporary choreographers are commissioned to go to companies to create new work or a company will pay for the rights to perform already existing work and an official repetiteur will come to stage it. Twyla Tharp, as previously mentioned, is a highly renowned choreographer whose work is widely performed.

'''''Discworld''''' is a [[comic fantasy]] [[book series]] written by the English author [[Terry Pratchett]] (1948–2015), set on the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a [[Flat Earth|flat planet]] balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William Shakespeare]], as well as [[mythology]], [[folklore]] and [[fairy tales]], often using them for [[satirical]] parallels with cultural, political and scientific issues.

Forty-one ''Discworld'' novels have been published. The original British editions of the first 26 novels, up to ''[[Thief of Time]]'' (2001), had cover art by [[Josh Kirby]]. The American editions, published by [[Harper Collins]], used their own cover art. Since Kirby's death in 2001, the covers have been designed by [[Paul Kidby]]. Companion publications include eleven short stories (some only loosely related to the Discworld), four popular science books, and a number of supplementary books and reference guides. The series has been adapted for graphic novels, theatre, computer and board games, and television.

Newly released ''Discworld'' books regularly topped ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' best-sellers list, making Pratchett the UK's best-selling author in the 1990s. ''Discworld'' novels have also won awards such as the [[Prometheus Award]] and the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]]. In the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read|Big Read]], four ''Discworld'' novels were in the top 100, and a total of fourteen in the top 200. More than 80 million ''Discworld'' books have been sold in 37 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sir-Terry-Pratchett/e/B000AQ0NN8|title=Sir Terry Pratchett|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/terryandrob/status/404576508649701376|title=Terry and Rob|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Very few of the ''Discworld'' novels have chapter divisions. Instead they feature interweaving storylines. Pratchett was quoted as saying that he "just never got into the habit of chapters",&lt;ref name="afp92"&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title= Chapters |author=Terry Pratchett|authorlink=Terry Pratchett|date=30 July 1992 |newsgroup= alt.fan.pratchett |message-id= memo.550062@cix.compulink.co.uk |url= https://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.pratchett/msg/458d0849777faf48?dmode=source |accessdate=9 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later adding that "I have to shove them in the putative YA books because my editor screams until I do".&lt;ref name="afp93"&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title= Re: Posting to TP |author=Terry Pratchett|authorlink=Terry Pratchett|date=26 September 1993 |newsgroup= alt.fan.pratchett |message-id= 749073107snz@unseen.demon.co.uk |url= https://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.pratchett/msg/3b119fcb1984cb53?dmode=source |accessdate=9 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first ''Discworld'' novel ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'' was divided into "books", as is ''[[Pyramids (Discworld)|Pyramids]]''. Additionally, ''[[Going Postal]]'' and ''[[Making Money]]'' both have chapters, a prologue, an epilogue, and brief teasers of what is to come in each chapter, in the style of [[A. A. Milne]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Jerome K. Jerome]].

== Themes and motifs ==
The ''Discworld'' novels contain common themes and motifs that run through the series. Fantasy clichés are parodied in many of the novels, as are various subgenres of fantasy, such as [[fairy tale]]s (notably ''[[Witches Abroad]]''), witch and vampire stories (''[[Carpe Jugulum]]'') and so on. Analogies of real-world issues, such as religion (''[[Small Gods]]''), fundamentalism and inner city tension (''[[Thud!|Thud]]''), business and politics (''[[Making Money]]''), racial prejudice and exploitation (''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'') are recurring themes, as are aspects of culture and entertainment, such as opera (''[[Maskerade]]''), rock music (''[[Soul Music (novel)|Soul Music]]''), cinema (''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]''), and football (''[[Unseen Academicals]]''). Parodies of non-Discworld fiction also occur frequently, including [[Shakespeare]], [[Beatrix Potter]], and several movies. Major historical events, especially battles, are sometimes used as the basis for both trivial and key events in ''Discworld'' stories (''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', ''[[Pyramids (novel)|Pyramids]]''), as are trends in science, technology, pop culture and modern art (''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'', ''[[Men at Arms]]'', ''[[Thud!|Thud]]''). There are also humanist themes in many of the Discworld novels, and a focus on critical thinking skills in the Witches and Tiffany Aching series.

== Storylines ==
[[File:Discworld Reading Order Guide 3.0 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|A visual overview of how the ''Discworld'' books relate to each other]]
The ''Discworld'' novels and stories are, in principle, stand-alone works. However, a number of novels and stories form [[novel sequence]]s with distinct [[story arc]]s:

=== Rincewind ===
{{Main|Rincewind}}

[[Rincewind]] was the first protagonist of ''Discworld''; a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no interest in heroics. He is the archetypal coward but is constantly thrust into extremely dangerous adventures. In ''The Last Hero'', he flatly states that he does ''not'' wish to join an expedition to explore over the edge of the Disc—but, being fully geared for the expedition at the time, clarifies by saying that any amount of protesting on his part is futile, as something will eventually occur that will bring him into the expedition anyway. As such, he not only constantly succeeds in staying alive, but also saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on [[Roundworld]] ([[Science of Discworld]]).

Other characters in the Rincewind story arc include: [[Cohen the Barbarian]], an aging hero of the old fantasy tradition, out of touch with the modern world and still fighting despite his advanced age; [[Twoflower]], a naive tourist from the [[Agatean Empire]] (inspired by cultures of the Far East, particularly Japan and China); and [[The Luggage]], a magical, semi-sentient and exceptionally vicious multi-legged travelling accessory, made from [[sapient pearwood]]. Rincewind appeared in eight Discworld novels as well as the four [[Science of Discworld]] supplementary books.

=== Death ===
{{Main|Death (Discworld)|Susan Sto Helit}}
[[Death (Discworld)|Death]] appears in every novel except ''[[The Wee Free Men]]'' and ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', although sometimes with only a few lines. As dictated by tradition, he is a seven-foot-tall [[Grim Reaper|skeleton in a black robe]] who sits astride a pale horse (called Binky). His dialogue is always depicted in {{smallcaps|[[small caps]]}}, and without quotation marks, as several characters state that Death's voice seems to arrive in their heads without actually passing through their ears as sound.

As the [[Anthropomorphic personifications (Discworld)|anthropomorphic personification]] of death, Death has the job of guiding souls onward from this world into the next. Over millennia in the role, he has developed a fascination with humanity, even going so far as to create a house for himself in his personal dimension.

Characters that often appear with Death include his butler [[Albert (Discworld)|Albert]]; his granddaughter [[Susan Sto Helit]]; the [[Death of Rats]], the part of Death in charge of gathering the souls of rodents; [[Quoth (Discworld)|Quoth]], a talking raven (a parody of Edgar Allan Poe's "[[The Raven]]", although it flat-out refuses to say "Nevermore"); and the [[Auditors of Reality]], personifications of the orderly [[physical law]]s and the closest thing Death has to a nemesis. Death or Susan appear as the main characters in five Discworld novels. He also appears in the short stories ''[[Death and What Comes Next]]'', ''[[Theatre of Cruelty (Discworld)|Theatre of Cruelty]]'' and ''[[Turntables of the Night]]''.

Death also appears in the non-Discworld novel ''[[Good Omens]]'', written by Pratchett and [[Neil Gaiman]].

In Soul Music, when asked about things he enjoys he answers, "Cats and curries".

=== Witches ===
{{Main|Witches (Discworld)}}

[[Witches (Discworld)|Witches]] in Pratchett's universe are largely stripped of their modern occultist associations (though Pratchett does frequently use his stories to lampoon such conceptions of witchcraft), and act as [[herbalist]]s, adjudicators and wise women. That is not to say that witches on the Disc cannot use [[Discworld magic|magic]]; they simply prefer not to, finding simple but cunningly applied psychology (often referred to as "headology", or sometimes "boffo") far more effective.

The principal witch in the series is [[Granny Weatherwax]], who at first glance seems to be a taciturn, bitter old crone, from the small mountain country of [[Lancre]]. She largely despises people but takes on the role of their healer and protector because no one else can do the job as well as she can. Her closest friend is [[Nanny Ogg]], a jolly, personable witch with the "common touch" who enjoys a smoke and a pint of beer, often leading to her singing bawdy folk songs including the notorious "Hedgehog Song". The two take on apprentice witches, initially [[Magrat Garlick]], then [[Agnes Nitt]], and then [[Tiffany Aching]], who in turn go on to become accomplished witches in their own right, and, in Magrat's case, Queen of Lancre.

Other characters in the Witches series include: King [[Verence II of Lancre]], a onetime [[jester|Fool]]; [[Jason Ogg]], Nanny Ogg's eldest son and local blacksmith; [[Shawn Ogg]], Nanny's youngest son who serves as his country's entire army and civil service; and Nanny's murderous cat [[Greebo]]. The witches have appeared in numerous Discworld books, but have featured as protagonists in seven. They have also appeared in the short story "[[The Sea and Little Fishes]]". Their stories frequently draw on ancient European folklore and fairy tales, as well as parody famous works of literature, particularly by [[Shakespeare]].

=== City Watch ===
{{Main|Ankh-Morpork City Watch}}

The stories featuring the [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch]] are [[urban fantasy]], and frequently show the clashes that result when a traditional, magically run fantasy world such as the Disc comes into contact with modern technology and civilization. They revolve around the growth of the [[Ankh-Morpork]] City Watch from a hopeless gang of three to a fully equipped and efficient police force. The stories are largely [[police procedural]]s, featuring crimes that have heavy political or societal overtones.

The main character is [[Sam Vimes]], a haggard, cynical, working-class street copper who, when introduced in ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'', is the drunken/alcoholic Captain of the 2-person Night Watch: lazy, cowardly, and none-too-bright Sergeant [[Fred Colon]], and Corporal [[Nobby Nobbs]], a petty thief in his own right. Then [[Carrot Ironfoundersson]], a 6-foot-6-inch-tall (1.98 m) dwarf-by-adoption, comes down from the mountains to join the Watch and do real policing. The Night Watch manages to save the city from a dragon, we learn that Carrot is possibly the rightful heir to the throne of Ankh-Morpork, and the Patrician decides to allow Vimes to create a real police force.

Other main characters include [[Captain Angua von Überwald|Angua]], a werewolf; [[Detritus (Discworld)|Detritus]], a troll; Reg Shoe, a zombie and Dead Rights campaigner; Cuddy, a [[Dwarfs (Discworld)|Dwarf]] who appears in ''[[Men at Arms]]''; Golem Constable Dorfl; [[Cheery Littlebottom]], the Watch's [[forensics]] expert, who is one of the first dwarves to be openly female (and who tried to rename herself "Cheri", but without success); Sam's wife, [[Lady Sybil Vimes|Lady Sybil Vimes (née Ramkin)]]; Constable Visit-the-infidel-with-explanatory-pamphlets; [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Inspector A E Pessimal|Inspector A E Pessimal]], recruited by Vimes as his adjutant when sent as an auditor by [[Havelock Vetinari]], the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork. The City Watch have starred in eight Discworld stories, and have cameoed in a number of others, including ''[[Making Money]]'', the children's book ''[[Where's My Cow?]],'' and the short story "[[Theatre of Cruelty (Discworld)|Theatre of Cruelty]]".

Pratchett stated on numerous occasions that the presence of the City Watch makes Ankh-Morpork stories 'problematic', as stories set in the city that do not directly involve Vimes and the Watch often ''require'' a Watch presence to maintain the story—at which point, it becomes a Watch story by default.

=== Wizards ===
{{Main|Unseen University}}

The Wizards of the [[Unseen University]] (UU) have represented a strong thread through many of the ''Discworld'' novels, although the only books that they star in exclusively are The Science of the Discworld series and the novels ''[[Unseen Academicals]]'' and ''[[The Last Continent]]''. In the early books, the faculty of UU changed frequently, as rising to the top usually involved assassination. However, with the ascension of the bombastic [[Mustrum Ridcully]] to the position of [[Archchancellor (Discworld)|Archchancellor]], the hierarchy has settled and characters have been given the chance to develop. The earlier books featuring the wizards also frequently dealt with the possible invasion of the Discworld by the creatures from the [[Dungeon Dimensions]], Lovecraftian monsters that hunger for the magic and potential of the Discworld.

The wizards of UU employ the traditional "whizz-bang" type of magic seen in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' games, but also investigate the rules and structure of magic in terms highly reminiscent of [[particle physics]]. Prominent members include [[Ponder Stibbons]], a geeky young wizard; [[Hex (Discworld)|Hex]], the Disc's first computer/semi-sentient thinking engine; [[Librarian (Discworld)|the Librarian]], who was turned into an [[orangutan]] by magical accident; the Dean; the [[The Bursar|Bursar]]; the Chair of Indefinite Studies; the Lecturer in Recent Runes; and the Senior Wrangler. In later novels, Rincewind also joins their group, while the Dean leaves to become the Archchancellor of Brazeneck College in the nearby city of Pseudopolis.

The Wizards have featured prominently in nine ''Discworld'' books as well as starred in The Science of Discworld series and the short story "[[A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices]]".

=== Tiffany Aching ===
{{Main|Tiffany Aching}}

[[Tiffany Aching]] is a young apprentice witch and protagonist of a series of Discworld books aimed at young adults. Her stories often parallel mythic heroes' quests, but also deal with Tiffany's difficulties as a young girl maturing into a responsible woman. She is aided in her task by the [[Nac Mac Feegle]], a gang of blue-tattooed, 6-inch tall, hard-drinking, loud-mouthed pictsie creatures also called "The Wee Free Men" who serve as her guardians. Both [[Granny Weatherwax]] and [[Nanny Ogg]] have also appeared in her stories. She has appeared in five novels (''[[The Wee Free Men]]'', ''[[A Hat Full of Sky]]'', ''[[Wintersmith]]'', ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]'', and ''[[The Shepherd's Crown]]''). Major characters in this series include Miss Tick, who discovered Tiffany, Annagramma Hawkin, Petulia Gristle, and Nac Mac Feegle chieftain Rob Anybody.

=== Moist von Lipwig ===
{{Main|Moist von Lipwig}}

[[Moist von Lipwig]] is a professional criminal and con man to whom Havelock Vetinari gives a "second chance" after staging his execution, recognising the advantages his [[jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]] abilities would have to the development of the city. After setting him in charge of the [[Ankh-Morpork Post Office]] in ''[[Going Postal]]'', to good result, Vetinari ordered him to clear up the city's corrupt financial sector in ''[[Making Money]]''. In a third book, ''[[Raising Steam]]'', published on 7 November 2013, Vetinari persuades Lipwig to oversee the development of a rail network for Dick Simnel's newly invented steam locomotive. Other characters in this series include [[Adora Belle Dearheart]], Lipwig's acerbic, chain-smoking love interest; [[Golems (Discworld)#Gladys|Gladys]], a golem who develops a strange crush on Lipwig; [[Stanley Howler]], an obsessive young man who was raised by peas and becomes the Disc's first [[stamp collector]]; and the very old Junior Postman Groat, who never got promoted to Senior Postman because there was never a Postmaster alive long enough to do so.

=== ''Discworld'' cultures ===
Several other books can be grouped together as "Other cultures of Discworld" books. They may contain characters or locations from other arcs, typically not as protagonist or antagonist but as a supporting character or even a throwaway reference. These include [[Pyramids (novel)|''Pyramids'']] (Djelibeybi), ''[[Small Gods]]'' (Omnia), and [[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|''Monstrous Regiment'']] (Zlobenia and Borogravia).

=== Short stories ===
There are also a number of short stories by Pratchett based in the Discworld, including published miscellanea such as the fictional game origins of ''[[Thud (game)|Thud]]''. All are available in the anthology ''[[A Blink of the Screen]]'' (2012) as well as in the following locations:

* "[[Troll Bridge]]" – in ''After The King: Stories in honour of J. R. R. Tolkien'' (1992); reprinted in ''The Mammoth Book of Comic Fantasy'' edited by [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] (1998); available online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/bookdepository/stories/pratchett/trollbridge/trollbridgetext.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309210610/http://members.fortunecity.com/bookdepository/stories/pratchett/trollbridge/trollbridgetext.html |archivedate=2012-03-09 |title=Troll Bridge |publisher=Members.fortunecity.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "[[The Sea and Little Fishes]]" – in ''[[Legends (book)|Legends]]'' (1998), anthology of novellas taking place within popular fantasy cycles edited by [[Robert Silverberg]]

* "[[A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices]]" (2005) – first published in the May 13th, 2005 issue of ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]'';{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} included in certain editions of ''Snuff'';{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} available online&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/a-collegiate-casting-out-of-devilish-devices/195991.article|title=A collegiate casting-out of devilish devices|date=13 May 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven of the short stories or short writings were also collected in a compilation of the majority of Pratchett's known short work named ''[[Once More* With Footnotes]]'' (2004).

Additionally, another short story "[[Turntables of the Night]]" (1989) is set in England but features [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] as a character; it is available online and in both anthologies.

=== "Mapps" ===
Although Terry Pratchett said, "There are no maps. You can't map a sense of humour,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kehe|first1=Jason|title=Remembering Terry Pratchett, a Fantasy Icon|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/rip-terry-pratchett/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are four "Mapps": ''[[The Streets of Ankh-Morpork]]'' (1993), ''[[The Discworld Mapp]]'' (1995), ''[[A Tourist Guide to Lancre]]'' (1998), and ''[[Death's Domain]]'' (1999). The first two were drawn by Stephen Player, based on plans by Pratchett and [[Stephen Briggs]], the third is a collaboration between Briggs and Kidby, and the last is by [[Paul Kidby]]. All also contain booklets written by Pratchett and Briggs.

=== Science books ===
Pratchett also collaborated with [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] on four books, using the Discworld to illuminate [[popular science]] topics. Each book alternates chapters of a ''Discworld'' story and notes on real science related to it. The books are:

* ''[[The Science of Discworld]]'' (1999)
* ''[[The Science of Discworld II: The Globe]]'' (2002)
* ''[[The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch]]'' (2005)
* ''[[The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day]]'' (2013)

=== Quiz books ===
[[David Langford]] has compiled two ''Discworld'' [[quiz]] books:

* ''[[The Unseen University Challenge]]'' (1996), parodying the TV quiz show ''[[University Challenge]]''
* ''The Wyrdest Link'' (2002), parodying the TV quiz show ''[[The Weakest Link]]''

=== Diaries ===
{{Main|Discworld Diary}}

Most years see the release of a Discworld Diary and Discworld Calendar, both usually following a particular theme.

The diaries feature background information about their themes. Some topics are later used in the series; the character of Miss Alice Band first appeared in the ''Assassins' Guild Yearbook'', for example.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

''[[The Discworld Almanak|The Discworld Almanak – The Year of The Prawn]]'' has a similar format and general contents to the diaries.

=== Other books ===
Other ''Discworld'' publications include:

* ''[[The Josh Kirby Discworld Portfolio]]'' (1993) A collection of Josh Kirby's artwork, published by Paper Tiger.
* ''[[The Discworld Companion]]'' (1994) An encyclopaedia of ''Discworld'' information, compiled by Pratchett and Briggs. An updated version was released in 2003, titled ''The New Discworld Companion''. A further updated version was released in 2012, titled ''Turtle Recall: The Discworld Companion . . .

== Reading order ==
The books take place roughly in [[real-time (media)|real time]] and the characters' ages change to reflect the passing of years. The meetings of various characters from different narrative threads (e.g., Ridcully and [[Granny Weatherwax]] in ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', Rincewind and Carrot in ''[[The Last Hero]]'') indicate that all the main storylines take place around the same period (end of the Century of the Fruitbat, beginning of the Century of the Anchovy).  The main exception is the stand-alone book ''[[Small Gods]]'', which appears to take place at some point earlier than most of the other stories, though even this contains cameo appearances by Death and the Librarian.

Some main characters may make [[cameo appearance]]s in other books where they are not the primary focus; for example, City Watch members [[Carrot Ironfoundersson]] and [[Captain Angua von Überwald|Angua]] appear briefly in ''[[Going Postal]]'', ''[[Making Money]]'', and ''[[Unseen Academicals]]'' (placing those books after ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' and ''[[Men at Arms]]''). A number of characters, such as members of staff of [[Unseen University]] and Lord Vetinari, appear prominently in many different storylines without having specific storylines of their own.

==Continuation==
After Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], he said that he would be happy for his daughter [[Rhianna Pratchett|Rhianna]] to continue the series.&lt;ref name="newstatesman 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/terry-pratchett-my-daughter-rhianna-will-take-over-discworld-when-im-gone|title=Terry Pratchett: My daughter Rhianna will take over the Discworld when I'm gone|date=14 November 2012|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhianna Pratchett said that she would only be involved in spin-offs, adaptations and tie-ins, and that there would be no more novels.&lt;ref name="newstatesman 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/terry-pratchett-discworld-series-comes-to-an-end-as-daughter-rhianna-rules-out-future-books-10312426.html|title=Terry Pratchett's ''Discworld'' series is definitely over as daughter Rhianna rules out future books|date=12 June 2015|publisher=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
Due in part to the complexity of the novels, ''Discworld'' has been difficult to adapt to film&amp;nbsp;– Pratchett was fond of an anecdote of a producer attempting to pitch an adaptation of ''[[Mort]]'' in the early 1990s but was told to "lose the Death angle" by US backers.&lt;ref name=afp-mort&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title= DW Film...

'''''Friday Black''''' is the 2018 debut book by author Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah. Set in a [[Dystopia|dystopian]] near-future of twisted prosaic settings, the collection of short stories explores themes surrounding [[Black people|black identity]] as it relates to a range of contemporary [[Social issue|social issues]]. The book enjoyed an overall positive reception, including the naming of Adjei-Brenyah as one of the "5 Under 35 Authors" for 2018, by the [[National Book Foundation]].

==Overview==
''Friday Black'' takes its title from the consumer holiday [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], which takes place in the US on the Friday following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alter |first1=Alexandra |title='Friday Black' Uses Fantasy and Blistering Satire to Skewer Racism and Consumer Culture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/books/friday-black-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah-debut-collection.html |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of dystopian near-future short stories, the book's titular work follows its protagonist in the form of a [[department store]] salesman, as he copes with "vicious, insatiable Black Friday shoppers," while attempting to win a sales contest among employees, in order to give the prize jacket to his mother as a gift.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pw1"&gt;{{cite web |title=PW Picks: Books of the Week, October 22, 2018 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/78365-pw-picks-books-of-the-week-october-22-2018.html |website=''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively the opening piece, "The Finkelstein 5", concerns Emmanuel, who can "dial his blackness" up or down depending on his situation: down to 1.5 for an interview with a prospective employer, comfortably at 4.0 with the aid of a necktie and wing-tipped shoes, and up to 10 when his sense of vengeance bursts forth at a demonstration over the killing of five black children by a chainsaw wielding white man.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hong |first1=Fernanda |title=Review: Friday Black by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah |url=http://columbiajournal.org/review-friday-black-by-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah/ |website=''[[Columbia Journal]]'' |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work continues to explore a range of topics, from issues of [[race in the United States criminal justice system]], to the plight of a teenager working to support their family after their father's disappearance, [[school shootings]], and "a dystopian [[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]] in which victims of an unexplained weapon relive a single day and resort to extreme violence to cope".&lt;ref name="pw1"/&gt; In "Through the Flash", the black protagonist struggles to change the narrative in a theme park where mostly white patrons savagely relish their racial prejudices under the guise of "problem-solving, judgement and justice," while "The Era" presents a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] landscape where self-confidence comes only through the use of drugs.&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Friday Black |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah/friday-black/ |website=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Adjei-Brenyah has said that as he set out to write what would eventually become his book ''Friday Black'' he sought to use a form of "magical realism" as a tool for exploring issues such as "race and the depravities of consumer culture and our collective habituation to violence."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Speaking to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' Adjei-Brenyah reflected, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I like to work in that space where, "Is it hyperbole? I don't know." When you kill someone with a gun or a chainsaw, they're just as dead either way. When I say 'chainsaw,' you have to pay attention.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gamerman |first1=Ellen |title=In 'Friday Black,' Retail Is Bloody and the World Is Ending |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-friday-black-retail-is-bloody-and-the-world-is-ending-1540215831 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' |date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the ''New York Times'' observed, these narratives take place in "prosaic settings", such as malls, hospitals or residential areas, but which are rendered "unfamiliar by adding a surreal, disorienting twist," and employed in the exploration of contemporary issues such as abortion, racism, commercialism, and [[Cycle of violence|cyclical violence]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Throughout, the book variously explores the theme of black experience, in a way that works primarily to inspire "empathy for the marginalized and the feared".&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;

==Reception==
The book received generally favorable reviews. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Book Marks]] reported that 75% of critics gave the book a "rave" review, whilst the other 25% of the critics expressed "positive" impressions, based on a sample of 12 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday Black|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/friday-black/|work=[[Book Marks]]|access-date=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' along with the ''[[New York Post]]'' listed ''Friday Black'' as one of the best books of the week.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web |title=The best books of the week |url=https://nypost.com/2018/10/20/the-best-books-of-the-week-6/ |website=''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dawson |first1=Mackenzie |title=The best books of the week |url=https://nypost.com/2018/10/20/the-best-books-of-the-week-6/ |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' |date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Buzzfeed]]'' and ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' both named it among the top releases of Fall 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rebolini |first1=Arianna |title=These Are The Best Books Of Fall 2018 |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ariannarebolini/best-books-fall-2018-fiction-nonfiction-poetry |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[Buzzfeed]]'' |date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fallon |first1=Claire |title=Here Are 34 Fall 2018 Books We Can't Wait To Read |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/34-fall-2018-books_us_5b89976de4b0cf7b0035cedb |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily student newspaper ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' gave it 4.5 out of five stars, calling the book "an ingenious attack on American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bao |first1=Jenna X. |title='Friday Black:' An Ingenious Attack on American Society |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/16/friday-black-review/ |website=''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the book as a work where "edgy humor and fierce imagery coexist ... with shrewd characterization and humane intelligence, inspired by volatile material sliced off the front pages,"&lt;ref name="kirk"/&gt; while ''[[Newsday]]'' praised it as "caustically inventive", with a pervasive anger communicated through "nuance, grace and a probing empathy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seymour |first1=Gene |title='Friday Black' review: Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah's stories of race, retail are audaciously topical |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/books/friday-black-nana-kwame-adeji-brenyah-review-1.21978178 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[Newsday]]'' |date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[George Saunders]] dubbed the work as "an excitement and a wonder: strange, crazed, urgent and funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=October Preview: The Millions Most Anticipated (This Month) |url=https://themillions.com/2018/10/october-preview-the-millions-most-anticipated-this-month.html |website=''[[The Millions]]'' |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to ''Friday Black'', the National Book Foundation named Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah among their "5 Under 35 Authors" for 2018, chosen by author [[Colson Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2018 5 Under 35 Authors Announced |url=https://themillions.com/2018/09/2018-5-under-35-authors-announced.html |website=[[The Millions]] |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Charles |first1=Ron |authorlink1=Ron Charles (critic) |title=The National Book Foundation singles out the five best young writers in America |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-national-book-foundation-singles-out-the-five-best-young-writers-in-america/2018/09/23/4ad15f84-bab5-11e8-bdc0-90f81cc58c5d_story.html?utm_term=.a59c9000380d |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was included on the long list for the [[Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence in Fiction and Nonfiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence: Longlist 2019 |url=http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/carnegieadult/longlists |website=[[American Library Association]] |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gecko''' is an internationally touring physical theatre company, founded in 2001, and led by Artistic Director Amit Lahav.

== Overview ==
The style of the company was influenced primarily by the work of [[Lindsay Kemp]] and David Glass.

With an expanding ensemble of international performers and makers, Gecko creates work through collaboration, experimentation and play, in order to create a universal language through movement and dance.

The style is often referred to as 'Total Theatre', which Lahav describes as utilising any means possible to tell a story, including the creative deployment of puppets, props, physicality, language, music, lighting, multimedia and soundscapes to construct a complete theatrical world from these individual components. Through the ensemble's collaboration and the audience's engagement, each show continually evolves throughout their numerous stages of development.

The company tours nationally and internationally, developing strong partnerships around the world. 

Beyond the stage, Gecko aspires to open the doors on their process via every possible avenue, be it digital, in schools or through one-to-one relationships with their audience.

The '''Museum of Gold''' ({{lang-es|El Museo del Oro}}) is a [[museum]] located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. It is one of the most visited touristic highlights in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bogotatravelguide.com/places-to-go-in-bogota/gold-museum.php | title=The 22 Places To Go in Bogotá: Museum of Gold | publisher=Bogotá Travel Guide] | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum receives around 500,000 tourists per year.&lt;ref name=SemanaMuseo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/cultura/articulo/los-75-del-museo-del-oro/409766-3 Los 75 del Museo del Oro] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum displays a selection of [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] gold and other metal alloys, such as ''[[Tumbaga]]'', and contains the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world in its exhibition rooms on the second and third floors. Together with [[pottery]], stone, [[Animal shell|shell]], wood and textile objects, these items, made of a– to [[amerindian|indigenous]] cultures – sacred metal, testify to the life and thought of the different societies which lived in present-day Colombia before the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas]].

== History ==
In 1934, the [[Bank of the Republic]] began helping to protect the [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[National patrimony|patrimony]] of [[Colombia]].{{fact|date=January 2014}} The object known as [[Poporo Quimbaya]] was the first one in a collection. It has been on exhibition for 70 years.{{when|date=January 2014}}  The Museum is today administered by [[Bank_of_the_Republic_(Colombia)#Banrepcultural|Banrepcultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Banrepcultural |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/en |website=Red Cultural del Banco de la República en Colombia |accessdate=13 September 2018 |quote=The cultural activity of Banco de la República extends as a network through 29 cities in the Colombian territory, and is carried out in the Gold Museum in Bogota, five Gold Museums in Armenia, Cali, Cartagena, Pasto and Santa Marta, the Ethnographic Museum in Leticia, the Luis Ángel Arango Library and the Casa Gómez Campuzano in Bogotá, the Library Network that extends through 28 Colombian cities, the Luis Ángel Arango Library Concert Hall, and Bogotá museums: Casa de Moneda, Botero Museum and, Miguel Urrutia Museum of Art (MAMU).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses the famous [[Muisca raft|Muisca golden raft]] found in [[Pasca]] in 1969, that represents the ceremony of the new ''[[zipa]]'' (ruler) of Bacatá, the basis for the ''[[El Dorado]]'' myth. The heir to the chieftaincy assumed power with a great offering to the gods. In this representation he is seen standing at the centre of a raft, surrounded by the principal chieftains, all of them adorned with [[gold]] and feathers.

After a decade of work, the museum was expanded and renovated in October 2008. With the renovation, the museum organized the permanent exhibition in five rooms with archaeological objects and an interactive room. It also added an auditorium, some temporary exhibitions rooms, a cafe, a restaurant, and a souvenir store.

== Description ==
The museum has a collection of 55,000 pieces, 6,000 of which are on display in their expanded building. There are bilingual descriptions of almost all exhibits. On the first floor houses the museum's main entrance, a shop, and a restaurant.

Exhibitions begin on the second floor. The main room is called "People and Gold in pre-Hispanic [[Colombia]]". In glass vitrines display goldsmiths' work from the different cultures which inhabited Colombia before the Spanish colonists arrived. The permanent exhibition is divided into different halls for every culture: [[Calima culture|Calima]], [[Quimbaya]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Zenú]], [[Tierradentro]], [[San Agustín Archaeological Park|San Agustín]], [[Panche people|Tolima]], [[Tairona]], and Urabá, and a special room called "After [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]" (''Después de Colón'').

The exposition continues on the third floor, with "The Flying Chamanic" and "The Offering." The first shows the process of a [[shaman]]ic ceremony with its different gold pieces, the second is divided into three parts: the "Offering Room", the "Offering Boat", and the "Lake".

At the end of the exposition, there is a "Profunditation Room" with artistic videos about the most important gold pieces of the museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9137">'''Havel's Place''' is a public art project, which creates a series of memorial places dedicated to the last [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|president of Czechoslovakia]] and [[List of Presidents of the Czech Republic|the first president]] of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Václav Havel]]. The installation consists of two garden chairs around a round table, usually with a tree going through its middle. The rim of the table has the Havel Quote 'truth and love shall prevail over lies and hatred' inscribed along its rim. 

==Origins==
The original idea for Havel's Place came from [[Petr Gandalovič]], the [[Czech Ambassador to the United States]]. He invited [[Bořek Šípek]], an architect and designer, to create a piece of public art to represent Havel and his democratic views. Šípek had overseen a decade-long renovation of the interior of [[Prague Castle]] as President Havel's Head Architect in the 1990s, and made a number of artworks for his close friend. In the 2008 documentary about Havel, ''Citizen Havel'', by [[Pavel Koutecký]] and Miroslav Janek, the President stated that he would like people to subconsciously connect his person with Bořek Šípek's design and art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qubx6bsixOI&lt;/ref&gt;

Šípek came up with a design symbolising "Democratic Debate", comprising two metal garden chairs placed around a table around a [[linden tree]], the national tree of the [[Czech Republic]]. His idea was to create a gathering place in a public space to promote dialogue, discussion and freedom of speech. Bořek Šípek named the installation "Democracy Talks" and described it as "a place where people can meet and exercise their freedom of speech in a democratic dialogue with others".

[[Tomáš Halík]], a close friend of Havel, told [[Czech Radio]] on 5 October 2013 that "the bench with the two chairs symbolises the willingness to sit down at a table and talk. That is, in my opinion, another important message left by Václav Havel: Even as people of different opinions, different political beliefs and different religions, it is still immensely important to sit down at a table and talk to one another in search for the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=5 October 2013|title=Halík: Je dobře, že je to lavička, a ne bronzová socha...|accessdate=29 March 2017|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/nabozenstvi/krestanskytydenik/_zprava/halik-je-dobre-ze-je-to-lavicka-a-ne-bronzova-socha--1264792|language=Czech|website=[[Czech Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Havel's Place was installed in the grounds of [[Georgetown University]] in Washington D.C on 2 October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/news/vaclav-havel-dedication.html|title=Georgetown Dedicates Memorial to the Late Václav Havel|website=Georgetown University|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of [[Georgetown University]], [[Embassy of the Czech Republic in Washington, D.C.|the Czech Embassy]], [[Václav Havel Library]] and American Friends of Czech Republic. It was dedicated by former U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Dagmar Havlová]], Havel's widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=Fox News|first=Fred|last=Malek|title=Honoring Václav Havel - a man who should inspire all Americans|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/02/honoring-vaclav-havel-man-who-should-inspire-all-americans/|date=2 October 2013|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in Prague a few days after the installation of the Havel's Place bench in Georgetown, Sipek met with Art for Amnesty founder Bill Shipsey who proposed that further Havel's Places would be installed in cities around the world. It was decided to start with Dublin Shipsey's home town. The Dublin "Havel's Place" was installed in [[St. Patrick's Park]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland on [[Human Rights Day]], 2013 (10 December) by the Lord Mayor of Dublin [[Oisin Quinn]] and [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] Havel's former Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mzv.cz/dublin/en/news_and_activities/havel_s_place_in_dublin_10_12.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin project was conceived and promoted by [[Bill Shipsey]] with support from the City of Dublin and the Czech Ambassador to Ireland Tomas Kafka.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio.cz/en/section/one-on-one/havel-was-a-hero-who-didnt-disappoint-says-art-for-amnestys-bill-shipsey&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Havel's Place, "Espai Havel", ("Havel's Place" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) was dedicated in [[Barcelona]] by the Mayor of Barcelona, [[Xavier Trias]], and Karel Schwarzenberg on 15 February 2014 in the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] beside the [[Catalan Parliament]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.btv.cat/btvnoticies/2014/02/15/vaclav-havel-ciutadella-cadires-dialeg-parlament/|date=15 February 2014|accessdate=29 March 2017|title=El Parc de la Ciutadella acull un espai d’homenatge a Václav Havel|language=Catalan|website=beteve.cat}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Havel's Place was also conceived and promoted by Bill Shipsey.

On May 1, 2014 the fourth Havel's Place was dedicated in Maltese Square in Havel's home town of [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Václav Havel gets his 'Place' in Prague |work=The Prague Post |url=http://www.praguepost.com/prague-news/38778-vaclav-havel-gets-his-place-in-prague |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514131835/http://www.praguepost.com/prague-news/38778-vaclav-havel-gets-his-place-in-prague |archivedate=2014-05-14 |df= }}{{deadlink|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2014 the fifth Havel's Place was unveiled in the [[University of South Bohemia]] in [[České Budějovice]], as part of an international project of public places dedicated to the late Czech president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 March 2017|url=http://www.vaclavhavel-library.org/en/index/calendar/603/ceremonial-unveiling-of-havel-s-place-in-ceske-budejovice|title=Ceremonial unveiling Havel's Place in České Budějovice|website=Vaclav Havel Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2014 the sixth 'Havel's Place' was unveiled on the Campus of [[Venice International University]], San Servolo Island. [[Venice]] in the presence of Ambassador Umberto Vattani, President of Venice International University; Petr Burianek, Czech Ambassador to Italy; Honorary Consul of the Czech Republic, Giorgio Boatto; and Professor Agar Brugiavini, the Dean of Venice International University. Michaela Jorgensen-Day and [[Bill Shipsey]] raised the money for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogaveneta.it/novita-del-sito/330-havel-s-place.html |title=Havel's Place: resoconto fotografico |first=Nereo |last=Zane |date=30 September 2014 |language=Italian |website=vogaveneta.it |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006153945/http://www.vogaveneta.it/novita-del-sito/330-havel-s-place.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2014, the 7th Havel's Place was unveiled in front of the café at the Municipal Library in [[Hradec Králové]], Czech Republic. The creation of a Havel's Place in Hradec Králové was initiated by deputy mayor Josef Krofta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaclavhavel-library.org/en/havelsplace/hradec|title=Hradec Králové|website=Vaclav Havel Library|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, two Havel's Places were unveiled to honour the 25th anniversary of the [[Velvet Revolution]]. The 8th Havel's Place was promoted by then Czech Ambassador to the U.K. Michael Zantovsky and unveiled on November 6 at [[Oxford University]] on the banks of the [[River Cherwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sametový den na Oxfordu: Havel dostal lavičku, Halík posluchárnu|language=Czech|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/291535-sametovy-den-na-oxfordu-havel-dostal-lavicku-halik-poslucharnu/|accessdate=29 March 2017|website=ceskatelevize.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th, promoted by Bill Shipsey and Iveta Stanislavova, was dedicated at [[The Hague]], November 8, at [[Lange Voorhout]], by: Jozias van Aarsten, Mayor of The Hague; H.E. Jaroslav Horák, Ambassador of the Czech Republic to the Netherlands; Eduard Nazarski, Netherlands Amnesty International Director; and Bořek Šípek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denhaagfm.nl/2014/11/08/kunstwerk-vaclav-havels-place-onthuld-fotoserie/|title=Kunstwerk Vaclav Havel’s Place onthuld (fotoserie)|date=8 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22nd 2017 a Havel's Place was unveiled in Lisbon in a collaboration between the Czech Ambassador to Portugal, Cultural Counsellor to the Camara de Lisboa Catarina Vaz Pinto and Bill Shipsey. Karel Schwarzenberg attended the dedication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vaclavhavel-library.org/en/havelsplace/lisabon&lt;/ref&gt;

The 25th Havel's Place was unveiled in [[Ljubljana]] on the 16th March 2018 by Nataša Posel, Director of Amnesty International Slovenia and Mateja Demšič Head of the Department of Culture of the City of Ljubljana. This was also promoted by Bill Shipsey and was the first Havel's Place in a city of a former communist country outside the Czech Republic.

'''''The Holy Trinity, with the Virgin and Saint John and donors''''' ({{lang-it|Santa Trinità }}) is a [[fresco]] by the Early [[Italian Renaissance]] painter [[Masaccio]]. It is located in the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], in [[Florence]].

==History==

The ''Trinity'' is thought to have been created by Masaccio sometime between 1425-1427.  He died in late 1428 at the age of 26, or having just turned 27, leaving behind a relatively small body of work.  This painting was one of his last major commissions, and is considered to be one of his masterpieces. 
===Location===
The fresco is located along the middle of the basilica's left aisle.  Although the configuration of this space has changed since the artwork was created, there are clear indications that the fresco was aligned ''very'' precisely in relationship with the sight-lines and perspective arrangement of the room at the time; particularly a former entrance-way facing the painting; in order to enhance the [[tromp l'oeil]] effect. There was also an altar, mounted as a shelf-ledge between the upper and lower sections of the fresco, further emphasizing the "reality" of the artifice.

===Commissioners and donors===
Not much is known about the details of the commission; no contemporaneous documents naming the altar-piece's patron(s) have been found.  The two [[donor portraits]] included in the fresco, one figure kneeling on either side of the archway, have not been positively identified.  The persons depicted are almost certainly contemporary Florentines; either the persons who funded the work, or relatives or close associates.  According to the established conventions of such depictions, it is generally, but not universally, assumed that they were probably still alive at the time of the artwork's commissioning.  Presumably, the representations in the painting serve as relatively accurate likenesses of their actual appearance at the time when their portraits were created.

The leading theories as to their identity favour two local families; either the Lenzi or, for at least one of the figures, a member of the Berti, who were a working-class family from the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence.  According to recently discovered (as of 2012) records of the Berti family, they owned a tomb at the foot of the fresco,&lt;ref name="Rita Maria Comanducci 2003"&gt;Rita Maria Comanducci, "'L'altare Nostro de la Trinità': Masaccio's Trinity and the Berti Family," ''The Burlington Magazine,'' 145 (2003) 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that they might have had a particular "devotional loyalty" to veneration of the Holy Trinity.  Other sources mention a Lenzi tomb near the altar, with the inscription "Domenico di Lenzo, et Suorum 1426", as well as other Lenzi decorations in the chapel at that time, and assume the donor portraits to be posthumous images of Domenico (and his spouse?); based on the full-profile pose used for the figures.  In the Florentine dating system of that time, the new year began on March 25; and factoring in the conversion from Julian to Gregorian calendars Domenico's death, as recorded, would have been on 19 January 1427.

It has been hypothesized that [[Fra' Alessio Strozzi]] and/or [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] may have been involved, or at least consulted, in the creation of ''Trinity''.  Brunelleschi's work on linear perspective and architecture certainly inspired the painting, and this is clearly demonstrated within Massacio's work.  Fra' Alessio's involvement has been posited more on the matter of the appropriate depiction of the Holy Trinity, according to the preferences and sensibilities of the [[Dominican order]].  However, there is, to date, no concrete evidence for the direct involvement of either of these 2 persons, and due to the lack of documentation about the exact circumstances of the piece's creation, theories about 3rd party involvement in the creative process remain speculative.

===Giorgio Vasari and Cosimo I===

Around 1568 [[Cosimo I]], then Duke of Florence, commissioned [[Giorgio Vasari]] to undertake extensive renovation work at Santa Maria Novella; in keeping with the tastes and religious politics of the time.  This work included reconfiguring and redecoration of the chapel-area in which Masaccio's fresco was located.

Vasari had already written about Masaccio, including a highly favourable mention of this specific work, in his [[Vite]].  When it came time to implement the planned renovations of the chapel containing ''Trinity'', circa 1570, Vasari chose to leave the fresco intact and construct a new altar and screen ''in front'' of Masaccio's painting; leaving a small gap, and effectively concealing and protecting the earlier work.  While it seems reasonably clear that it was Vasari's deliberate intention to preserve Masaccio's painting, it is unclear to what extent Duke Cosimo and/or other "concerned parties" were involved in this decision.  To decorate the new altar, Vasari painted a Madonna of the Rosary; the image is still extant, but has been moved to a different location within the church.

===Rediscovery and subsequent history===

Masaccio's ''Holy Trinity'' was rediscovered when Vasari's altar was dismantled during renovations in 1860.  The [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the upper part of the fresco, was subsequently transferred to canvas, and relocated to a different part of the church.  It is unclear from available sources whether the lower section of the fresco, the [[cadaver tomb]], remained unknown or was deliberately omitted (and possibly plastered over) during the 1860s construction work.

Restoration was done to the Crucifixion section of the painting at that time, to replace missing areas of the design; mostly architectural details around the perimeter of the work.  While the painting was in damaged condition when rediscovered, it is also likely that further damage was caused by the transfer from plaster to canvas.

In the 20th century, the cadaver tomb portion of the work was rediscovered still ''in situ'', and the two halves were re-united in their original location in 1952.  Leonetto Tintori undertook restoration work on the combined whole during 1950-1954.

==Description==

[[File:Masaccio. Trinity. Scheme of linear perspective..jpg|thumb|left|(note that this line-drawing does not include adequate spacing for the altar-ledge between upper and lower sections)]]

===Dimensions===
The painting is approximately 317&amp;nbsp;cm (125&amp;nbsp;in) wide, and 667&amp;nbsp;cm (263&amp;nbsp;in) high.  This gives an overall vertical-to-horizontal proportion of about 2:1.  The ratio between the upper and lower sections of the work is very roughly 3:1.

===Altar===
Originally, the design included an actual ledge, used as an altar, physically projecting outward from the now-blank band between the upper and lower sections of the fresco; further enhancing the sense of depth and reality in the work.  Constructed as a pillared-shelf ~5&amp;nbsp;ft. above the floor, and estimated to be about 60&amp;nbsp;cm. wide, the altar-table's appearance would have been intended to match and/or complement the painted architecture.  Its facing-edge and upper surface integrating with the fresco's steps and archway; and its supporting pillars, both real and illusory, combining with the shadows caused by the over-hang to create a crypt-like effect for the tomb beneath.  The upper section of the fresco still retains traces of candle-smoke and heat-effects from use of this altar.

===Figures===
The painted figures are roughly life-sized.  For an adult of average height facing the painting, their eye-line would have been slightly above 'ground-level' in the work; with Death in the form of the crypt and skeleton directly front of them, and the promise of Salvation above.

===Damaging and restoring===
Over the course of time and events (see above), the fresco has been damaged and subsequently restored.  Much of the outer edge of the upper section, mainly architectural detail, is replacement work.  Some regions of "new" paint can be clearly identified by differences in colour, visual texture and detail; and in certain places, by apparent "cracks" along the boundary between the original fresco surface, and areas of the design where the original surface is entirely absent and was repainted.

===Lower section===
The lower section, depicting a [[memento mori]], in the form of a [[cadaver tomb]], has also lost significant paint; but the restoration work there has been more restrained and less extensive.  This is probably due, at least in part, to the fact that the lower half of the fresco was not recovered until the mid-20th century.  By this time, "standard practice" in restoration had become more conservative, with a stronger emphasis on preserving and revealing the authentic work of the original artist; whereas earlier restorations tended to have more focus on producing an aesthetically pleasing "recreation" of the artwork.

As far as can be determined from available records, at the time when this painting was created no large-scale Roman-style [[coffered]] [[barrel vault]], Triumphal arch or otherwise, had been constructed in Western [[Christendom]] since [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Giedion, in ''Space, Time and Architecture'', points out that the first would be [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s interior and external barrel vaults at Sant'Andrea, Mantua, begun nearly five decades after Masaccio's premature death.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable characteristics===
The ''Trinity'' is noteworthy for its inspiration taken from ancient Roman [[triumphal arch]]es and the strict adherence to recently developed perspective techniques, with a [[vanishing point]] at the viewer's eye level, so that, as Vasari describes it&lt;ref&gt;''Le [[vite]]...'':"Masaccio"&lt;/ref&gt;"a barrel vault drawn in perspective, and divided into squares with rosettes that diminish and are foreshortened so well that there seems to be a hole in the wall." This artistic technique is called ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'', which means "deceives the eye," in French. The fresco had a transforming effect on generations of Florentine painters and visiting artists.  The sole figure without a fully realized three-dimensional occupation of space is the majestic God supporting the Cross, considered an immeasurable being. The kneeling patrons represent another important novelty, occupying the viewer's own space, "in front of" the picture plane, which is represented by the Ionic columns and the Corinthian pilasters from which the feigned vault appears to spring; they are depicted in the traditional prayerful pose of [[donor portrait]]s, but on the same scale as the central figures, rather than the more usual 'diminution', and with noteworthy attention to realism and volume.

Several diverse interpretations of the fresco have been proposed.  Most scholars have seen it as a traditional kind of image, intended for personal devotions and commemorations of the dead, although explanations of how the painting reflects these functions differ in their details.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Schlegel, "Observations on Masaccio's Trinity Fresco in Santa Maria Novella," ''Art Bulletin,'' 45 (1963) 19-34; Otto von Simson, "Uber die Bedeutung von Masaccios Trinitätfresko in Santa Maria Novella," ''Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen,'' 8 (1966) 119-159; Rona Goffen, "Masaccio's ''Trinity'' and the Letter to the Hebrews," ''Memorie domenicane,'' n.s/ 11 (1980) 489-504; Alessandro Cortesi, "Una lettura teologica," in ''La Trinità di Masaccio:  il restauro dell'anno duemila,'' ed. Cristina Danti, Florence, 2002, 49-56; Timothy Verdon, "Masaccio's ''Trinity,''" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 158-176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The iconography of the [[Trinity]], flanked by Mary and John or including donors, is not uncommon in Italian art of the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and the association of the Trinity with a tomb also has precedents.  No precedent for the exact iconography of Masaccio's fresco, combining all these elements, has been discovered, however.

The figures of the two patrons have most often been identified as members of the Lenzi family or, more recently, a member of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence.&lt;ref name="Rita Maria Comanducci 2003"/&gt;  They serve as models of religious devotion for viewers but, because they are located closer to the sacred figures than the viewers are, they also lay claim to special status.

The [[cadaver tomb]] consists of a sarcophagus on which lies a skeleton.  "Carved" in the wall above the skeleton is an inscription:  "IO FU[I] G[I]A QUEL CHE VOI S[I]ETE E QUEL CH['] I[O] SONO VO[I] A[N]CO[R] SARETE" (I once was what you are and what I am you also will be).  This ''[[memento mori]]'' underlines that the painting was intended to serve as a lesson to the viewers. At the simplest level the imagery must have suggested to the 15th-century faithful that, since they all would die, only their faith in the Trinity and Christ's sacrifice would allow them to overcome their transitory existences.

According to American art historian Mary McCarthy:

{{quote|text=The fresco, with its terrible logic, is like a proof in philosophy or mathematics, God the Father, with His unrelenting eyes, being the axiom from which everything else irrevocably flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Mary|date=August 22, 1959|title=A City of Stone|journal=The New Yorker|location=New York|pages=48|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1959/08/22/1959_08_22_038_TNY_CARDS_000258040|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Rylov Blue Expanse.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''In High Azure'']]
'''''In High Azure''''' («В голубом просторе») is a masterpiece  by Russian artist [[Arkady Rylov]] (1870–1939), painted in 1918. It is exhibited in the [[Tretiakov Gallery]],  Moscow.

==History==
Painted in 1918 in [[Petrograd]].

== Description ==

At the background of high azure sky and snow-white clouds we can see swans flying over the dark blue sea. Massive cold snow-covered rocks are seen on the horizon. There is a ship under full sail adding to romantic character of the dark stormy sea. The swans' flight is free and easy as if they swim in light transparent air. The outline of the clouds over the horizon emphasizes the birds' flight direction. Though they move from right to left you do not feel that the motion continues beyond the bounds of the picture. Swans seem to move towards the sailing ship and go back ( over snow-covered rocks) to the right corner of the canvas.

'''John Hampson''' was an artist whose works hang at the [[Fairbanks Museum]] in [[Vermont]]. Hampson is known for his unusual [[mosaic]]s formed of tens of thousands of insects, whether [[moths]], [[butterflies]], or [[beetles]].

==Life==
Hampson was born in [[Stockport, Cheshire]], [[England]] on July 9, 1836.&lt;ref name="Fairbanks Museum"/&gt; He trained as a machinist&lt;ref name="Williams Town Art"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samels |first1=Zoe |title=Pinning Down History {{!}} Insects, America, and the Art of John Hampson |url=http://www.williamstownart.org/fellows/pinning%20down%20history.pdf |publisher=Williamstown Art|journal=Art Conservator |date=2012 |pages=12–15 |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came to the United States in 1860. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he worked in the government navy yards, after which he subsequently moved to thirteen different states. In 1877, he settled with his wife in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Williams Town Art" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbanks Museum"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bug Art |url=https://www.fairbanksmuseum.org/explore/bug-art |publisher=[[Fairbanks Museum]] |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked briefly for [[Thomas Edison]] in his Menlo Park laboratory.&lt;ref name="CitroFoulds2004"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Citro, Joseph A.

When Hampson died, his daughter searched for a museum that would exhibit his art, finding the Fairbanks Museum, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont,&lt;ref name="Goska"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/200090220/?terms=John+Hampson+art |title=An Artful Display of Bugs in St. Johnsbury |last=Goska |first=Dave |date=August 13, 1978 |work=The Burlington Free Press |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the  Seven of the works are on display at the museum; three collages, ''General Slocum'' (of [[Henry Warner Slocum]]), a portrait of George Washington, and a kaleidoscopic design are considered too damaged to exhibit.&lt;ref name="Williams Town Art" /&gt;

==Descriptions of Hampson's work==
The ''[[Newark News]]''&lt;ref name="National Endowment for the Humanities"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gillis |first1=Anna Marie |title=Best Bug Art Ever|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/januaryfebruary/curio/best-bug-art-ever |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated "It would take perhaps three or four years for Hampson to complete one picture, mounting the insects so that the white, black, red, orange, blue and yellow wings would form pictures of famous American generals in characteristic poses, or intricate designs such as the North Star, completed in 1887, or the Centennial Wheel, finished in 1892, copies from patchwork quilts, which had won prizes at exhibitions."&lt;ref name="Fairbanks Museum" /&gt;

The website ''[[Roadside America (website)|Roadside America]]'' described his work as "delicate interweaving of wings and metallic sheen of beetle carapace", and considered that Hampson had had "the misfortune of being born a hundred years too soon", speculating that had he lived now he might have been celebrated for building a "chapel on a 'Bug Mountain'".&lt;ref name="Roadside America" /&gt;

''[[Atlas Obscura]]'' considered the mosaics "the stars of Fairbanks' collections", finding them "absolutely jaw-dropping in person."&lt;ref name ="Enemark"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Enemark |first1=Michelle |title=Notes from the Field: From Tombstone Quarry to Natural History in Northern Vermont |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/notes-from-the-field-northern-vermont |publisher=[[Atlas Obscura]] |accessdate=30 March 2018 |date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Judith Beheading Holofernes''''' is a painting of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]] by [[Caravaggio]], painted in {{circa|1598–1599}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artble.com/artists/caravaggio/paintings/judith_beheading_holofernes|title=Judith Beheading Holofernes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.artble.com|publisher=Artble|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The widow Judith first charms the Syrian general [[Holofernes]], then decapitates him in his tent. The painting was rediscovered in 1950 and is part of the collection of the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]] in Rome.

== Subject ==

The [[deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Judith]] tells how Judith served her people by seducing and pleasuring [[Holofernes]], the [[Assyria|Syria]]n General. Judith gets Holofernes drunk, then seizes her sword and slays him: "Approaching to his bed, she took hold of the hair of his head" (Judith 13:7–8).

Caravaggio's approach was, typically, to choose the moment of greatest dramatic impact: the moment of decapitation itself. The figures are set out in a shallow stage, theatrically lit from the side, isolated against the inky black background. Judith's maid Abra stands beside her mistress to the right as Judith extends her arm to hold a blade  against Holofernes's neck; lying on his stomach, neck contorted as he turns his head towards his assassin, he is vulnerable. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio adjusted the placement of Holofernes' head as he proceeded, separating it slightly from the torso and moving it minutely to the right. The faces of the three characters demonstrate the artist's mastery of emotion, Judith's countenance in particular showing a mix of determination and repulsion. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] and others were deeply influenced by this work; while they even surpassed Caravaggio's physical realism, it has been argued that none matched his capture of Judith's psychological ambivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'' (Phaidon, 1998) pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for Judith is probably the Roman courtesan Fillide Melandroni, who posed for several other works by Caravaggio around this year; the scene itself, especially the details of blood and decapitation, were presumably drawn from his observations of the public execution of [[Beatrice Cenci]] a few years before.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Robb, ''M: The Caravaggio Enigma'' (Duffy and Snellgrove, 1998), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

A painting believed by some to be Caravaggio's second version of ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'' was discovered in Toulouse in 2014. An export ban was placed on the painting by the French government while tests were carried out to establish its authenticity.&lt;ref name=BBCApr16&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36024865|title=Painting thought to be Caravaggio masterpiece found in French loft|date=12 April 2016|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="judith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGivern|first1=Hannah|title='Caravaggio' found in French attic unveiled in Milan|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/caravaggio-found-in-french-attic-unveiled-in-milan/|accessdate=26 January 2017|publisher=Art Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean fabric arts''' are craft of making fabric and textiles produced by the people on the Korean Peninsula. They have a long history, which includes fabrics such as [[guksa]], [[nobang]], [[sha (fabric)|sha]], [[jangmidan]], Korean-made [[jacquard]], brocade and satin. Or crafts such as the Korean quilts known as [[bojagi]], [[Korean embroidery]], [[Korean knots]], [[Korean clothing]] and the rarer arts of [[Korean blinds weaving]] and [[Korean paper clothing]]. In old time, people usually wore natural dyeing clothes.

[[File:11. Labbacallee Wedge Tomb, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|right| Labbacallee]]
'''Labbacallee wedge tomb''' ({{lang-ga|Leaba Chaillí}} "[[Hag]]'s Bed") is a large pre-historic burial monument, located {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Fermoy]] and {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Glanworth]], [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is the largest Irish [[wedge tomb]] and dates from roughly 2300 BC.&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland. A Field Guide | publisher=Blackstaff Press | location=Belfast | pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Features==
The site has three large capstones which slope downwards towards the back, the largest being {{convert|7.8|m|abbr=on}} long and weighing {{convert|10|t|sigfig=2}}. The gallery below is made up of a large rectangular chamber, with a small one behind it, divided by a slab. The gallery is triple-walled, buttressed at the back by three slabs set parallel to the axis of the tomb. To the front of the gallery are the remains of a large rectangular unroofed antechamber which is wider than the gallery and separated from it by a large slab.&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt; Outside this there was a further row of stones running off at an angle, but few of the original stones remain.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Excavations==
In 1934 excavations revealed a number of inhumations, fragments of a late [[Stone Age]] decorated pot, and fragments of bone and stone.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Local folklore associates the site with the Celtic Hag-Goddess [[Cailleach Bheur]], and during the excavations the site was found to contain the remains of a woman. Although the body had been positioned within one chamber of the tomb, her skull was found in another chamber.

The '''Lanham (Trademark) Act''' ({{USStatute|79|489|60|427|1946|7|5}}, codified at {{USC|15|1051}} et seq. ({{usctc|15|22}})) is the primary federal [[trademark]] statute of law in the United States. The Act prohibits a number of activities, including [[trademark infringement]], [[trademark dilution]], and [[false advertising]].

==History==
Named for Representative [[Fritz G. Lanham]] of Texas, the Act was passed on July 5, 1946, and signed into law by President [[Harry Truman]], taking effect "one year from its enactment", on July 6, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham Act, § 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In rare circumstances, a conflict will arise between trademarks that have been in use since before the Lanham Act went into effect, thus requiring the courts to examine the dispute according to the trademark act that existed before the Lanham Act.

The Act has been amended several times since its enactment. Its impact was significantly enhanced by the [[Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|98|473|98|2179|1984|10|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made the intentional use of a counterfeit [[trademark]] or the unauthorized use of a counterfeit trademark an offense under [[Title 18 of the United States Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|2320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced enforcement remedies through the use of ''[[ex parte]]'' seizures&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1116|d}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the award of treble profits or damages (whichever is greater).&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1117|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] inserted {{uscsub|15|1125|d}}, and amended {{uscsub|15|1114|2|D}}.

===Civil enforcement===
§§ 42 and 43 of the Act (now known as {{usc|15|1124|1125}}) set out the remedies that can be sought when a trademark is infringed. These provisions forbid the importation of goods that infringe registered trademarks, and restrict, through the use of injunctions and damages, the use of false descriptions and trademark dilution.

§ 43(a) ({{uscsub|15|1125|a}}) is the "likelihood of confusion" standard for infringement of an unregistered trademark or trade dress, and courts still frequently refer to the provision as "Section 43(a)":

{{bq|1=
15 U.S.C. § 1125 - False designations of origin, false descriptions, and dilution forbidden

(a) Civil action

(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which{{emdash}}
:(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or
:(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
}}

{{uscsub|15|1125|a|1|A}} is often used when false or misleading statements are alleged to have hurt a consumer or business.  The claimant must prove that a false or misleading statement was made in commerce and that the statement creates a likelihood of harm to the plaintiff.

{{uscsub|15|1125|a|1|B}} is often used when false or misleading statements are alleged to have hurt a business.

===Jurisprudence===

The Act has been held to have extraterritorial impact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1999|last=Brown|first=Erika M.|title=The Extraterritorial Reach of Trademark Law: A Review of Recent Decisions Under the Lanham Act|url=http://iplj.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Essay-THE-EXTRATERRITORIAL-REACH-OF-UNITED-STATES-TRADEMARK-LAW-A-REVIEW-OF-RECENT-DECISIONS-UNDER-THE-LANHAM-ACT.pdf|journal=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]]|volume = IX|issue = 3|pages = 863{{endash}}884|publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the circuit courts have been giving more favorable interpretations in extending its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lawrence R.

T. Eaton Co.|vol= 234|reporter= F. 2d|opinion= 633|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 1956|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/1956867234F2d633_1722|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contemplates a three-part test in determining whether the Act applies (where at least two factors must be met):

#the conduct of the defendant must have a substantial effect on United States commerce,
#the defendant must be a United States citizen, and
#there must be an absence of conflict with foreign law.

Although the Lanham Act sets out clear parameters as to what constitutes trademark infringement, subsequent court decisions, especially those involving the Internet, have loosened the strictures.&lt;ref name=cardozolawreview&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2005|last=Rothman|first=Jennifer E.|title=Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads of Trademark Law|url=http://cardozolawreview.com/Joomla1.5/content/27-1/ROTHMAN.FINAL.VERSION.pdf|journal=[[Cardozo Law Review]]|volume = 27|issue = 1|pages = 105{{endash}}191|publisher = [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law had no impact on public domain works in ''[[Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.]]''

In 2014, the various interpretations that had been adopted by the circuit courts as to who had [[Standing (law)|standing]] to sue under {{uscsub|15|1125|a}} were ousted by the Court in ''[[Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components]]'', where [[Justice Scalia]] adopted a multi-step approach:

#Under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]], the plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized "injury in fact" that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]]'', {{ussc|504|555|1992}}, at 560&lt;/ref&gt;
#''AGC'' requires the ascertainment, as a matter of statutory interpretation, of the "scope of the private remedy created by" Congress, and the "class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under" a legislatively conferred cause of action.&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters'', {{ussc|459|519|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests "fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allen v. Wright]]'', {{ussc|468|737|1984}}, at 751&lt;/ref&gt; and the "zone of interests" formulation applies to all statutorily created causes of action, as it is a "requirement of general application" and Congress is presumed to "legislat[e] against the background of" it, "which applies unless it is expressly negated."&lt;ref&gt;''Bennett v. Spear'', {{ussc|520|154|1997}}, 162-163&lt;/ref&gt;
#A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation'', {{ussc|503|258|1992}}, at 268{{endash}}270&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff suing under §1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant's advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.
#Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under §1125(a).

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.]]'', {{ussc |3=2013 |docket=12-761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Act complemented the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], allowing a company to sue for infringement by way of [[civil action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = POM notches legal win in Coke's fruit juice battle|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/101754215|publisher = [[Reuters]]|date = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Matal v. Tam]]'' in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in {{uscsub|15|1052|a}} of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as disparaging an individual or group, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants' [[freedom of speech (United States)|freedom of speech]].

==Divisions==
In the [[United States Code]], the Act has been divided into four subchapters:

{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! Subchapter !! Name !! Sections  !!Description
|- valign="top"
| I || The [[Principal Register]] || §§ 1051–1072 || Lanham Act, ss. 1–22
|- valign="top"
| II || The [[Supplemental Register]] || §§ 1091–1096 || Lanham Act, ss. 23–28
|- valign="top"
| rowspan = "3" | III ||rowspan = "3" | General Provisions || §§ 1111–1127 || Lanham Act, ss. 29–45
|- valign="top"
| § 1128 || later creation of the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council
|- valign="top"
| § 1129 || passage of prohibitions against [[International Cybercrime#Copyright.C2.AD and Trademark.C2.AD-related Offences|cyberpiracy]] originally codified here, but now covered by {{UnitedStatesCode|15|8131}}
|- valign="top"
| IV || The [[Madrid Protocol]] || §§ 1141–1141n || later passage, in consequence of US accession to the [[Madrid system]]
|}

===The Trademark Registers===
Subchapter I sets forth the requirements that a mark must meet to receive a registration on the [[Principal Register]], which bestows various rights on the trademark owner to prevent others from infringing their mark. Among the requirements are prohibitions against the registration of marks that are confusingly similar to existing marks, are generic or merely descriptive, are scandalous or immoral, or fall onto certain other prohibited categories. Subchapter I also sets forth certain procedural requirements, such as the submission of an affidavit of continued use after five years of registration.

Subchapter II sets forth a form of registration on the [[Supplemental Register]], for certain marks that are unregistrable under Subchapter I, but may become registrable in the future, such as those that are merely descriptive. This form of registration, while not granting all the protections of registration on the Principal Register, does provide notice to potential infringers that the mark is in use, and also provides some procedural benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43081">The '''Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts''' are Canadian awards given each year to recognize outstanding contribution to the fields of visual and media arts. The awards were created in 2000 by then [[Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]]. The awards are funded and administered by the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].

An independent peer jury of senior visual and media arts professionals selects up to seven laureates to be recognized for artistic achievement and one award for outstanding contributions in a professional or volunteer role. Visual and media artists in fine arts (painting, drawing, photography, print-making and sculpture, including installation and other three-dimensional work), applied arts (architecture and fine crafts), independent film and video, or audio and new media are eligible for the annual award. Since 2007, the Saidye Bronfman Award for excellence in the fine crafts is also awarded by this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Awards|url=http://ggavma.canadacouncil.ca/the_awards-les_prix|website=Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts|publisher=Canada Council for the Arts|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316093609/http://ggavma.canadacouncil.ca/the_awards-les_prix|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, each laureate received $25,000 and recognition in the form of an exhibition at the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=James|title=Eight Canadian visual and media artists win Governor-General Awards|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/career-excellence-awards-announced/article23579655/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5754">'''Max Loreau''' (7 June 1928, Brussels – 7 January 1990) was a 20th-century Belgian philosopher, poet and [[art critic]]

== Biography ==
Max Loreau is interested in the aesthetics of the [[Renaissance]] before publishing the complete catalog of works by [[Jean Dubuffet]]. He became close to the members of the [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]] movement. He devotes various articles to painters like [[Corneille Guillaume Beverloo|Guillaume Corneille]] or [[Asger Jorn]], before drafting a more comprehensive study of the [[logogram]]s by [[Christian Dotremont]] in 1975. He also worked with [[Pierre Alechinsky]] who helped him to publish one of his last texts, ''L'Épreuve''.

His philosophy takes root in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], from which he tries to rehabilitate the body. He starts from a genetic approach in which he tries to rethink the origin of the phenomenon as the genesis of the apparition. In ''Cri'' (Shout), he inaugurates a radical style from which he describes the effect of rupture, tearing and the void that emerges from the shout. This uncovering of the experience of language invites us to redefine the emergence of the apparition and show how the view resumes its bearings and reconstitutes a world. Starting from a critique of the Platonic vision, which fundamentally denies the body, since it is idealized as a vision of ideas, this path leads Loreau to rethink a new beginning of the body, vision and language.

Max Loreau also published various poems under the titles ''Cerceaux s'orcellent'', ''Chants de la perpétuelle venue'' and  ''Florence portée aux nues''.

The '''Missouri Centennial half dollar''' is a [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative]] [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] in 1921. It was designed by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]]. The [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]] wanted a [[commemorative coin]] to mark its centennial that year. Legislation for such a coin passed through Congress without opposition, and was signed on March 4, 1921 by President [[Warren G. Harding]] on his [[Inauguration of Warren G. Harding|inauguration day]]. The federal [[Commission of Fine Arts]] hired Aitken to design the coin, which depicted [[Daniel Boone]] on both sides.  The reverse design, showing Boone with a Native American, was likely intended to symbolize the displacement of the Indians by white settlers.

To increase sales, a portion of the issue was produced with the mark 2★4, symbolic of Missouri being the 24th state. Although admired for the design, the coins did not sell as well as hoped, and almost 60 percent were returned to the [[Philadelphia Mint]] for melting. There are fewer coins with 2★4 than without, but they remain near-equal in value.

== Legislation ==
The State of Missouri, admitted to [[United States of America|the Union]] in 1821 as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]], wanted a commemorative coin for sale at the Missouri Centennial Exposition and State Fair, to be held in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] from August 8 to 20, 1921.{{sfn|Bowers|p=153}} Legislation for such a half dollar was introduced in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by that state's [[Selden P. Spencer]] on January 20, 1921, the bill being designated S. 4893.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL66-381&amp;type=LEG_HIST|title=Missouri 100th Anniversary 50-Cent Piece|publisher=ProQuest Congressional|accessdate=March 6, 2017|subscription=yes|number=S. 4893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "bill" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://li.proquest.com/legislativeinsight/LegHistMain.jsp?searchtype=DOCPAGE&amp;parentAccNo=66-381&amp;docAccNo=66-381&amp;docType=LEG_HIST&amp;id=1488820350007#|publisher=United States Senate|title=Missouri 100th Anniversary 50-Cent Piece}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency.&lt;ref name = "bill" /&gt; The bill was reported to the full Senate by Connecticut's [[George P. McLean]] on January 25 with an amendment reducing the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 250,000 and a recommendation that it pass. Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall]], who was presiding over the Senate, asked if there was objection to its passage.  The Minority Leader, Democrat [[Oscar Underwood]] of Alabama, said he did not think there would be objection, but that the bill should be read first.  Idaho Senator [[William E. Borah]] stated he would object if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had [[morning business]] in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1921|9995|date=January 25, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An identical bill, H. R. 15767,&lt;ref name = "224 report" /&gt; had been introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on January 17, 1921.&lt;ref name = "profile" /&gt; On February 10, Indiana Representative [[Albert Vestal]], chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures (to which the bill had been referred) reported it back to the House with an amendment identical to that approved by the Senate, and with a recommendation that the bill pass.&lt;ref name="210 report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=7777%20H.rp.1315&amp;type=REPORT|title=Coinage of 50-Cent Piece in Commemoration of Admission of Missouri into the Union|date=February 10, 1921|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. 4983 had been referred to that committee after its receipt by the House, and on February 24 the Coinage Committee recommended the Senate bill pass the House, noting that the two bills were identical.&lt;ref name = "224 report" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=7777%20H.rp.1356&amp;type=REPORT
|title=Coinage of 50-Cent Piece in Commemoration of Admission of Missouri into the Union|subscription=yes|date=February 24, 1921|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 4893 was considered by the House of Representatives on March 2, 1921, with two days remaining in the congressional session. Ohio's [[Warren Gard]] had asked  questions about previous coin bills when they passed through the House.&lt;ref name = "cr1"&gt;{{USCongRec|1920|5947–5950|date=April 21, 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gard enquired of Vestal whether the Missouri bill was identical to the earlier bills, and whether it contained the same safeguards, and Vestal confirmed these. The bill was passed by the House without recorded objection,&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1921|4357|date=March 2, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was enacted into law with the signature of the new president, [[Warren G. Harding]], on [[Inauguration of Warren G. Harding|his inauguration day]], March 4, 1921.&lt;ref name = "profile" /&gt;{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=164}}

== Preparation ==
While the legislation was still pending in Congress, on January 29, 1921, Senator Spencer wrote to [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts)|Charles Moore]], chairman of the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], regarding the bill.  Moore replied on February 2, advising that one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin be hired, and that the resulting work be subjected to the friendly criticism of other artists.  Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a "[[Covered wagon|prairie-schooner]]&amp;nbsp;... second, the heads of [pioneer Daniel] [[Daniel Boone|Boone]] and [early Missouri politician Thomas Hart] [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Benton]]; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward".{{sfn|Taxay|pp=52–53}} The hired sculptor could choose among these concepts, Moore suggested, and decide which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a "standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures '24' in center of star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory."{{sfn|Taxay|pp=53, 56}}&lt;!-- 54 and 55 are pictures --&gt; 

Montgomery also proposed that a star with the number "24" (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck.  These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, an expense estimated at $1,750.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}} Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words "&lt;small&gt;MISSOURI CENTENNIAL, SEDALIA, 1921&lt;/small&gt;" appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}} 

The Fine Arts Commission hired [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]], a sculptor best known in numismatic circles for his design for the $50 [[Panama-Pacific commemorative coins|Panama Pacific gold pieces]].{{sfn|Bowers|p=153}} This was apparently not communicated to the Missouri commission as on May 17, [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], a member of the Fine Arts Commission, told Moore that he had heard that someone associated with the Missouri Centennial had made inquiries with the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, aimed at hiring a sculptor.{{sfn|Taxay|p=56}}  Whether Moore wrote to Montgomery is unclear, but he wrote to Spencer on May 26, advising the senator that the designs had been preliminarily approved.  Commission members had suggested several changes; these were implemented and, on June 9, the Fine Arts Commission approved the design, a decision communicated by letter that day to the [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]], [[Raymond T. Baker]].{{sfn|Taxay|pp=56–58}} To speed production, the Medallic Art Company produced [[Glossary of numismatics#H|hubs]] from which working dies to produce the coins could be made.{{sfn|Bowers|p=154}} These hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 29, 1921.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}}

== Design ==
[[File:Unfinished portrait of Daniel Boone by Chester Harding 1820.jpg|thumb|upright|The obverse depicts [[Daniel Boone]], shown here in an unfinished portrait by Chester Harding]]

The bust of frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], who lived in Missouri for the final quarter century of his life, appears on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=123}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, note speculation that the obverse may have been inspired by [[Albin Polasek]]'s sculptured bust of Boone in the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin jacket and a [[coonskin cap]]. The centennial dates, the name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the bust. The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American—Swiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a shield and [[peace pipe]], apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri; Breen stated "as though this was something to brag about".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=163–164}} The 1921 ''Report of the Director of the Mint'' describes the interaction as "Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man".{{sfn|Flynn|p=123}} The Missouri Centennial half dollar, which shows Boone on either side, is one of the few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides; other such depictions include Boone himself on the 1934–1938 [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] on the 1900-dated [[Lafayette dollar]] and the frontiersman on the 1936 [[Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar]].{{sfn|Bowers|p=156}}

The 24 stars on the reverse convey the same message that the 2★4 on the obverse of some specimens does—that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name &lt;small&gt;[[Sedalia, Missouri|SEDALIA]]&lt;/small&gt;, the site of the centennial exposition, appears in [[exergue]]. Aitken's stylized monogram, &lt;small&gt;RA&lt;/small&gt;, is near the rifle butt.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=164}} The Missouri piece, and the [[Columbian half dollar]] of 1892–1893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is &lt;small&gt;LIBERTY&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;IN GOD WE TRUST&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;E PLURIBUS UNUM&lt;/small&gt;.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=46}} The design was liked at the time of issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Missouri Centennial Half Dollar a Popular Coin|pages=484–485|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|date=October 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken "became the first American medalist to apply the principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand "like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} Mermeule noted that "the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello" and that "the coin as a whole is a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=162}} The author concluded of Aitken's works, "his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present worked very well in the United States commemorative coinage".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=163}}

== Production, distribution, and collecting ==
[[File:Original Aitken Design for Missouri Centennial half dollar.jpeg|thumb|left|Portion of advertisement for the half dollar (1921), showing a reverse design not used by Aitken]]

A total of 50,028 Missouri Centennial half dollars was struck at the Philadelphia Mint in July 1921, 28 being reserved for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=124}} The first coins displayed the 2★4 on the obverse; afterwards, this was ground off the dies and the remainder were struck without it.  The Sedalia Trust Company distributed the coins at a price of $1 on behalf of the centennial commission, selling both varieties by mail and the plain ones at the exposition in August.  There had been little advance publicity, and the exposition took place during the [[Recession of 1921]]. All of the 2★4 coins sold, but when sales slowed of the plain variety, 29,600 were returned to the mint for melting.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=164}}{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}} Early advertisements for the coin contained sketches prepared by Aitken, showing the obverse as issued, but depicting a reverse bearing the state [[Seal of Missouri]], that Aitken had abandoned when he found it did not work well.&lt;ref name = "num1221" /&gt; Aitken, in a letter published in part in the December 1921 issue of ''[[The Numismatist]]'' (the journal of the [[American Numismatic Association]]) wrote that "The illustration that you published was made from one of several drawings which I submitted to the Federal Art Commission. The Missouri committee was informed that I would work along these lines, though I was given full latitude for any change I might advise. The seal of the State did not work out well, so I developed the reverse with the two standing figures, which met with the instant approval of the Commission in Washington."&lt;ref name = "num1221"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A 'Variety' of the Missouri Centennial Half Dollar|page=575|journal=[[The Numismatist]]|date=December 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Missouri ad May 1922 Numismatist.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|May 1922 advertisement for the 2★4 coins, with the design as issued]]

The number of coins bearing the 2★4 is uncertain. Swiatek and Breen wrote that 5,000 were struck and were sold, meaning that 15,400 of the plain ones were issued.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=164}} Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, adhered to these figures.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=130}} Coin dealer David Bullowa wrote in 1937 that 10,000 of the 2★4 were issued, with which numismatic writer [[Q. David Bowers]] concurred, noting that the two varieties are about equal in rarity.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=155–156}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, estimates that 9,400 of the 2★4 were issued, and 11,400 of the plain.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1058}} Both varieties sold at a premium above the issue price by 1925, and at the height of the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 2★4 sold for $25 and the plain for $28.  By 1940, the 2★4 sold for more than the plain, and at the height of the second boom in 1980, the 2★4 brought $2,600 to the plain's $2,400. Yeoman's book lists the 2★4 for between $625 and $7,250, and the plain for between $400 and $6,650, each depending on condition.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1059}} An exceptional specimen of the plain variety sold at auction in 2015 for $70,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1921-missouri-50c-ms-coinid-19330|title=1921 Missouri 50C MS|publisher=Numismatic Guaranty Corporation|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one specimen in proof condition is known, sold at auction in 1992.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Jed|title=COINS; Mix-Up and Mystery: The 1921 Missouri Proof|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/02/style/coins-mix-up-and-mystery-the-1921-missouri-proof.html|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:National-arts-club.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The club's headquarters at 15 [[Gramercy Park]] South, the former [[Samuel J. Tilden House]] (May 2007)]] 

The '''National Arts Club''' is a private club on [[Gramercy Park]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1898 by [[Charles DeKay]], an art and literary critic of the ''[[New York Times]]'' to "stimulate, foster, and promote public interest in the arts and to educate the American people in the fine arts".  Since 1906 the organization has occupied the [[Samuel J. Tilden House]], a landmarked [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic Revival]]&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/THE-NATIONAL-ARTS-CLUB.pdf "National Arts Club Designation Report"] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (March 15, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; [[brownstone]] at 15 Gramercy Park, next door to [[The Players (New York City)|The Players]], a club with similar interests. The National Arts Club is noted for allowing members access to a [[Gramercy Park#Key|Gramercy Park key]].

The National Arts Club  has several art galleries, and hosts a variety of outstanding programs in all artistic areas including theater, literature and music. Although the club is private, many of these frequent events are free and open to the public. 

The club's mansion headquarters was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in 1966,&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; and declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1647&amp;ResourceType=Building|title=Samuel J.

==History==
A group of friends, all of them involved in architecture, art, or civic affairs, discussed the possibility of a new kind of club that would embrace all the arts. The establishment of the Club came at a time when American artists were increasingly turning to their own nation rather than exclusively to Europe as a center of work and creativity. Significantly, the Club would offer full membership for women at the onset, reflecting their accomplishment in the arts.

While the group was working out an organizational plan, [[Charles DeKay]], the literary and art critic of the ''[[New York Times]]'' for 18 years, returned from a diplomatic post abroad. An inspired organizer and entrepreneur, he sent letters to men and women of importance in the New York area as well as in metropolitan areas across the country. The response was so enthusiastic that the Club was able to apply to Albany for its charter in 1898. With the application went a list of the officers, Board of Trustees, and members totaling more than 1200.

The list included such collectors as [[Henry Frick]], [[William T. Evans]], Benjamin Altman, [[Jules Bache]] and [[Henry Walters]]. Though not a charter member, [[J. Pierpont Morgan]] joined the Club early in its development and later was made an Honorary Vice President. Among the artists of the period, earlier charter members, or those joined in the early days of the Club were [[Frederic Remington]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]].

The Club's first home was a brownstone on West 34th Street. Commerce, meanwhile, was moving up from downtown, and the neighborhood of brownstones was changing. [[Spencer Trask]], its treasurer, was asked to find the Club a new home. He found that 14 and 15 Gramercy Park South, the former home of Samuel Tilden, was on the market. Legend has it that he was so afraid that some other buyer would also find it that he put down some money of his own to bind the bargain. In 1906, the Club acquired the [[Samuel J. Tilden House]].

Since the Summer 2006, the Mansion's stoop at 14 Gramercy Park has been under restoration. Recently, New York artist [[Sergio Rossetti Morosini]] sculpted a bust of [[Michelangelo]] for its façade.

==Controversy==
The president of the club from 1985 to 2011 was O. Aldon James.&lt;ref name="nyt-20010125"&gt;{{cite news

In September 2012, an 18-month investigation into the final five years of James' presidency by [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eric T. Schneiderman]] resulted in a $2 million lawsuit against James by the state, charging that he misused the club's funds and real estate for his own benefit.  The state charges that James used his control of the club to take over numerous real estate units under its auspices, and that he and his twin brother hoarded clothes, antiques and other valuable artifacts until their rooms could no longer be lived in.  According to the state, since 2006, James' activities cost the club $1.5 million in lost rentals, as well as a quarter of a million dollars the club provided for James' opulent lifestyle.  James also fraudulently used money from a fellowship fund to pay for repairs to the club's facade.  The state's complaint against James was near to a settlement in July 2012, until James rejected it. James also has two lawsuits of his own outstanding against the club.&lt;ref name=nytsep12&gt;Leland, John.

The state's investigation also resulted in agreements with the club for reforms, such as term limits on officers and board members, as well as changes in some of its real estate practices.  In addition the current president of the club, painter and philanthropist Dianne Bernhard, who took office in June 2011 when James was ousted, agreed to step down and leave the board once her term was up.&lt;ref name=nytsep12 /&gt;

{{Literature}}

A '''novella''' is a text of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a [[short story]] but shorter than a [[novel]], somewhere between 17,500 and 40,000 words.

The English word "''novella''{{-"}} derives from the Italian ''novella'', feminine of ''novello'', which means "new".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novella |title=Novella - Definition |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary online|accessdate= 7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novella is a common [[literary genre]] in several European languages.

==History==
The novella as a literary genre began developing in the early [[Renaissance]] by the Italian and French ''literatura'', principally [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], author of ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novella | title=Novella: Definition and history  |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary online| accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Decameron'' featured 100 tales (novellas) told by 10 people (seven women and three men) fleeing the [[Black Death]], by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors, notably the French queen [[Marguerite de Navarre]], whose ''[[Heptameron|Heptaméron]]'' (1559) included 72 original French tales and was modeled after the structure of ''The Decameron''.

Not until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a [[Realism (arts)|realistic mode]]. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the ''novelle'' (German: "Novelle"; plural: "Novellen").{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For the German writer, a novella is a fictional narrative of indeterminate length—a few pages to hundreds—restricted to a single, suspenseful event, situation, or conflict leading to an unexpected turning point (''Wendepunkt''), provoking a logical but surprising end. ''Novellen'' tend to contain a concrete symbol, which is the narrative's focal point.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Structure==
A novella generally features fewer [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] than a [[novel]], yet more complicated ones than a [[short story]]. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Novellas may or may not be divided into chapters (good examples of those with chapters are ''[[Animal Farm]]'' by [[George Orwell]] and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]]) and are often intended to be read at a single sitting, as is the short story, although in a novella white space is often used to divide the sections, and therefore, the novella maintains a single effect.&lt;ref name="bf1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kercheval|first=Jesse Lee|title=Building Fiction|publisher=Story Press|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|year=1997|chapter=Short shorts, novellas, novel-in-stories|isbn=1-884910-28-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Cariou]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The novella is generally not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of literature in Canada''. Edited by William H. New. University of Toronto, 2000. Page 835.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Versus novel==
:''See the article [[Novel]] for the historical generic debate''.
:''See the article [[Word count]] for comparative word counts''.

This etymological distinction avoids confusion of the literatures and the forms, with the novel being the more important, established fictional form.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]]'s ''[[The Royal Game|Die Schachnovelle]]'' (1942) (literally, "The Chess Novella", but translated in 1944 as ''The Royal Game'') is an example of a title naming its genre.

Commonly, longer novellas are referred to as novels; Robert Louis Stevenson's ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886) and Joseph Conrad's ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) are sometimes called novels,{{by whom|date=September 2014}} as are many [[science fiction]] works such as H. G. Wells' ''The War of the Worlds'' (1897) and  Philip Francis Nowlan's ''[[Armageddon 2419 A.D.]]'' (1928). Less often, longer works are referred to as novellas. The subjectivity of the parameters of the novella genre is indicative of its shifting and diverse nature as an art form.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In her 2010 ''[[Open Letters Monthly]]'' series, "A Year With Short Novels", Ingrid Norton criticizes the tendency to make clear demarcations based purely on a book's length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On a web search engine, input "novels" and "length" and you will find tables of word counts, separating out novels from novellas, even from the esoteric and still shorter "novelette"—as though prose works were dog show contestants, needing to be entered into proper categories. But when it comes to writing, any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size are bound to be misleading. The delicate, gem-like jigsaw of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey|The Bridge of San Luis Ray]]'' {{sic}} could not be more unlike the feverishly cunning philosophical monologue of [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Camus novel)|The Fall]]'', but both novels are about the same length.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/the-sweetness-of-short-novels/ The Sweetness of Short Novels]" by [http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/author/norton/ Ingrid Norton], Open Letters Monthly February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Stephen King]], in his introduction to ''[[Different Seasons]]'', a collection of four novellas, has called the novella "an ill-defined and disreputable literary banana republic";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first= Stephen|title=Different Seasons|publisher=Viking Adult|year=1982|isbn=978-0-670-27266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; King notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the commercial publishing world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers.  Despite these problems, however, the novella's length provides unique advantages; in the introduction to a novella anthology titled ''Sailing to Byzantium'', [[Robert Silverberg]] writes:

{{bquote|[The novella] is one of the richest and most rewarding of literary forms...it allows for more extended development of theme and character than does the short story, without making the elaborate structural demands of the full-length book.  Thus it provides an intense, detailed exploration of its subject, providing to some degree both the concentrated focus of the short story and the broad scope of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverberg, Robert|title=Sailing to Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= ibooks, inc.|date= 2000|isbn= 0-7861-9905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his essay, "Briefly, the case for the novella", Canadian author George Fetherling (who wrote the novella ''Tales of Two Cities'') said that to reduce the novella to nothing more than a short novel is like "insisting that a pony is a baby horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fetherling, George |url=http://www.sevenoaksmag.com/commentary/94_comm1.html |title=Briefly, the case for the novella |work=Seven Oaks Magazine |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120912031610/http://www.sevenoaksmag.com/commentary/94_comm1.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sometimes blurry definition between a novel and a novella can create controversy, as was the case with British writer [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[On Chesil Beach]]'' (2007). The author described it as a novella, but the panel for the [[Man Booker Prize]] in 2007 qualified the book as a "short novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ian McEwan claims the novella is better than the novel|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9608935/Ian-McEwan-claims-the-novella-is-better-than-the-novel.html|accessdate=27 September 2015|work=The Telegraph|agency=Telegraph Media Group Limited|issue=HOME»CULTURE»BOOKS»BOOK NEWS|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=&lt;!-- 11:29AM BST --&gt; 15 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this "novella" was shortlisted for an award for best original novel. A similar case is found with a much older work of fiction: ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903) by [[Jack London]]. This book, by modern standards, is short enough and straightforward enough to qualify as a novella. However, historically, it has been regarded as a novel.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Versus novelette==
Dictionaries define '''''novelette''''' similarly to ''novella''; sometimes identically,&lt;ref&gt;
[[American Heritage Dictionary]] (4th ed.): [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/novella novella (2)], [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/novelette novelette];
[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novelette novelette];
&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with a disparaging sense of being trivial or sentimental.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Collins Dictionary]]: [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/novella novella (2)], [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/novelette novelette (2)];
[[Macmillan Dictionary]] (US ed.): [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/novella novella], [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/novelette novelette];
[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] (UK ed.): [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/novella novella], [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/novella novelette]; novelette];
[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]: [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/novella?view=uk novella], [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/novelette?view=uk novelette];
[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]: [http://websters.yourdictionary.com/novella novella], [http://websters.yourdictionary.com/novelette novelette];
&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[literary award]]s have a longer "novella" and a shorter "novelette" categories, with a distinction based on [[word count]]. A range between 7,500 and 17,500 words is common among awards.&lt;ref name="nebularules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsfs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjarules"/&gt;

The '''Pearl District''' is an area of [[Portland, Oregon]], formerly occupied by [[warehouse]]s, light [[industry]] and [[railroad]] [[classification yard]]s and now noted for its [[art gallery|art galleries]], upscale businesses and residences.  The area has been undergoing significant [[urban renewal]] since the mid-1980s when it was reclassified as [[mixed use]] from industrial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshall-wells.com/historypearl3.html|title=Marshall-Wells Lofts &lt;&gt; History|author=|date=|website=www.marshall-wells.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225132726/http://www.marshall-wells.com/historypearl3.html|archivedate=25 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the arrival of artists, the removal of a [[viaduct]] and construction of the [[Portland Streetcar]]. It now mostly consists of high-rise [[condominium]]s and [[loft apartment|warehouse-to-loft conversions]].

The increase of high-rise condominiums and warehouse-to-loft conversions was made evident with the construction of the [[Cosmopolitan on the Park]] building, which opened in Summer 2016. The Cosmopolitan on the Park residential building is now the tallest building in the Pearl District and the 8th tallest building in Portland, contributing to the changing Portland skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextportland.com/2014/12/09/cosmopolitan-on-the-park/|title=North Pearl High-Rises, Part I: The Cosmopolitan on the Park (images)|last=Nextportland|date=2014-12-09|website=Next Portland|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202091637/http://www.nextportland.com/2014/12/09/cosmopolitan-on-the-park/|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is located just northwest of [[Downtown, Portland, Oregon|downtown]] between West Burnside Street on the south, the [[Willamette River]] on the north, NW Broadway on the east and the [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|Interstate 405]] [[freeway]] on the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandonline.com/oni/index.cfm?c=35281&amp;a=58616 |title=Pearl Neighborhood Association boundary map |format=[[PDF]] |date=June 1, 2001 |author=City of [[Portland, Oregon]] Office of Neighborhood Involvement/Bureau of Planning |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202094311/http://www.portlandonline.com/oni/index.cfm?c=35281&amp;a=58616 |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is home to several Portland icons, including [[Powell's City of Books]]. The former [[Henry Weinhard|Weinhard]] Brewery, which operated continuously from 1864 to September 1999, was shut down by Stroh's upon the purchase of the Weinhard's brand by [[Miller Brewing]] and sold for redevelopment as the Brewery Blocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectureweek.com/2005/0511/environment_1-1.html "Mixed Use Brewery Blocks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610011611/http://www.architectureweek.com/2005/0511/environment_1-1.html |date=2008-06-10 }}. Accessed online 16 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[List of artists and art institutions in Portland, Oregon|art galleries and institutions]] such as the Elizabeth Leach Gallery and [[Blue Sky Gallery]] (many who stage monthly receptions), boutiques, and restaurants abound, and also a number of small clubs and bars, a combination that has led to Pearl District being named one of the 15 coolest neighborhoods in the world in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 15 Coolest Neighborhoods in the World in 2016|url=http://www.howitravel.co/the-15-coolest-neighborhoods-in-the-world-in-2016/|accessdate=13 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203011043/http://www.howitravel.co/the-15-coolest-neighborhoods-in-the-world-in-2016/|archivedate=3 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Postal Service|United States Post Office]] main processing facility for all of Oregon and southwestern Washington was built in the Pearl District in 1964, next to [[Union Station (Portland)|Union Station]]. This location was chosen in order for the post office to be able to better serve towns outside the Portland metro area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The district includes most of the historic{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[North Park Blocks]] (1869), as well as three public plazas:
*[[Jamison Square]] (2002) is built around a fountain which simulates a tidal pool that is periodically filled by [[artificial waterfall]]s and then drained into grating.
*[[Tanner Springs Park]] (2005) is a re-created natural area featuring wetlands, a walking trail, and creek.
*[[The Fields Park]] (2013) is a Neighborhood and Dog Park in the Northern part of the Pearl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fields Park|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/index.cfm?c=44338|publisher=City of Portland|accessdate=12 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629014845/http://www.portlandonline.com/PARKS/index.cfm?c=44338|archivedate=29 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Park provides space for visual or performing arts, for community-building activities and has a large paved walking loop.

==History==
The area was formerly used for [[warehouse|warehousing]], light [[Industry|industrial]] purposes and a [[railroad]] yard and was known as the "Northwest Industrial Triangle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=29660 |title=More polish for the Pearl |author=Don Hamilton |work=[[Portland Tribune]] |date=April 29, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221234201/http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=29660|archivedate=February 21, 2008|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Lovejoy Viaduct, an elevated portion of NW Lovejoy Street from the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland, Oregon)|Broadway Bridge]] past NW 10th Avenue was demolished, opening dozens of surrounding blocks (including some [[brownfield]] sites) for development, which peaked in the 2000s.  The viaduct was notable for the [[Lovejoy Columns]], painted by a railroad watchman who worked below; two of them have been saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chatterbox.typepad.com/portlandarchitecture/2005/10/more_on_the_lov.html|title=More on the Lovejoy Columns|author=|date=|website=Portland Architecture|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604111614/http://chatterbox.typepad.com/portlandarchitecture/2005/10/more_on_the_lov.html|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing density has attracted a mix of restaurants, [[brewpub]]s, shops, and art galleries.

The origins of how the Pearl District got its name is still up for debate. According to the Pearl District Business Association, Thomas Augustine, a local gallery owner, coined the name Pearl District around the turn of the millennium to suggest that some of its urban decay industrial buildings were like crusty oysters, and that the galleries and artists' lofts within were like pearls. However, in 2002, Thomas Augustine amended his story, suggesting that the idea for the Pearl District came from his friend Pearl Marie Amhara who would throw parties for creatives in warehouses in what is now considered the Pearl District. Attendees started calling the area “Pearl’s place” and “Pearl’s District”. Local business people were looking to label the growing area and the name finally caught on when a writer for [[Alaska Airlines]] borrowed and popularized Augustine's phrase. The "warehouse district" or the "brewery district" were two other suggestions that are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2002/04/pearl_districts_namesake_was_a.html | work=[[The Oregonian]] | author=Margie Boule | date=April 14, 2002 | title=Pearl District's namesake was a jewel of a woman | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410221052/http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2002/04/pearl_districts_namesake_was_a.html | archivedate=April 10, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pearldistrict.org/pearl-district-name/|title=How Did the Pearl District Get Its Name?|date=2014-01-06|newspaper=Pearl District Neighborhood Association|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912063619/http://www.pearldistrict.org/pearl-district-name/|archivedate=2015-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989), by [[Gus Van Sant]], has several scenes shot in the neighborhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1361">'''Philosophy of design''' is the study of assumptions, foundations, and implications of [[design]].  The field is defined by an interest in a set of problems, or an interest in central or foundational concerns in design.  In addition to these central problems for design as a whole, many philosophers of design consider these problems as they apply to particular disciplines (e.g. [[philosophy of art]]).  Although most practitioners are [[philosopher]]s, several prominent [[designer]]s and [[artist]]s have contributed to the field. For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/en/cephad/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

The first [[cuneiform]] tablet recovered in the Damascus area was found at Tell Sakka. It was suggested resemble the style of cuneiform found in the archives of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and speaks of a king called [[Zimri-Lim]]. The cuneiform tablet in Sakka was translated to read ''"To my brother Zimri-lim, say "Thus saith Kanhilesu? Your brothers Samas and Dagan for the rest of the days, My brother sustenance? In front of me (it is) good. In front of my brother that is well! I heard: The enemy of my country brother, My brother has attacked, news of him that sent me! (...) inside a (?)

'''''Singing All Along''''' is a 2016 Chinese television series produced by [[Ruby Lin]], starring Lin and [[Yuan Hong (actor)|Yuan Hong]]. Set in 1st-century imperial China, the drama is based on Li Xin (李歆)'s 2007–2009 romantic novel series ''Xiuli Jiangshan'' (秀丽江山) and focuses on the relationship between Liu Xiu ([[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]), a peasant-turned-[[Eastern Han dynasty]] founder and [[Yin Lihua]] (Empress Guanglie), the love of his life. Although the original novel involved [[time travel]], the television series does not contain those parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2012-03-21/09303586070.shtml|title=林心如将投拍《秀丽江山》 删去穿越还原历史|publisher=Sina entertainment|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began in October 2013 in [[Xiangshan County, Zhejiang]], China with a budget of ¥150 million (over 24 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/13/1001/09/9A3E6FLB00014Q4P.html 林心如投1.5亿拍剧]&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered on [[Jiangsu Television]] on 21 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2016-05-12/doc-ifxsenvm0322451.shtml|title=林心如《长歌行》6月23日播 定档之路坎坷|publisher=Sina entertainment|date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In 22 AD, the peasant brothers Liu Yan and Liu Xiu led a rebel force to overthrow the oppressive [[Xin dynasty|Xin empire]] and to restore the [[Han dynasty]]. Yin Lihua, their beautiful childhood friend, joined their fight. During the bloody battles, Liu Xiu and Yin faced death many times together before the Xin empire was finally toppled. In 23, Liu Yan was seen by the new Han emperor Liu Xuan as a threat and killed. Fearing he would be next, Liu Xiu, with the help of his new bride Yin, managed to have Liu Xuan assign him to a territory beyond Liu Xuan's reach. However, developing a power base of his own proved difficult. In 24, Liu Xiu encountered a dilemma: in order to enter a military alliance with a mighty regional warlord, he needed to marry the warlord's niece Guo Shengtong and break his vows to Yin. Meanwhile, Yin discovered that Liu Xuan also had feelings for her. When Yin finally reunited with her husband in 25, Liu Xiu was already the new emperor who had just captured the capital; with Guo, a woman he did not love, as his new wife. As the empire remained divided, naming Guo the empress seemed the ideal choice politically, but Liu Xiu's heart never left Yin. Amid power struggle, war, and intrigues, could their love survive?

'''Software incompatibility''' is a characteristic of [[software]] components or [[Software system|systems]] which cannot operate satisfactorily together on the same [[computer]], or on different computers linked by a [[computer network]]. They may be components or systems which are intended to operate cooperatively or independently. [[Software compatibility]] is a characteristic of software components or systems which can operate satisfactorily together on the same computer, or on different computers linked by a computer network. It is possible that some software components or systems may be compatible in one environment and incompatible in another.

==Examples==
===Deadlocks===
Consider sequential programs of the form:

 Request [[Resource (computer science)|resource]] A
 Request resource B
 Perform action using A and B
 Release resource B
 Release resource A

A particular [[Computer program|program]] might use a [[Computer printer|printer]] (resource A) and a [[Computer file|file]] (resource B) in order to print the file.

If several such programs P1,P2,P3 ... operate at the same time, then the first one to [[Execution (computing)|execute]] will [[Blocking (computing)|block]] the others until the resources are released, and the programs will execute in turn. There will be no problem. It makes no difference whether a [[uniprocessor|uni-processor]] or a [[multi-processor]] system is used, as it's the allocation of the resources which determines the order of execution.

Note, however, that [[programmers]] are, in general, not constrained to write programs in a particular way, or even if there are guidelines, then some may differ from the guidelines. A variant of the previous program may be:

 Request resource B
 Request resource A
 Perform action using A and B
 Release resource A
 Release resource B

The resources A and B are the same as in the previous example &amp;ndash; not simply [[bound variable|dummy variables]], as otherwise the programs are identical.

As before, if there are several such programs, Q1,Q2,Q3 which run at the same time using resources as before, there will be no problem.

However, if several of the Ps are set to run at the same time as several of the Qs, then a [[deadlock]] condition can arise. Note that the deadlock need not arise, but may.

 P: Request resource A
 Q: Request resource B
 Q: Request resource A (blocked by P)
 P: Request resource B (blocked by Q)
 ...

Now neither P nor Q can proceed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is one kind of example where programs may demonstrate incompatibility.

===Interface incompatibility===
Another example of a different kind would be where one software component provides service to another. The incompatibility could be as simple as a change in the order of [[Parameter (computer science)|parameters]] between the software component requesting service, and the component providing the service. This would be a kind of [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] incompatibility. This might be considered a [[Software bug|bug]], but could be very hard to detect in some systems. Some interface incompatibilities can easily be detected during the [[Software build|build stage]], particularly for strongly [[Data type|typed]] systems, others may be hard to find and may only be detected at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], while others may be almost impossible to detect without a detailed program analysis.

Consider the following example:

  Component P calls component Q with parameters x and y. For this example, y may be an integer.

  Q returns f(x) which is desired and never zero, and ignores y.

A variant of Q, Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; has similar behaviour, with the following differences:

  if y = 100, then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not terminate.

If P never calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead is a compatible [[computation]].
However if P calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead will lead to a non-terminating computation. 

If we assume further that f(x) has a numeric value, then component Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; defined as:

  Q'' behaves as Q except that
  if y = 100 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not terminate
  if y = 101 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns 0.9 * f(x)
  if y = 102 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns a random value
  if y = 103 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns 0.

may cause problem behaviour. If P now calls Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with  = 101, then the results of the computation will be incorrect, but may not cause a program failure. If P calls Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with y = 102 then the results are unpredictable, and [[Crash (computing)|failure]] may arise, possibly due to [[Division by zero|divide by zero]] or other errors such as [[arithmetic overflow]].
If P calls Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with y= 103 then in the event that P uses the result in a division operation, then a divide by zero failure may occur.

This example shows how one program P1 may be always compatible with another Q1, but that there can be constructed other programs Q1' and Q1&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; such that P1 and Q' are sometimes incompatible, and P1 and Q1&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; are always incompatible.

===Performance incompatibility===
Sometimes programs P and Q can be running on the same computer, and the presence of one will inhibit the performance of the other. This can particularly happen where the computer uses [[virtual memory]]. The result may be that [[disk thrashing]] occurs, and one or both programs will have significantly reduced performance. This form of incompatibility can occur if P and Q are intended to cooperate, but can also occur if P and Q are completely unrelated but just happen to run at the same time. An example might be if P is a program which produces large output files, which happen to be stored in [[Computer data storage#Primary storage|main memory]], and Q is an anti-virus program which scans many files on the hard disk. If a [[CPU cache|memory cache]] is used for virtual memory, then it is possible for the two programs to interact adversely and the performance of each will be drastically reduced.

For some programs P and Q their performance compatibility may depend on the environment in which they are run. They may be substantially incompatible if they are run on a computer with limited main memory, yet it may be possible to run them satisfactorily on a machine with more memory. Some programs may be performance incompatible in almost any environment.

A '''statue of the Canadian jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]]''' is located at the corner of [[Elgin Street (Ottawa)|Elgin]] and [[Albert Street (Ottawa)|Albert]] streets in Ottawa, Canada, outside Canada's [[National Arts Centre]]. 

==Description==
The life size statue depicts Peterson sitting on a bench at a piano, smiling, and includes a space for visitors to sit next to him. The statue was intended to depict Peterson as if he had just finished playing and had turned toward his audience. The statue is made from bronze, and was created by the Canadian sculptor [[Ruth Abernethy]]. Abernathy said the statue was designed so that Peterson was "...very accessible to people who love him and that is an unabashed set-up to just have a moment with Oscar".&lt;ref name=CTVNews10&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/oscar-peterson-sculpture-captures-legend-s-joy-1.527988|title=Oscar Peterson sculpture captures legend's joy|date=30 June 2010|work=CTV News|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piano has 97 keys as opposed to the 88 keys on a standard piano, and is based on an Austrian piano that Peterson favoured. Abernethy intended the extra keys to represent a "metaphor for his musical inventiveness" as Peterson was a "...man who asked to reimagine the piano".&lt;ref name=TorStar10&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2010/06/29/knelman_oscar_petersons_piano_lives_on_in_ottawa.html|title=

==Unveiling==
It was unveiled on the 30 June 2010 by the reigning [[Monarchy of Canada|sovereign of Canada]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], during her nine-day tour of Canada. Peterson had performed for Elizabeth during her Canadian tour to celebrate her [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee in 2002]]. The queen met Peterson's wife, Kelly Peterson, and his daughter, Celine, at the unveiling ceremony, and the Montreal Jubilation Choir performed his composition "Hymn to Freedom". Kelly Peterson said that her reaction to the statue was "...like walking in and seeing him. It's amazing how it works like that" and that it was "It's an overwhelming honour for Oscar. I'm so proud and pleased about that".&lt;ref name=CTVNews10/&gt;

==Recent history==
The statue was vandalized in August 2014 by two people who painted tears with gold paint onto Peterson's eyes.&lt;ref name=OtCit14/&gt; An outdoor concert was held by the statue in August 2015 to celebrate Peterson's 90th birthday.&lt;ref name=OtCit15&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/local-arts/the-timeless-appeal-of-oscar-peterson|title=

'''''The Flag''''' is a painting by [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] (1918), that represents her anxiety about her brother being sent to fight in Europe during [[World War I]], a war that was particularly dangerous due to the uses of new and especially dangerous weapons and tactics, like [[mustard gas]], [[naval mine]]s, high-powered guns, and [[Aviation in World War I|aerial combat]]. It was not displayed until 1968, in part because anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; It is in  the collection of the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!387953~!0#focus|title=The Flag|website=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.mam.org/details.php?id=9929|title=The Flag|website=Milwaukee Art Museum|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|text=Everything seems to be whirling or unbalanced—I'm suspended in the air—can't get my feet on the ground... I should think going to war would be a great relief from this everlasting reading about it—thinking about it—hearing talk about it—whether one believed in it or not—it is a state that exists and experiencing it in reality seems preferable to the way we are all being soaked with it second hand—it is everywhere… it's all like a bad dream.|author=—Georgia O'Keeffe in a letter to [[Paul Strand]].&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Robinson|author2=Georgia O'Keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC&amp;pg=PA192|year=1989|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-0-87451-906-8|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1918, O'Keeffe was in a state of depression and anxiety about the war and did not paint for three months. While she understood why it was important militarily, she found it at odds with [[humanism]] and basic [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Robinson|author2=Georgia O'Keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1989|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-0-87451-906-8|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keeffe's brother, Alexius&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; or Alexis, was stationed in a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during [[World War I]]. She visited him in the fall of 1917 before he was shipped overseas, and was anxious about his fate.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; He was one of the first soldiers sent to France and did not believe that he would return to the United States alive.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191" /&gt; In France war had become very dangerous due to chemical and technologically advanced weapons. Poisonous gases were used against troops, which could kill, blind, or severely injure them. High-powered and long-range guns could cause significant destruction. Submarines planted mines in the seas and airplanes dropped weapons from the sky.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/arts/design/review-world-war-i-the-quick-the-dead-the-artists.html|title=World War I — The Quick.

O’Keeffe found herself at odds with people in [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]] about the war and was discouraged by attempts to glorify it.&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; She tried to persuade her male students to continue their education, rather than fight in the war&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191" /&gt; and she also wanted authorities to create a course for young men about the reasons and causes of war before they engaged in battle.&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; She created a stir when she asked a shop owner to remove Christmas cards from his shop that expressed anti-German sentiment.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; O'Keeffe became quite ill from [[influenza]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], which had killed an estimated 20 million people worldwide, and took a leave of absence from her teaching position at the [[West Texas State Normal College]] in early 1918 to recuperate at a friend's ranch in San Antonio,&lt;ref name="ABJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/156926133/|title=Watercolors Expand View of O'Keeffe|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|author=Malin Wilson|via=newspapers.com|date=April 16, 1998|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she painted ''The Flag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Hopkin Reily|title=Georgia O’Keeffe, A Private Friendship, Part I: Walking the Sun Prairie Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2gHBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|date=December 1, 2014|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-1-63293-042-2|pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Flag'', both a political statement and a reflection of her fears, is a red streak "bleeding into bruise-colored clouds".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In December 1917, she wrote that she felt compelled for the first time to paint from a sense of necessity. Her image for the painting was of a flag floating in the wind, similar to a tremble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgia O'Keeffe|author2=Alfred Stieglitz|title=My Faraway One: Selected Letters of Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz: Volume One, 1915–1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkuyi_Fg3YC&amp;pg=PA446|date=June 21, 2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16630-9|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Roxana Barry Robinson]] states, "O'Keeffe sets a drooping flag against a starless, darkening sky. The flag flutters limply, stripped of its stars and stripes; its only color, and that of the pole, is blood red."&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; Alexis died in France due to the effects of mustard gas.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]],&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; and people living in Canyon were uneasy due to her anti-war position.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; ''The Flag'' was in the private collection of Mrs. Harry Lynde Bradley in October 25, 1968, when it was part of a [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] exhibition, and was acquired by the museum in 1977.&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt; The painting is included in the "World War I and American Art" exhibition opened by the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in January 2017. After about a four-month run it will travel to the [[New-York Historical Society]], where it will be shown until September 3, 2017.&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

'''''The Siege''''' is a Palestinian play developed and devised by [[The Freedom Theatre]]. It recounts the story of the 2002 [[Siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Ariel |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cohen042402.asp |title=The Nativity Sin |publisher=National Review Online |date=April 24, 2002 |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817045355/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cohen042402.asp |archivedate=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Tour==
In May 2015, The Freedom Theatre embarked on its first ever tour of the UK. The Siege was the biggest touring production ever performed in Britain by a Palestinian theatre company.

The UK tour was organized by The Freedom Theatre UK Friends, a network of over 300 people in Britain who are engaged in the theatre’s activities. The Siege and its UK tour are supported by the EU, the British Council, Steps Beyond – European Cultural Foundation, Arts Council England and The Roddick Foundation. Other supporters include the playwright, [[Howard Brenton]] and film-maker, [[Ken Loach]].

Funding by [[Arts Council England]] angered local Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.K. funding of Palestinian play angers local Jewish community|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/1.654750|agency=Haaretz|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish actress [[Maureen Lipman]] joined pro-Israel groups including [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]] in a protest outside the London premiere of ''The Siege'' at [[Battersea Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firsht|first1=Naomi|title=Maureen Lipman joins protest outside theatre staging The Siege|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/136602/maureen-lipman-joins-protest-outside-theatre-staging-the-siege|agency=Jewish Chronicle|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatre Rhinoceros''' or '''Theatre Rhino''' is a gay and lesbian theatre based in San Francisco.  It was founded in the spring of 1977 by Lanny Baugniet (who became the theater's General Manager) and his partner Allan B. Estes, Jr. (who became the theater's Artistic Director).  It is a non-profit theater company dedicated to the production of plays by and about [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] people.

Theatre Rhinoceros is the first gay theater company to employ actors under a professional seasonal agreement. The company was recognized by the [[California State Assembly]] on its twenty-fifth anniversary and again as a pioneering organization at the twenty-fifth anniversary remembrance of assassinated [[San Francisco]] Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]].

__TOC__

==History==
Their first production, mounted in August 1977, was [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]'', at the [[Gay Community Center]] (then located at 330 Grove Street in San Francisco, now the site of the Performing Arts Parking Garage), produced by Baugniet, and directed by Estes. That first season continued with ''Gays at Play'', ''Stone Rhino'', ''Gayhem'', and [[David Guerdon]]'s ''The Laundry'', directed by Baugniet. The operating budget for that first year was $3,900 — an amount which doubled every year for the company's first seven years of operation to $250,000 for its 1983–1984 season.

===1978–1979 season===
The 1978–1979 season opened with a revamping of ''Gays at Play'', which consisted of [[LeRoi Jones]]' ''The Baptism'' (directed by Estes) and [[Fred Puliafito]]'s ''Para de Noya'' (directed by Baugniet) — but it was the monumental success of the next production, [[Doric Wilson]]'s ''West Street Gang'' (performed at the South of Market leather bar The Black &amp; Blue), that won the company's first [[Cable Car Award]] and enabled the company to establish residence in its first home at the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco, California|Goodman Building]] at 1115 Geary Street. The season concluded with ''Male Rites'', which included [[C.D. Arnold]]'s ''Downtown Local'', [[Robert Chesley]]'s ''Hell, I Love You'', [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''The Great Nebula in Orion'', and [[Cal Yeomans]]'s ''Richmond Jim'', which production also toured to New York.

===1979–1980 season===
The 1979–1980 season was dedicated to a festival of plays by [[Robert Patrick]] which included ''See Other Side'', ''Fred and Harold'', ''The Loves of the Artists'', ''Haunted Host'', ''Kennedy's Children'', ''T-Shirts'', and ''My Cup Ranneth Over''. The season concluded with [[Doric Wilson]]'s ''A Perfect Relationship''. By this time, Baugniet had written successful grants for the fledgling theater company from the City &amp; County of San Francisco, the [[California Arts Council]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and he had formulated a successful subscription campaign that was second only in numbers to the [[American Conservatory Theater]] in the San Francisco Bay Area.

===1980–1981 season===
The 1980–1981 season consisted of [[Doric Wilson]]'s ''Forever After'', [[Joel Schwartz]]'s ''Power Lines'', [[Noel Grieg]]'s ''The Dear Love of Comrades'', [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s ''The International Stud'', [[Victor Bumbalo]]'s ''Kitchen Duty'' and ''American Coffee'', and [[Arch Brown]]'s ''News Boy''. Theatre Rhinoceros also opened its studio theater during this season with [[Cal Yeomans]]' ''The Line Forms to the Rear'' and [[Dan Curzon]]'s ''Beer and Rhubarb Pie'', and hired its third full-time employee, Raleigh Waugh, as Technical Director.

===1981–1982 season===
The 1981–1982 season opened with [[C.D. Arnold]]'s ''Dinosaurs'', the final production at the Goodman Building, after which the company moved into its quarters at the [[Redstone Building]] at 2926 16th Street. The inaugural productions in the company's new theatre were [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s ''Fugue in a Nursery'' on the main stage and [[Robert Chesley]]'s ''Stray Dog Story'' in the studio. The remaining main stage productions for that year were [[George Birimisa]]'s ''Pogey Bait'', [[Doric Wilson]]'s ''Street Theater'', [[Noël Coward]]'s ''Design for Living'', and a revival of ''T-Shirts''.

===1982–1983 season===
The 1982–1983 main stage season consisted of Robert Graham's ''Sins of the Father'', [[Jane Chambers]]' ''My Blue Heaven'', [[Arthur Laurents]]' ''The Enclave'', [[Victor Bumbalo]]'s ''Niagara Falls'', [[C.D. Arnold]]'s ''King of the Crystal Palace'' (one of the first produced plays to deal with [[AIDS]]), and a revival of ''A Perfect Relationship''.

===1983–1984 season===
The 1983–1984 main stage season included Bill Russell's ''Fortune'', [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[Vieux Carré]]'', [[Jane Chambers]]' ''A Late Snow'', [[Richard Benner]]'s ''Crystal Blaze'', [[Adele Prandini]]'s ''Safe Light'', [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''[[5th of July]]'' (it was during the run of this play that Estes died of AIDS), and Richard Gray's ''Bad Drama''.

After Estes' death, Baugniet turned the theater over to his staff and retired into private life. Including studio productions and staged readings, he had produced over one hundred titles for the theater company. Baugniet's papers are housed at the [[GLBT Historical Society]] in San Francisco and the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

===1984–1990===
Under the artistic direction of Kristine Gannon (1984–1987), The Rhino continued to realize Estes' vision. Committed to exploring the impact of AIDS on the gay community, The Rhino produced several important new plays, including the collaboratively written ''[[The AIDS Show]]: Artists Involved with Death and Survival'' and an updated version titled ''Unfinished Business'' that was the subject of a [[PBS]] documentary by [[Rob Epstein]] and [[Peter Adair]], [[Doug Holsclaw]]'s ''Life of the Party'' and ''The Baddest of Boys'', [[Leland Moss]]'s ''Quisbies'', Robert Pitman's ''Passing'', [[Anthony Bruno]]'s ''Soul Survivor'', and the [[Henry Mach]]–Paul Katz (not to be confused with cellist [[Paul Katz]]), musical ''Dirty Dreams of a Clean-Cut Kid'', as well as cult classics like [[Tom Eyen]]'s ''[[Women Behind Bars]]''. Charles Solomon (1987-1988) and Kenneth R. Dixon (1988-1990) expanded The Rhino's boundaries of inclusiveness by staging several [[African-American]] productions.

===1990–1999===
Under the leadership of Artistic Director Adele Prandini (1990–1999), the Rhino forged partnerships with many groups, including Luna Sea, Teatro de la Esperanza, Black Artists Contemporary Cultural Experience, The Asian AIDS Project, and the Latino/a AIDS Festival. It received commendations from the City of Berkeley, the City and County of San Francisco, and the State of California on its fifteenth and twentieth anniversaries. 

Prandini continued as an artistic force writing and directing ''Coconut'', directing [[Chay Yew]]'s ''[[Porcelain (play)|Porcelain]]'' and ''Beyond Bagdad'', a wildly successful musical written by Pamela Forrest and Doug Holsclaw. Holsclaw continued as Rhino's most important male writers, with works including ''Don't Make Me Say Things that will Hurt You'', directed by Sabin Epstein, ''Out Calls Only'', ''The Plunge'', and ''The Sensational Sin Sisters'', directed by Prandini, and ''The Last Hairdresser'', directed by [[Danny Scheie]], which won a Critics Circle Award (tie) for Best New Play.

===1999–2003===
Doug Holsclaw (1999–2003) presided over the premiere of new works by [[Marga Gomez]], Latin Hustle, Jason Post, John Fisher, F. Allen Sawyer, Marvin White, and Guillermo Reyes. The entire twenty-fifth anniversary season was celebrated with world premiere works by Johari Jabir, Sara Moore, Fisher, [[Kate Bornstein]], and [[Ronnie Larsen]] as well as special performances by [[Kate Clinton]] and Gomez.

===2004–2009===
Now in its twenty-ninth year and under the artistic direction of Fisher, Theatre Rhinoceros remains committed to Allan Estes' original vision of developing and producing works of theatre that enlighten, enrich, and explore all aspects of the gay community.

2004 saw the first full American staging of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''Single Spies'' (two one-acts: "[[An Englishman Abroad]]" and "[[A Question of Attribution]]"), which was co-directed by John Fisher and Jeffrey Hartgraves. Featuring John Fisher, Jeffrey Hartgraves, Libby O'Connell, Matt Weimer, Greg Lucey, and Dominick Marrone.

2005 featured the holiday production of [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart]]'s classic farce ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'', starring a collection of some of the Bay Area's best-known local actors, including Floriana Alessandria, David Bicha, P. A. Cooley, Matthew Martin, Kim Larsen, Matt Weimer, Libby O'Connell, and Jeffrey Hartgraves.

2006 featured the remounting of the critically acclaimed ''Family Jewels: the Making of Veronica Klaus'' by [[Jeffrey Hartgraves]] and Veronica Klaus, directed by Jeffrey Hartgraves. This production was subsequently brought back for another run in 2007.

2007 brought innovation and experimentation with the creation of The Studio Project ''There's Something About Marriage'' which explored the issues and opinions surrounding the topic of gay marriage. Conceived and created by John Fisher, David Bicha, and Maryssa Wanlass. With cameos by Drew Todd, Jeffrey Hartgraves, and Matthew Martin. This year also saw the first staging of ''Shark Bites (a very nearly solo show)'' written by and starring Jeffrey Hartgraves. Directed by Libby O'Connell and featuring Drew Todd, P. A. Cooley, David Bicha, davidmahr, and T.J. Lee. This show was remounted in 2008.

===2009–present===
In 2009, the rising cost of rent caused Theatre Rhino to vacate the Redstone Building. Subsequent shows have been produced at multiple venues across San Francisco, primarily at the Eureka Theater at 215 Jackson Street.

A '''unit production manager''' ('''UPM''') is the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]]–approved title for the top [[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]] staff position, responsible for the administration of a [[feature film]] or television production. Non-DGA productions might call it the '''production manager''' or '''production supervisor'''. They work closely with the [[line producer]]. Sometimes the line producer is the UPM. A senior producer may assign a UPM more than one production at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DGA 2011 Basic Agreement |year=2011 |publisher=Directors Guild of America |location=Los Angeles, California |pages=13 |url=http://www.dga.org/Contracts/~/link.aspx?_id=7D5BFF125CE044E6B049F7E2B1A4FD70&amp;_z=z|chapter=1-302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility to a senior producer==
A UPM is usually hired by a [[film producer]] or [[television producer]], and is responsible for managing the production and regulating the costs of delivering the expected film or television show on budget at the end of principal photography. Based on a shooting script, the UPM will create a working budget during [[pre-production]], prior to the start of [[principal photography]], thereby charting a recommended budgetary course. Typically, a producer will oversee all the cost-related decisions, including [[Above the line (film production)|above-the-line]] expenditures (especially during [[pre-production]]). However, the UPM is responsible for the more detailed planning and execution of the [[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]] costs (primarily for physical production). The film's [[Film director|director]] will select important department heads (keys) or support personnel related to his work, including the [[casting director]], [[cinematographer]], [[costume designer]], [[production designer]], and [[film editor]]. For below-the-line matters, the UPM often negotiates deals (for location, equipment, etc.) and hires the remaining crew, typically on the recommendation of the keys and/or based on prior experience with trusted individuals.

The UPM frequently does not have any direct responsibilities with the creative direction of the film's narrative, although in some cases he will and can be consulted.  Many budget decisions affect the creative direction of the project. He or she is to support the director's artistic vision on a daily physical production level.

Before principal photography begins both the producer and UPM work to secure as many of the production elements as possible, including a workable schedule and budget. Usually from a production office during pre-production, they may later divide their time between the office and the set while the film is being shot. An on-set trailer may also be used as a makeshift production office. Like nearly all members of a film crew, UPMs will typically remain on the shoot until the end of principal photography and can return if there are any reshoots. It is not atypical for a UPM to work 80-100 (or more) hours per week while a film is in production.

In the [[United States of America|US]], a union UPM is represented by [[The Directors Guild of America]]. Certain conditions must be adhered to on a union shoot in order to remain in good standing with the DGA. These include expected salary rates, working hours, overtime penalties, required meals and other related criteria.

Highly experienced UPMs bring great value to a project for their strategic and creative problem-solving skills. These individuals will positively affect the film's budget as well as the final outcome and quality of the film on multiple levels.

==Duties==
The UPM, under the supervision of the employer, is required to coordinate, facilitate and oversee the preparation of the production unit or units (to the extent herein provided) assigned to him or her, all off-set logistics, day-to-day production decisions, locations, budget schedules and personnel. Without limitation, among the duties which the Employer must assign to the UPM or First Assistant are the supervision of or participation in the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DGA 2011 Basic Agreement|year=2011|publisher=Directors Guild of America|location=Los Angeles, California|pages=13–15|url=http://www.dga.org/Contracts/~/link.aspx?_id=7D5BFF125CE044E6B049F7E2B1A4FD70&amp;_z=z}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prepare breakdown and preliminary shooting schedule.
* Prepare or coordinate the budget.
* Oversee preliminary search and survey of all locations and the completion of business arrangements for the same.
* Assist in the preparation of the production to ensure continuing efficiency.
* Supervise completion of the Production Report for each day's work, showing work covered and the status of the production, and arrange for the distribution of that report in line with the company's requirement.
* Coordinate arrangements for the transportation and housing of cast, crew and staff.
* Oversee the securing of releases and negotiate for locations and personnel.
* Maintain a liaison with local authorities regarding locations and the operation of the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7075">The '''Wagner Murals''' are the name for over 70 [[mural]] fragments illegally removed from the [[Pre-Columbian]] site of [[Teotihuacán]] in the 1960s.

== Murals of Teotihuacan ==
The murals of Teotihuacán are very different from artistic representations found in neighboring centers.  Few aspects of daily life are represented; the murals are predominantly abstract depictions of mythical deities that probably reflect a communal belief system.  Teotihuacán is also unique in the fact that, even though it is contemporaneous with initial Mayan centers, there are relatively few hieroglyphic inscriptions.  [[Esther Pasztory]], of the Teotihuacán Murals Project, has postulated that they wanted to create an art style distinctly different the preceding Olmec culture and the contemporaneous Mayan centers.  They were not interested in displaying a succession of kingship as commonly shown in other cultures of the area.

Early murals at the site are generally found located in small temples along the Avenue of the Dead and depict animals such as [[quetzal]]s and [[felidae|feline]]s as well as various plant varieties.  During the [[Xolalpan]] stage of Teotihuacán (~AD 400), however, murals could be found in a wider variety of structures including many porticoes of apartment compounds.  Additionally, themes of mythical supernatural deities and the increase in hieroglyphic notations led Pasztory to conclude that this change may mark a sort of decentralization within the society.

The Wagner Murals may help to show this process of decentralization.  One of the best examples of this transition comes from the ''Feathered Serpents and Flowering Trees'' mural.  While there are depictions of serpents and floral aspects common in early Teotihuacán artwork, within the flowering trees there are relatively rare depictions of simple [[glyph]]s.  In all, there are four feathered serpents (two from the Wagner Collection) that accompany nine plants each.  It has been suggested from some scholars that these nine plants with nine different glyphs may represent the nine lords of the underworld.  It also may be one of the first references of the migration myth of the eight tribes of the [[Aztec]]s leaving the cave of origin.

Another predominant theme represented in a number of the Wagner Murals is the image of a figure wearing a three-tassel [[headdress]].  Thought to be connected with independent collections called the St. Louis and San Francisco Collections respectively, these figures are presumed to be originally found in [[Techinantila]] compound of Teotihuacán.  Additional figures of similar form and colorations are found in the Houston and Milwaukee Collections.  All of the figures are facing to the right and disks are placed at regular intervals above the depictions.  If the proportions of this room were equivalent to those found in Teopancaxco (9mx3.4m), then this mural would have contained 20 figures surrounding the room, possibly led by the Storm God.  Additionally, various glyphs under many of these tasseled headdresses may denote the individual names with which they are associated.  As there are no discernible borders at the corners where the mural would be adjoined, these figures are thought to have been read continuously as one viewed them from wall to wall.  A border of footprints along the top of the mural pieces helps to strengthen this notion.

While the figures in this particular group seem to represent specific people or [[deity|deities]] in Teotihuacán, the three-tassel headdress also seems to become a symbol for the people themselves.  In distant areas like Tikal, for example, this three-tassel motif also shows up.  On [[Stela 31]] there is a depiction of what may be a military figure with a shield that is adorned with this very symbol.  On a further note, the Storm God is always shown with the tassel headdress.  Additionally, there are connections of the headdress to [[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan|Great Goddess]] as seen in the [[Tetitla]] compound.  This helps to show how these murals, while out of context, can help growing scholarship on interpretation.  These murals could aide in Pasztory's notion of the transition in Teotihuacán culture.  In the time of the Wagner Murals, iconography was used denote communal ideology and individual identification as well.

Almost all of the fragments were traced back in 1983 and 1984 by Rene Millon to the [[Techinantitla]] compound, some 500 yards east of the Avenue of the Dead and Pyramid of the Moon.  The remainder of the fragments were traced by Millon to the [[Tlacuilapaxco]] compound.

== Origin of the Collection ==
[[Harald Wagner]] was born in [[Falls City, Oregon]] in 1903.  He later went on to obtain a degree in [[Architecture]] from the [[University of Oregon]] at Eugene.  In 1927, Wagner moved to [[San Francisco]] and went to work as a draftsman for the architectural firm of Bliss &amp; Faville.  It was here that Wagner became adamantly interested in [[art]].  Influenced by his mentor, William Faville, and Arthur and Lucia Mathews, popular decor artists in the area, Wagner began to learn and collect art from around the world.  In the 1950s, he traveled for the first time to [[Mexico]] where he fell in love with the country and its people.  He eventually purchased a house there where he lived part-time.  It was here that, in the mid-1960s, he began to acquire a collection of mural pieces from the city of Teotihuacán.  His combined love of architecture and its various artistic components fueled his collective spirit and his collection quickly grew to over seventy pieces.  Although it seems that his original intention of this collection was to sell it for profit, increased awareness of the ethical implications of acquiring such collections nullified their marketability.  In the end, Wagner donated the entire collection to the [[de Young Museum]] in San Francisco as part of his will shortly following his death in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Ron|title=Looted|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/321933/|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230338/http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/321933/|archivedate=2014-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the collection has been extensively studied by numerous academics of Teotihuacán culture.  Because of excessive looting at the site of Teotihuacán, scholarship has been very difficult to undertake.  Very few murals were known ''in situ'' before the emergence of the Wagner Murals.  However, they may eventually help us to fully understand the artistic depictions created by the people of Teotihuacán.
