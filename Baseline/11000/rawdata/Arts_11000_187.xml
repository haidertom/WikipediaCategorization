The year '''1965 in film''' involved some significant events, with ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' topping the U.S. box office.

==Events==
* February 15 - [[George Stevens]]' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', a retelling of the account of [[Jesus Christ]], premieres in [[New York City, New York]]. It was such a flop with critics and audiences that its failure discouraged production of religious epics for many years. It is considered notable in the 21st century for its astonishing landscapes, powerful and provocative cinematography, [[Max von Sydow]]'s debut acting performance in an American film, and the final film performance of [[Claude Rains]].
* March 2 - The [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] film adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], premieres. It quickly became a worldwide phenomenon and an instant classic. It successfully displaced ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' to become, at the time, [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|the highest-grossing film of all-time]]. ''The Sound of Music'' is credited as the film that saved and restored [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] from bankruptcy after it suffered from extremely high production costs and low revenue of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' two years prior.
* July 1 - [[Blake Edwards]]'s epic comedy ''[[The Great Race]],'' starring [[Tony Curtis]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Keenan Wynn]], premieres. Initially a flop with critics and audiences, some do admire Edwards' direction, the acting by its ensemble cast, [[Henry Mancini]]'s music and its climactic pie fight.
* December 22 - [[David Lean]]'s film adaptation of [[Boris Pasternak]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', starring [[Omar Sharif]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Rod Steiger]], and [[Alec Guinness]], premieres and, like ''The Sound of Music'', quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Its moral story and message of a love and human spirit that defied the communist Soviet Union have made the film a true classic with critics and audiences. It was included among top films by the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|American Film Institute]]. In a decade of very difficult times for its studio, ''Zhivago'' became the most successful and acclaimed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film since ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]];'' it was the greatest MGM film since ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.

An '''act''' is a division or unit of a [[theatre]] work, including a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[opera]], and [[musical theatre]]. The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Life of Plays|last=Waters|first=Steve|publisher=Nick Hern Books|year=2010|isbn=978 1 84842 000 7|location=London|pages=32|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. The former use of the term may or may not align with the latter. The word ''act'' can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as [[variety show]]s, [[television]] programs, [[music hall]] performances, and [[cabaret]].

==Acts and scenes==
An '''act''' is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax and resolution.:&gt;&gt; A [[scene (drama)|scene]] is a part of an act defined with the changing of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130409233719/http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-09 |title=Plays, Acts and Scenes in Structure |last=Sherlock |first=Karl |publisher=Grossmont College |date=2005 |work=English 160: Drama Writing |accessdate=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more specific, the elements that create the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play or any story, and divide a play into acts include the exposition, which give information, setting up the rest of the story. Another is the inciting incident, which starts all of the action that will follow. Going along with the inciting incident, the major dramatic question is formed; this holds the rest of the play. The majority of the play is made up of complications. These are the things that change the action. These complications lead up to the crisis, this is the turning point. Most of the time, at this point, the major dramatic question has been answered. Finally, there is the resolution. This is the end of the play where everything comes together and the situation has been resolved. This leaves the audience satisfied with the play as a whole. These more specific elements of plot in a play are the main things used to divide a play up into acts and sometimes scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Novic, J. (2012). Drama. In World book advanced. Retrieved from http://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was the first to divide [[Play (theatre)|plays]] into a number of acts separated by intervals. Acts may be further divided into [[scene (drama)|scenes]]; in classical theater each regrouping between entrances and exits of actors is a scene, while later use describes a change of setting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Though there are no limits to the number of acts which might exist within a dramatic work, the most common formats are the three-act and five-act structures.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Both of these are derived from different interpretations of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' in which he stresses the primacy of plot over character and "an orderly arrangement of parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.1.1.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Poetics by Aristotle|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern plays often have only one level of structure, which can be referred to as either scenes or acts at the whim of the writer; and some writers dispense with firm divisions entirely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Successive scenes are normally separated from each other in either time or place; but the division between acts is more to do with the overall dramatic structure of the piece. The end of an act often coincides with one or more characters making an important decision, else having an important decision to make. A decision which has a profound impact on the story being told.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Contemporary theatre, in line with screenwriting and novel forms, tends towards a [[three-act structure]]. Many [[operettas]] and most [[musical theatre|musicals]] are divided into just two acts, so in practice the [[intermission]] is seen as dividing them, and the word "act" comes to be used for the two halves of a show whether or not the script divides it into acts.

==Varieties==

=== One-act plays ===

A [[one-act play]] is a short drama that consists of only one act; the phrase is not used to describe a full-length play that does not utilize act-divisions. Unlike other plays which usually are published one play per book, one-act plays are often published in anthologies or collections.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Three-act plays ===
{{See also|Three-act structure}}

In a three-act play, each act usually has a different tone to it. The most commonly used structure is the first act having a lot of introductory elements, the second act can usually be the darkest with the antagonists having a greater encompass, while the third act is the resolution and the protagonists prevailing. There is an age-old saying that "the second act is the best" because it was in between a starting and ending act and thus being able to delve deeper into more of the meat of the story since it does not need to have as prominent introductory or resolutive portions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is not always so, since a third act or even a first act can have the common second act characteristics, but that type of structure is the most used.
* Act one: In Act I the conflict of the story is discovered. In this act, the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], the introduction of the [[protagonist]], and other characters that the protagonist meets take place,&lt;ref name="Cannell"&gt;Cannell, S. J. (n.d.). What is the three act structure? [Lecture transcript].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Premise (film)|dramatic premise]] and inciting incident (the incident that sets the events of the story in motion) occurs approximately halfway through the first act.
* Act two: The main character encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This is known as the complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point and seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective and it seems like there is no longer any way that the protagonist can succeed.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;
* Act three: The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] occurs as well as the [[dénouement]], a brief period of calm at the end of a play where a state of equilibrium returns. It is simply the resolution.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;

=== Five-act plays ===
Until the 18th century, most plays were divided into five acts. The work of [[William Shakespeare]], for example, generally adheres to a five act structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare and Five Acts: studies in a dramatic convention|last=Snuggs|first=Henry L.|publisher=Vantage Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . This format is known as the [[Dramatic structure|five-act play]], and was famously analyzed by [[Gustav Freytag]] in ''Die Technik des Dramas'' (Dramatic techniques). The five acts played specific functions in the overall structure of the play; but in performance there was not necessarily any clear separation between them.

A similar five-part structure is also used in traditional Japanese [[Noh]] drama, particularly by [[Zeami Motokiyo]]. Zeami, in his work "''[[Sandō]]''" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five ''dan'') Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (''jo''), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (''ha''), with the greatest climax in the third ''dan'', and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth ''dan'' (''kyū'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Shelley Fenno|date=Spring 1993|title=How to write a Noh play - Zeami's ''Sandō''|journal=[[Monumenta Nipponica]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=58–62|jstor=2385466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
As part of a [[television program]], each individual act can be separated by commercials.
In [[film]], a number of scenes grouped together bring to an audiovisual work to life. The three act structure is commonly referred to in [[film adaptation]] of theatrical plays.

'''Anders Petters stuga''' or '''Anders Petters stuga står i ljusan låga''' is an old [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Christmas music|Christmas song]] of unknown origin. It is often sung when dancing around the [[Christmas tree]]. Alternate lyrics are '''Anders Perssons stuga'''. Lyrical, the song deals with a fire in "Anders Petters'" [[cottage]]. While the lyrics don't mention [[Christmas]], the words "ljusen" are here strongly associated with the [[candle]]s lit at Christmastime.

'''''Babakiueria''''' (also known under the video-title '''''Babakiueria (Barbeque Area)''''') is a 1986 [[Australian]] [[satire|satirical]] film on relations between [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australians]] and [[European Australian|Australians of European descent]].

==Synopsis==
''Babakiueria'' revolves around a role-reversal, whereby it is Aboriginal Australians who have invaded and [[colonization|colonised]] the fictitious country of Babakiueria, a land that has long been inhabited by white natives, the Babakiuerians.

The opening scene depicts a group of Aboriginal Australians in military uniforms coming ashore in a land they have not previously been to. In this land, they discover a number of European Australians engaged in stereotypical European Australian activities. The Aboriginal Australian explorers approach the group and the expedition's leader asks them, "What do you call this place"? One of the Europeans replies, "Er... '[[Barbecue]] Area'".

After around 200 years of Aboriginal occupation, white Australians have become a minority. Aboriginal people have assumed power, taken all of the available land and have mostly confined whites to suburban [[ghettos]]. They are expected to follow the laws and customs of the colonisers and their lifestyle is seen through the patronizing eyes of the majority culture. The latest [[wikt:manifest|manifestation]] of this is in a 'documentary' presented by Duranga Manika ([[Michelle Torres (actor)|Michelle Torres]]).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abccommercial.com/librarysales/program/babakiueria |title="Babakiueria" |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radio.adelaide.edu.au/babakiueria-a-satirical-tale-of-the-invasion-of-the-white-peoples-land/ |title=""BabaKiueria" – a satirical tale of the invasion of the white people’s land" |publisher=[[Radio Adelaide]] |date=26 January 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/troufs/anth1604/video/Babakiueria.html |last=Roufs |first=Timothy |title="Babakiueria" |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Duluth]] |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the film follows Duranga Manika as she observes how white people are disempowered through poverty, are treated unfairly by the police - often with [[Police brutality|brutality]] and indifference, experience arbitrary dispossession, government inaction on white issues, white [[tokenism]], [[Stolen Generation|white children being taken from their families]] only to be taught the values of the majority culture and white people being relocated because the government needs their home for "something". White people are now often characterized by society and in the media as lazy, unintelligent and untrustworthy and anyone who protests about the current circumstances is labeled as a 'troublemaker'. White rituals and cultural values are derided and dismissed as violent and meaningless. The Babakiuerian government's [[paternalistic]] policies are defended by Wagwan, the Minister for White Affairs ([[Bob Maza]]) who was based on the then [[Premier of Queensland]], [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen|Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen]].&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NFSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/shorts/babakiueria/notes/ |last=Matthews |first=Kate |title="Babakiueria (1986)" |publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]] |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.edu.au/education/files/5313/8724/1953/Julius_Caesar.pdf |title="Cambridge Checkpoints HSC Advanced English" |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inversion of reality in ''Babakiueria'' highlights the unfairness of Australia's past and present Aboriginal policies and the entrenched racism in society. This subversion of normality allows viewers to see what is wrong when one group tries to control and dominate another and questions the fairness of the current power structure in Australia.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt;

==Production==
Much of ''Babakiueria'' was filmed on location, including the Anzac March and the 'Ritual of Violence' ([[Australian Football League|AFL]] Game). It was screened in the [[Australian Museum]] for many years.&lt;ref name="NFSA" /&gt;

==Impact and Reception==
''Babakiueria'' has been used at times to educate police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativespirits.info/resources/movies/babakiueria-barbecue-area |title="Babakiueria ("Barbecue Area")" |publisher=www.CreativeSpirits.info |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After it was screened at the Message Sticks Festival in 2012, Mahjid Heath noted that "issues we were struggling with in the early 80's are still relevant and still define the political and national discourses today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/indigenous/stories/s3471253.htm |last=Heath |first=Mahjid |title="Message Sticks Festival 2012" |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The tradition of tortoise-mounted stelae originated no later than early 3rd century (late [[Han dynasty]]).
According to the 1957 survey by Chêng Tê-k'un (鄭徳坤), &lt;!-- there is [[:de:Zheng Dekun]] already.... --&gt;
the earliest extant tortoise-borne stele is thought to be the one at the tomb of Fan Min (樊敏), in [[Lushan County, Sichuan|Lushan County]], [[Ya'an]], [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name=cheng&gt;{{citation

The author's name would be spelled Zheng Dekun in Pinyin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Segalen]] had earlier identified the stele as a [[Han dynasty]] monument; present-day authors agree, usually giving it the date of 205 AD.&lt;ref name=seg68&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|1995|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Robert E. |last=Harrist|publisher=University of Washington Press |year=2008

The ''bixi'' tradition flourished during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasties]]. The Ming founder, the [[Hongwu Emperor]], in the first year after the dynasty had been proclaimed (1368), adopted regulations, allowing tortoise-based funerary tablets to the [[Mandarin square|higher ranks]] of the [[Chinese nobility|nobility]] and the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarinate]]. He tightened the rules in 1396, leaving only the highest nobility (those of the ''gong'' and ''hou'' ranks) and the officials of the [[mandarin square|top 3 ranks]] eligible for ''bixi''-based stelae. The type of [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] crowning the tortoise-born stele, and the type and number of other statuary at the tomb site, were prescribed by the same regulations as well.&lt;ref name=deGroot2&gt;{{citation

At the Hongwu Emperor's [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum|own mausoleum]], a huge ''bixi'' holding the so-called ''Shengde'' stele welcomes visitors at the Sifangcheng pavilion at the entrance of the mausoleum complex. Three centuries later (1699), the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty visited Nanjing and contributed another tortoise, with a stele praising the founder of the Ming, comparing him to the founders of the great Tang and Song dynasties of the past.&lt;ref name=pd2003&gt;[http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html 明孝陵两大“碑石之谜”被破解] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018052502/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html |date=2012-10-18 }} (Solving the two great riddles of the Ming Xiaoling's stone tablets).

The Hongwu Emperor's tortoise tradition was continued by the later Ming and Qing emperors, [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties|whose mausoleums]] are usually decorated by ''bixi''-born steles as well.

Even the self-declared emperor [[Yuan Shikai]] was posthumously honored with a ''bixi''-based stele in [[Anyang]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynews.net.cn/jray/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=3736  洹园里的破嘴龟] (The tortoise with a broken mouth in Huanyuan Park) {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] Premier [[Tan Yankai]] (1880–1930), whose stele near [[Nanjing]]'s [[Linggu Temple]] had its inscription erased after the Communist Revolution.

Occasionally, a foreign head of state was honored with a ''bixi'' as well, as it happened to the sultan of [[Brunei]] [[Abdul Majid Hassan]], who died during his visit to China in 1408. The [[Tomb of the King of Boni|sultan's grave]], with a suitably royal ''bixi''-based monument, was discovered in Yuhuatai District south of [[Nanjing]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Rozan Yunos, [http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china "The Brunei Sultan who died in China"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319185326/http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china |date=March 19, 2009 }} The Brunei Times, 9.11.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After an [[Nestorian Christian|ancient Christian stele]] was unearthed in [[Xi'an]] in 1625, it, too, was put on the back of a tortoise.

These days, long-lost bixi continue to be unearthed during archaeological excavations and construction work. Among the most remarkable finds is the discovery of a huge 1200-year-old in [[Zhengding]] ([[Hebei]] Province) in June 2006. The stone turtle is 8.4 m long, 3.2 m wide, and 2.6 m tall, and weighs 107 tons.

The concept of a tortoise-borne, dragon-crowned stele was early adopted by China's northern neighbors. The earliest extant monument of the
[[Göktürks|Turkic Kaganate]] - the so-called "Bugut Stele" of the late 6th century from [[Arkhangai Province]] in western [[Mongolia]] with a [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and (most likely) [[Sanskrit]] inscription was installed on a stone tortoise. It is now in the provincial capital, [[Tsetserleg (city)|Tsetserleg]].&lt;ref name=bugut&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=2&amp;lang=e The Tatpar (Kutlug) kagan memorial complex, 581-582]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alyilmaz&gt;Dr. Cengiz Alyilmaz, [http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/alyilmaz.html On the Bugut Inscription and Mausoleum Complex]. Ēran ud Anērān: Studies presented to Boris Ilich Marshak on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday. Compareti, Raffetta, Scarcia - Editors. Electronic Version (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Turkish researcher Cengiz Alyilmaz, it was the design of this stele that influenced the builders of the important 8th-century stelae with [[Old Turkic script|Old Turkic]] inscriptions, many of which also stood on tortoises.&lt;ref name=alyilmaz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Bazylkhan  [http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?lang=e&amp;mod=1&amp;tid=1 The Orhon Inscriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, the most accessible one is probably [[Bayanchur Khan]]'s (Eletmish Bilge Kağan)'s [[Tariat inscriptions|Terhin-Gol stele]] (753 AD), now in the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in [[Ulan Bator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=24&amp;lang=e  Inscription El etmish Bilge kagan (Tariat // Terh)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)]] and the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] erected tortoise-based monuments as well, some of which have been preserved in Russia's [[Ussuriysk]] and Mongolia's [[Karakorum]].

In Japan, this form of tortoise-supported stele is found primarily at the graves of prominent [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) figures, especially in the city of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. Another large collection of tortoise-borne stelae, spanning 17th through 19th centuries, can be seen at the cemetery of the [[Tottori Domain]] ''[[daimyō]]'' outside [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]]. Otherwise, the form does not seem to have been particularly popular in earlier or later times.

In Korea, tortoise-borne stelae are known already during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period (e.g., the Tombstone of King [[Muyeol of Silla]], erected 661).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cha.go.kr/korea/heritage/search/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,00250000,37 경주 태종무열왕릉비(慶州 太宗武烈王陵碑)] (Includes photos of Korean monuments) {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monuments of this type have been preserved from the later [[Goryeo]] dynasty as well, such as the [[Stele of Bongseon Honggyeongsa]] (1026).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackmoon.tistory.com/292 봉선홍경사사적갈비 (奉先弘慶寺事蹟碣碑); 성주사낭혜화상백월보광탑비 (聖住寺郎慧和尙白月보光塔碑)] (Includes photos of Korean monuments) {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam also has a long tradition of tortoise-born stelae, where they [[:commons:Category: Vinh Lang stele|commemorate]] emperor [[Lê Lợi]] as well as the graduates of the Confucian academy at Hanoi's [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]].

While there is no indigenous tradition of erecting stelae on tortoise-shaped pedestals in the United States, a Qing period ''bixi'' can be seen on campus of the [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. [[Harvard Bixi|This bixi]] was given as a gift to Harvard in 1936 by the members of Harvard Clubs in China; an appropriate text was carved for the occasion on the tablet carried by the tortoise.

==Development as an art form==
According to [[Victor Segalen]]'s assessment, the early ([[Han dynasty|Han]] and the [[Six Dynasties]]) stone tortoises were artistic images of quite real aquatic turtles.&lt;ref name=seg68/&gt; The creatures looked quite realistic through the [[Song dynasty]], when huge tortoise pedestals, such as the ones in [[Shou Qiu]] near [[Qufu]], or the one in [[Dai Miao]] at [[Mount Tai]] were erected.

The early-Ming specimens, while still definitely [[Green sea turtle|chelonian]], had sprouted small ears; sides of their heads and their [[carapace]]s are often decorated by a leaf-like design. They usually have prominent teeth, which real-life turtles don't.&lt;ref name=lishuai/&gt;
By the mid-[[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (the 18th century), however, the stele-bearing tortoise becomes the characteristic [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed ''bixi''.

According to some 19th-century western authors, the Chinese tradition of using a tortoise as a pedestal may have a common source with the Indian legend of the world being held up by a giant turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LoNAAAAIAAJ
|title=The Chinese reader's manual: A handbook of biographical, historical, mythological and general literary reference
|first= William Frederick|last= Mayers|year=1874|location=Shanghai|publisher=American Presbyterian Mission Press
|page=94}}, section 299 ("Kwei, 龟"). Quote: "The conception is probably derived from the same source with that of the Hindoo legend of the tortoise supporting an elephant, on whose back the existing world reposes." Mayers is also quoted in: {{citation|first=Charles Alfred Speed|last= Williams|title=Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs: An Alphabetical Compendium of Antique Legends and Beliefs, as Reflected in the Manners and Customs of the Chinese|publisher= Tuttle Publishing|year= 1988|ISBN= 0-8048-1586-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wV_3WRPC3gQC|page=405}} (reprint of the 1941 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The word ''bi'' 贔 or ''bixi'' 贔屭 (also written with a variant character, 贔屓) is translated by Chinese dictionaries as "strong", "capable to support great weight". The word ''bixi'' is attested already in [[Zhang Heng]]'s (78-139) "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (''Xi Jing Fu''), which mentions "the great strides" of the giant divine ''bixi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Western Metropolis Rhapsody" ([[:zh:s:西京賦|西京賦]]), Quote: "綴以二華，巨靈贔屓，高掌遠蹠，以流河曲，厥跡猶存". Quoted also in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Zhang Heng's follower [[Zuo Si]] (250 - 305) in his ''[[Eastern Wu|Wu]] [[Jiankang|Capital]] [[Fu (poetry)|Rhapsody]]'' (''Wu Jing Fu'') explicitly associates the attribute ''bixi'' with the legendary giant turtle ''[[ao (turtle)|ao]]'', whose head supports a sacred mountain.&lt;ref&gt;"Wu Capital Rhapsody" ([[:zh:s:吳都賦|吳都賦]]), Quote: "巨鼇贔屓，首冠靈山" (Giant ''Ao'' ''bixi'' [i.e. 'mighty'], [his] head holds up a sacred mountain). Quoted also in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bixi'' became associated with the stele-carrying tortoises no later than the [[Ming dynasty]]. The terminology, however, did not immediately become stable. The earliest known Ming-era list of fantastic creatures appearing in architecture and applied art is given by [[Lu Rong]] (1436–1494) in his ''Miscellaneous records from the bean garden'' (椒园杂记, ''Shuyuan Zaji''). The ''bixi'', with the syllables swapped (屭贔, ''xibi''), appears in the first position in that list:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''xibi'' looks like a tortoise. By its nature it likes to carry heavy weights.  It used to be employed to support stone tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lu Rong]]'s  ''Shuyuan Zaji'' is quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "屭赑其形似龟，性好负重，故用载石碑". The full text of ''Shuyuan Zaji'' can be found at a number of sites online, e.g. here: [http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html  菽園雜記] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306151643/http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lu Rong claims that his list (including the total of 14 creatures) is based on the ancient books of beasts and supernatural creatures, the ''[[Shan Hai Jing]]'' and the ''Bo Wu Zhi'' (博物志); however, as the modern researchers Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong note, that is not the case, and the names, much more likely, were taken by Lu Rong from the folklore of his times.&lt;ref name=yang2008&gt;[[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Lu Rong, the mighty tablet-carrying tortoise appears in various lists of the "[[Chinese dragon#Children of Dragon|Nine children of the Dragons]]", compiled by several Ming authors. However, both [[Li Dongyang]] (1441–1516) in his ''Huai Lu Tang Ji'' and Xie Zhaozhe ([[:zh:謝肇淛|謝肇淛]], 1567–1624) in his ''Wu Za Ji'' ([[:zh:五雜俎|五雜俎]], ''Five Assorted Offerings'', ca. 1592), refer to the tortoise that carries the stele by the name ''baxia'' (霸下), rather than ''bixi''; at the same time they apply the name ''bixi'' to the "literature-loving" dragons that appear on the sides of the stele:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''baxia'' has an innate love for carrying weights; the creature [that] now [is] under tablets is its image. ... The ''bixi'' has an innate love for literature; the dragons [that] now [are] on the sides of tablets are its image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Dongyang]]'s  ''Huai Lu Tang Ji''  (怀麓堂集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "霸下平生好负重，今碑座兽足是其遗像。... 赑屭平生好文，今碑两旁龙是其遗像。"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''bixi'', however, is given to the table-carrying tortoise in the more popular version of the list of the "Nine Children of the Dragon". In this form of the list, given e.g. by [[Yang Shen]] (1488–1559), the ''bixi'' is given the first position:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''bixi'' looks like a tortoise, and likes to carry heavy weights; [he] is the tortoise-carrier (''guifu'') now [seen] under stone tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yang Shen]]'s ''Sheng'an Ji'' (升庵集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "赑屭形似龟，好负重，今石碑下龟蚨是也。"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stone tortoises in art and popular lore==
The great stone tortoises, whose antiquity sometimes went farther into the history than anyone could remember, often made impression on people who saw them, and excited their curiosity. It is said that an old legend of the stone tortoise made by [[Lu Ban]] that went to swim in the ocean every summer, and came back to its seaside hill in the fall, inspired [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]]'s lines:
&lt;ref name=deGroot4_341&gt;{{citation

}}. The legend, and the reference to [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]], comes from the book ''Shu Yi Ji'' (述异记, "Extraordinary stories"), commonly ascribed to [[Ren Fang]] (460—508). The story from the tortoise from a seaside hill  (海畔石龜), as well as the one about another sea-going stone turtle from [[Linyi]] County  (臨邑縣), and their translations to [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], can be found [http://www.fulan.com/167/ebook/classic/taipinggj/tpgj374.html here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712014209/http://www.fulan.com/167/ebook/classic/taipinggj/tpgj374.html |date=July 12, 2006 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

M.A. thesis, Arizona State University, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French poet and researcher [[Victor Segalen]] (1878–1919), who published both a scholarly book about China's stelae&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of poetry-in-prose about them,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was also impressed by the "truly emblematic" stone tortoises, their "firm gestures and [[elegy|elegiac]] posture".&lt;ref name=segalen&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2007|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the image of the ''bixi'' continues to inspire modern Chinese artists.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Zhijie, [https://archive.is/20130131212441/http://www.qiuzhijie.com/image/Performance/nanjing/shiban/%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5%E4%B9%8B%E5%9F%8E.JPG "City of failure"] - the print is based on the Sifangcheng pavilion in the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation concerns==
As with other stone (particularly, marble and limestone) statuary, ''bixi'' turtles and their stelae are vulnerable to [[acid rain]] (or, in winter, acid snow). On the Harvard University campus, the curators of [[Harvard Bixi|its turtle]] protect it against the "acid snow" by wrapping it with a waterproof cover for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]" , Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A more ''bixi''-specific concern is the wear to the creatures' noses from the people who touch them for good luck. At Hanoi's [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], highly popular with visitors, this has become a sufficient concern to the site's managers as to make them develop plans for introducing creative landscaping and structural obstacles to keep visitors from touching the temple's 82 stone turtles.&lt;ref name=lishuai&gt;The custom of rubbing ''bixi'' for good luck (or, rather, protection from bag luck) is attested elsewhere e.g. in: 
李帅 (Li Shuai), 毛朝青 (Mao Chaoqing), [http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150114/42931143_0.shtml 赑屃不是龟. 专职驮石碑] (Bixi is not a turtle. Its special duty is to hold a stone table), 海峡都市报, 2015-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2012/09/hanois-stone-turtles-at-risk/ |title=Hanoi’s stone turtles at risk

'''Book-and-record sets''' are a form of entertainment for children, consisting of a picture storybook (often in [[comic book]] format, with drawings or photos) and an accompanying recording (originally in the form of a [[vinyl record]]; later in [[cassette tape]] and [[compact disc]] formats) to be played while following along with the book. The record and book complement one another, with the record usually a [[radio theater]]-style version of the story or a [[soundtrack]] recording, and the book providing visuals and text to the story. Often a tone or other kind of cue in the recording will prompt the reader to turn pages.

Book-and-record sets are popular as teaching tools and aids to reading, and as a simple form of [[multimedia]] entertainment. [[Cartoon characters]] are common subjects (or stars) of the stories, as are comic book [[superhero|superheroes]] and other [[Franchise (media)|media franchises]], characters and personalities. Occasionally popular children's or family movies are adapted for book and record; the stories may either be re-presented by a new cast of performers, members of the movie cast, or the audio taken directly from the movie, with narration added.

[[Disneyland Records]] and related companies produced several such works, as did [[Peter Pan Records]] (and its offshoot [[Power Records (Peter Pan records)|Power Records]]) and others, from the dawn of [[long-playing records]] and the [[45rpm single]] until the digital age. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Capitol Records]] produced many book-and-record sets for children, ranging from everything from [[Bozo the Clown]] to the classical music fantasy ''[[Sparky's Magic Piano]]''. A "picture storybook" of the 1982 movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' narrated by [[Michael Jackson]] became a highly prized [[collectible]], after it went out of print. Newer sets may still be found among recordings for children.

'''Castellani House''' is a large nineteenth-century building, which is situated on the corner of Vlissengen Road and Homestretch Avenue in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]. It was designed and constructed by the Maltese architect, [[Cesar Castellani]], between 1879 and 1882.

==History==

Castellani House was designed and built in by [[Cesar Castellani]], who was one of the most prominent and prolific architects of the colonial era in [[British Guiana]].  It was originally designed as a residence for the government [[botanist]], [[George Samuel Jenman]].  Dissatisfied with the original design of the house, Jenman refused to move into the residence until the changes he demanded had been implemented.  These changes were completed in 1882, and Jenman moved into the house in that year. After Jenman died, Castellani House was used as the official residence for Directors of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baksh /&gt;

In 1942, the house was extended with the addition of a third storey to the original two.  In 1965, further changes were made to the structure of the house by the Guyanese architect, Hugh McGregor Reid.&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;

From 1965 to 1985, Castellani House was the Official Residence for Prime Minister [[Forbes Burnham]] and First Lady, Viola Burnham.  During this time it was known simply as "the Residence".&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTG&gt;{{cite web|last=National Trust of Guyana|title=Historic Bourda|url=http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/new/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=163|work=National Trust of Guyana Official Website|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a major refurbishment, Castellani House was re-opened as the home of the National Art Gallery in 1993.&lt;ref name=Kandasammy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Creighton /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTG /&gt;  The Gallery's first curator was Everley Austin (1994-1996).  Austin was followed by Elfrieda Bissember (1996-present).&lt;ref name=Creighton /&gt;

==Art collection==

Castellani House holds over 700 works of art.  The collection includes work by [[Frank Bowling]], [[Edward Rupert Burrowes|E. R. Burrowes]], [[Stanley Greaves]], [[Bernadette Persaud]], [[George Simon (artist and archaeologist)|George Simon]], [[Denis Williams]] and [[Aubrey Williams]].&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baksh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Creighton /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, are officially scrapped or fell in [[development hell]].
== 1980s ==

=== ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King'' ===
In 1985, Columbus wrote an script for a third ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' film entitled ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932803/100-wonderful-and-terrible-movies-that-never-existed|title=100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus' script was about the trip of Indy along his assistant Betsy to a secret city protected by soldier gorillas and governed by the evil [[Monkey King]]. According to Columbus, he wrote the script so that the story doesn't look like the previous film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31313/lost-scripts-part-i-indiana-jones-and-monkey-king|title=The Lost Scripts, Part I: Indiana Jones and the Monkey King|date=26 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end, Columbus' script was rejected and the film was finally released in 1989 under the title ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

== 1990s ==

=== ''Fantastic Four'' ===
In 1995, Columbus wrote for [[20th Century Fox]] a script for the long time planned ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' feature-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/voices/columns/columbus-seeing-red-after-nine-reviews-1117862735/|title=Columbus seeing red after ‘Nine’ reviews|first=Army|last=Archerd|date=13 July 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was supposed to be released around the 2001 summer. [[Peter Segal]] was attached to direct it, but later, he dropped the project, so [[Raja Gosnell]]  took the director's chair, but he dropped it after being hired by [[Warner Bros.]] to direct ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and [[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed|its sequel]]. After this, director [[Peyton Reed]] entered into the project and wanted to cast [[Renée Zellweger]] as [[Invisible Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therobotsvoice.com/2015/02/fantastic_four_marvel_chris_columbus_dr_doom_miles_teller_kate_mara_michael_b_jordan_tim_story.php|title=9 Things Fox Got Right With Their 1996 Fantastic Four Script...That We Never Got to See - The Robot's Voice|date=11 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|film]] was finally released in 2005, directed by [[Tim Story]] and written by [[Michael France]] and [[Mark Frost]].

=== ''Galaxy High School'' ===
Plans for a live-action film adaptation of his own 1986 animated TV series [[Galaxy High]] was planned in partnership with [[John H. Williams]] of [[Vanguard Films &amp; Animation|Vanguard Films]], and reteamed with Chris Columbus to develop the big screen version of ''Galaxy High School''. After various development deals with both [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], Sofare nothing ever came out of it, either being scrapped or in [[development hell]].

=== ''Daredevil'' ===
In 1997, Columbus was hired by [[Columbia Pictures]] to write an script for a ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/26/daredevil-the-man-without-ed|title=Daredevil: The Man Without Ed|first=|last=Stax|date=26 April 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus' script was later leaked on Internet in 1999. Despite this, Columbia dropped the project and [[20th Century Fox]] bought the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/movies|title=Movie Reviews, Trailers, Interviews, Wikis &amp; Posters for Movies - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was finally released in 2003 and directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]].

== 2000s ==

=== ''The Sub-Mariner'' ===
In July 2004, Columbus was hired to direct a film adaptation of [[Namor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/news/columbus-off-to-sea-1117914347/|title=Columbus off to sea|first=Claude|last=Brodesser|date=3 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was supposed to be released in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/87061-marvels-film-slate-from-3rd-quarter-report|title=Marvel's Film Slate From 3rd Quarter Report - SuperHeroHype|date=28 October 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, Columbus abandoned the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/89791-chris-columbus-passes-on-sub-mariner|title=Chris Columbus Passes on Sub-Mariner - SuperHeroHype|date=12 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Webcomic xkcd - Wikipedian protester.png|thumb|right|250px|[[xkcd]] webcomic titled "Wikipedian Protester"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://xkcd.com/285/ |title= Wikipedian Protestor|author= Randall Munroe |accessdate= 20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

== Styles ==

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science. A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1123–1127 |publisher= |location= |year=2006 |url= |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl189 |id= |pmid=16987841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J. Scott Armstrong |work=Interfaces |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=125–139 |date=2008 |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |location=Catonsville, Maryland |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/45579289_Verification_of_Citations_Fawlty_Towers_of_Knowledge/links/00b7d52b08d80022a0000000.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-17 |dead-url=no |format=PDF |doi=10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |issn=0092-2102 |eissn=1526-551X |jstor=25062982 |oclc=5582131729 |ssrn=1941335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising.

The '''coat of arms of Manitoba''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]. The arms contains symbols reflecting Manitoba's British heritage along with local symbols. At the upper part of the shield is the red cross of St. George, representing England. The lower portion of the shield features a buffalo standing atop a rock on a green background.

The original arms, consisting of only the shield, were granted by [[royal warrant (document)|royal warrant]] of King [[Edward VII]] on 10 May 1905.&lt;ref name="EmblemAct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CanHeritage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/atc-ac/mb_e.cfm|title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols across Canada|author=Canada Heritage|accessdate=2 September 2008|date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms were further augmented with supporters, a crest, and motto, by a warrant of then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Ramon Hnatyshyn]] on  23 October 1992. 

The shield also features on the [[Flag of Manitoba|provincial flag]].

'''''Colossal Youth''''' ({{lang-pt|'''Juventude em Marcha'''}}, literally "Youth on the March") is a 2006 [[docufiction]] [[feature film]] directed by Portuguese director [[Pedro Costa]]. The film was shot on [[DV]] in long, static takes and mixes documentary and fiction storytelling. The third feature by Costa set in [[Lisbon]]'s Fontainhas neighborhood (after ''[[In Vanda's Room]]'' and ''[[Ossos|Bones]]''), ''Colossal Youth'' is a meditation on the aftermath of the [[Carnation Revolution]] and its consequences for Portugal's poverty-stricken [[Cape Verde]]an immigrants. It was part of the Official Competition at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4360212/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Colossal Youth |accessdate=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
After the Portuguese government demolishes his slum and relocates him to a housing project on the outskirts of Lisbon, 75-year-old Cape Verde immigrant Ventura wanders between his new and old homes, reconnecting with people from his past.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5608">The '''Cresson Traveling Scholarship''', also known as the '''William Emlen Cresson Memorial Traveling Scholarship''', is a two-year scholarship for foreign travel and/or study awarded annually to art students at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Awarded for excellence, the prize was funded by Emlen and Priscilla Cresson in memory of their son William Emlen Cresson, an Academy alumnus who died in 1868 at the age of 23.  He had been a child prodigy painter who began exhibiting at the Academy at the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;James-Gadzinski, Susan and Mary Mullen Cunningham, ‘’American Sculpture in the Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts’’, Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, 1997 p. 65 - 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Cresson Traveling Scholarships were awarded in 1902. Initially, they were $1,000 one-year scholarships, renewable for a second year, and sometimes beyond. Multiple awards were given in painting, along with one in sculpture and one in architecture. Awards in illustration were added later.

Cresson European Scholarships of $5000 for summer travel, were also awarded annually. These were not as prestigious as the two-year scholarships, with which they are often confused. 

[[Laura Wheeler Waring]], the first African-American woman to win a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, was studying in Paris in 1914 when [[World War I]] broke out. Subsequent winners were allowed to postpone their travel until the conflict was over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rd0T303qF90C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=winners+%22Cresson+Traveling+Scholarship%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kOV98S13_a&amp;sig=5D1uMx0no6CYXqaOMCoiVQApHyU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gc9oUfDBHea-2AXchIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=winners%20%22Cresson%20Traveling%20Scholarship%22&amp;f=false Pennsylvania impressionism - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Declaration of Independence''''' is a {{convert|12|by|18|ft|adj=on}} [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting by American [[John Trumbull]] depicting the presentation of the [[wikt:draft|draft]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] to [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]]. It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=yale69/&gt; 
Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life, and visited [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] to depict the chamber where the [[Second Continental Congress]] met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]] in 1826.

The painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The painting shows the [[Committee of Five|five-man drafting committee]] presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.&lt;ref&gt;John Hazelton, "The Historical Value of Trumbull's - 'Declaration of Independence' ", [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA30&amp;id=tv47AAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' - Volume 31], (Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1907), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also depicted several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], who declined to sign. Trumbull had no portrait of Benjamin Harrison V to work with, but his son Benjamin Harrison VI was said to resemble his father, so Trumbull painted him instead. As the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men featured in the painting never were in the same room at the same time.

In the painting, [[Thomas Jefferson]] appears to be stepping on [[John Adams]]' foot in the painting, which many thought was supposed to symbolize their relationship as political enemies. However, upon closer examination of the painting, it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the [[United States two-dollar bill|two-dollar bill]] version.

[[Image:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|200px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Elegance''' is [[beauty]] that shows unusual [[effectiveness]] and [[simplicity]]. It is frequently used as a standard of [[Taste (sociology)|tastefulness]] particularly in the areas of [[visual design]], [[decorative arts|decoration]], the sciences, and [[Mathematical beauty|the aesthetics of mathematics]]. Elegant things exhibit refined [[wiktionary:grace|grace]] and suggest maturity.

==General concept==
Essential components of the concept include [[simplicity]] and [[consistency]] of [[design]], focusing on the [[Essence|essential]] features of an object. In art of any kind one might also require dignified grace, or restrained beauty of style.

Visual stimuli are frequently considered elegant if a small number of [[color]]s and stimuli are used, emphasizing the remainder.

==In philosophy of science==
In the [[philosophy of science]], there are two concepts referring to two aspects of simplicity. Elegance ([[syntactic simplicity]]) means the number and complexity of hypotheses. [[Occam's razor|Parsimony]] ([[ontological simplicity]]) is the number and complexity of things postulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==

The [[mathematical proof|proof]] of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]] exhibits [[mathematical elegance]] if it is [[Surprise (emotion)|surprisingly]] simple yet effective and constructive; similarly, a [[computer program]] or [[computer algorithm|algorithm]] is elegant if it uses a small amount of code to great effect.&lt;ref name="programming1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=113 |title=ITLOG Import: Elegance |last1= Perrin |first1=Chad |date=16 August 2006 |publisher=Chad Perrin: SOB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="programming2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/15.html |title=Elegance |last1=Spolsky |first1=Joel |date=15 December 2006 |publisher=Joel on Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In engineering==

In [[engineering]], a solution may be considered elegant if it uses a non-obvious method to produce a solution which is highly effective and simple. An elegant solution may solve multiple problems at once, especially problems not thought to be inter-related.&lt;ref name="engineering1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzeldes.com/Miscellany/Elegance.htm |title=Ingenious simplicity |last1=Zeldes |first1=Nathan |year=2007 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |publisher=Nathan's Possibly Interesting Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In chemistry==

In [[chemistry]], chemists might look for ''elegance'' in theory and method, in technique and procedure. For example: elegance might comprise creative parsimony and versatility in the utilization of resources, in the manipulation of materials, and in effectiveness in syntheses and analysis.

==In pharmacy==

In [[pharmacy]], elegance in [[formulation]] is important for quality as well as effectiveness in [[dosage form design]], a major component of pharmaceutics.

[[File:Eugène Verboeckhoven Selbstporträt 1854.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1854)]]
'''Eugène Joseph Verboeckhoven''' (9 June 1798&amp;nbsp;– 19 January 1881), a [[Belgium|Belgian]] painter, was born at [[Warneton, Belgium|Warneton]] in [[West Flanders]]. He was a painter, a sculptor, an etcher, an engraver, and a lithographer of animals, animated landscapes, and portraits.

==Biography==
Eugène Verboeckhoven studied under his father, Barthélemy Verboeckhoven, a sculptor. In 1816 he worked under Voituron in [[Ghent]]. In the first half of the 19th century, the salons were a home for burgeoning art. Verboeckhoven was a regular participant at the Ghent (1820 and 1824) and Brussels Salons (1827–1860). He visited the Ardennes, France, Great Britain (1826), Germany (1828) and Italy (1841). He was held in high repute and elaborated on the works of artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste De Jonghe|De Jonghe]], [[Pieter-Frans De Noter|De Noter]], [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Koekkoek]], [[Jean Augustin Daiwaille|Daiwaille]], Kheelhof, Verheyden, and his pupils Louis-Pierre Verwee and the [[Charles-Philogène Tschaggeny|Tschaggeny]] brothers. He was a member of the academies of Brussels, Ghent, [[Antwerp]], [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Verboeckhoven was an excellent painter of animals and, together with his pupils, appears to have been the last link to a secular tradition with its roots deep in the 17th century, which linked observation of nature, studied composition, and idealized reproduction of reality. Like the Old Masters, he obtained the colour blue for his skies by grinding down [[lapis lazuli]]. He was a prolific artist and very meticulous in his preparation: hundreds of sketches and studies were produced on the spot, assembling different elements like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Such was his dexterity that many artists called upon him to enrich their works with some of his animals and figures. Between 1841 and 1842, he visited Italy, Switzerland, and Scotland. His inspiration remained the same and his technique unaltered, but his notebooks were now filled with sketches of different landscapes.
[[File:Eugène Verboeckhoven - Still-Life with a Hare - WGA24563.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Still-life with Hare (1844)]]
The beauty that emanates from his paintings occasionally hides Verboeckhoven's fundamental talent for drawing. Attention should first be drawn to his preparatory works: his sketches, lithographs, and engravings. His portraits, historical subjects, and sculptures also merit attention.

===Other activities===
A man of his time, he played an important role in the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and was appointed Director General of the Brussels Museums of Fine Arts by the temporary government. Until the end of his life, he was a member of the Committee of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts and when King Leopold I created the category of Fine Arts at the Academy in 1848, he was on the advisory board. Verboeckhoven was also involved in local politics. From 1861 to 1867, he was the Deputy Mayor for the Schaerbeek Council, Brussels.

Like many of his colleagues, Verboeckhoven was a freemason. He joined the Brussels Lodge in 1834 with his brother [[Charles-Louis Verboeckhoven|Charles-Louis]], a well-known [[marine painter]], and his initiation took place on 25 February 1834. Shortly after joining, he suggested founding a Freemason museum. He was very attached to his philosophical convictions and from 1834 onwards and systematically after 1850 added the triangle of three Masonic points to his signature. Eugène Verboeckhoven died in Schaerbeek, Brussels, in 1881. His works are held in museums worldwide.

'''Fourteen Words''', '''14''', or '''14/88''', is a reference to the fourteen-word slogan “'''We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children''',”&lt;ref name="ADL14"/&gt; or less commonly "Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Mattias| last = Gardell| title = Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism| page = 69}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The slogans were originally coined by [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]],&lt;ref name="Michael2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michael|first=George|year=2009|title=David Lane and the Fourteen Words|journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions|volume=10|issue=1|pages=43–61|doi=10.1080/14690760903067986|issn=1469-0764}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founding member of the [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern American Extremism and Domestic Terrorism: An Encyclopedia of Extremists and Extremist Groups|last=Balleck|first=Barry|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2018|isbn=978-1440852749|location=[[United States]]|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms were coined while he was serving a 190-year sentence in [[federal prison]] for his role in violating the civil rights of [[Jews|Jewish]] talk show host [[Alan Berg]], who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984.&lt;ref name="Thompson-20-10-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/white-hate-group-campaign-of-menace-rise-above-movement|title=Racist, Violent, Unpunished: A White Hate Group's Campaign of Menace|last1=Thompson|first1=A.C.|date=19 October 2017|publisher=propublica.org|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogans were publicized through now-defunct [[Wotansvolk|14 Word Press]], founded in 1995 by Lane's wife to disseminate her husband's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-lane|title=David Lane|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="splc profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=David Lane |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-lane |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane also used the phrasing in other pamphlets including the "14 points" of his [[White genocide conspiracy theory|White Genocide Manifesto]] and further in his [[88 Precepts]] essay, stressing his support for racial and [[ethnic religion]]s, opposition to [[Multiracialism|universalism]], his opposition to [[miscegenation]], his [[anti-Americanism]],&lt;ref name="splc profile"/&gt; and support for [[racial segregation|racial separatism]].&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Werwolf!: The History of the National Socialist Guerrilla Movement, 1944–1946|last=Biddiscombe|first=Perry|publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1998|isbn=978-0-8020-0862-6 |at=note 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-truth-about-88-new-book-reveals-secret-meaning-of-neo-nazi-codes-a-770820.html|title=The Truth about 88: New Book Reveals Secret Meaning of Neo-Nazi Codes|date=June 27, 2011|work=[[Spiegel Online]]|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], the Fourteen Words slogan is derived from a passage in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s autobiographical book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', &lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-freedom-party |title=The American Freedom Party (formerly American Third Position) is a political party initially established by racist Southern California skinheads that aims to deport immigrants and return the United States to white rule. |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the rise of the [[Alt-Right]], the Fourteen Words have become a popular Alt-Right meme&lt;ref name="knowyourmeme"&gt;{{cite web|title=14 Words, Know Your Meme|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/14-words |publisher=Know Your Meme|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Phrasing ==
The terms were later adopted by [[white supremacist]]s&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt; and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazis]],&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt; [[white nationalist]]s and [[identitarians]], members of the [[far-right]] and [[alt-right]], the most widely used variation being:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.&lt;ref name="Ph.D.Blanco2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunbar|first1=Edward|last2=Blanco|first2=Amalio|last3=Crèvecoeur-MacPhail &lt;!--Google and Amazon bollix the correct e-grave --&gt;|first3=Desirée A.|title=The Psychology of Hate Crimes as Domestic Terrorism: U.S. and Global Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GZoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 |date=2016-11-21 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781440839078 |pages=91– |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL14"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate on Display: 14 words|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/14-words.html |publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarmichaelMaguire2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carmichael|first1=Cathie|last2=Maguire|first2=Richard C.|title=The Routledge History of Genocide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rvlCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 |date=2015-05-01 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317514848 |pages=211– |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;
Another less commonly used variation is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Mattias| last = Gardell| title = Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism| page = 69}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is sometimes combined with [[88 (number)#In white nationalism|88]], as in "14/88" or "1488" with the 8s representing the eighth letter of the alphabet (H), with "HH" standing for "[[Heil Hitler]]",&lt;ref name="Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/life/2017/01/dictionary-of-white-supermacist-slang-symbols/|title=A Complete Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang and Symbols|last=Ruiz|first=Stephen|date=January 11, 2017|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as a reference to Lane's [[88 Precepts]],&lt;ref name="88 meaning"&gt;{{cite news |author=James Ridgeway |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/28/uselections-obama-racism |title=Fourteen Words that spell racism |date=28 October 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which when combined with "14" refer to Lane's white supremacist [[neo-pagan]] religion, [[Wotansvolk|Wotanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Ruiz |url=https://www.complex.com/life/2017/01/dictionary-of-white-supermacist-slang-symbols/numbers-abbreves-acronyms-one |title=A Complete Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang and Symbols |publisher=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan has been used in acts of white supremacist [[terrorism]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt; It was central to the symbolism of 2008's [[Barack Obama assassination plot in Tennessee|Barack Obama assassination plot]],&lt;ref name="NYT 2009-10-28"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/us/politics/28plot.html|title=Arrests in Plan to Kill Obama and Black Schoolchildren|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|date=October 27, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which intended to kill 88 [[African Americans]], including future President [[Barack Obama]] (at that time the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee), 14 of whom were to be [[Decapitation|beheaded]].&lt;ref name="ABC1027"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Vote2008/story?id=6122962&amp;page=1|title=Feds thwart alleged Obama assassination plot|last=Date|first=Jack|date=2008-10-27|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=2008-10-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030022717/http://www.abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Vote2008/story?id=6122962&amp;page=1|archivedate=30 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haberman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10272008/news/nationalnews/the_plot_to_kill_obama_135558.htm|title=ATF stops plot to kill Barack Obama|last=Haberman|first=Maggie |authorlink=Maggie Haberman|date=2008-10-27|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028183217/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10272008/news/nationalnews/the_plot_to_kill_obama_135558.htm|archivedate=2008-10-28|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinhead [[Curtis Allgier]] notably [[Tattoo|tattooed]] the words on to his body after he [[murder|murdered]] corrections officer Stephen Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2007/08/23/face-hate-curtis-allgier-explained|title=Face of Hate: Curtis Allgier|last=Sanchez|first=Casey|date=August 23, 2007|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dylan Roof]]'s [[race war]]-inspired [[Charleston church shooting]] was influenced by the slogan.

== Origins ==
[[File:Mein Kampf dust jacket.jpeg|thumb|Scholars say the slogan was influenced by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which was also written from prison]]
A strong resemblance of the first definition to a statement in Adolf Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' has been pointed out, albeit not by Lane or by Fourteen Word Press. Scholars such as Barry Balleck have stated that Lane was almost certainly influenced by Hitler, specifically the following statement in ''Mein Kampf''.&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproduction of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the purity of our blood, the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the creator of the universe. Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all knowledge, must serve this purpose. And everything must be examined from this point of view and used or rejected according to its utility. ''(Vol. I, Chapter 8)''&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10306">The '''Frederic W. Goudy Award''' &amp; Lecture were established in 1969 by funds donated to [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) by the [[Mary Flagler Cary]] Charitable Trust in memory of Mrs. Cary's late husband, [[Melbert Cary|Melbert B. Cary, Jr.]], a [[typographer]], type importer, fine printer, book collector, and president of [[AIGA]] (American Institute of Graphic Arts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.rit.edu/cary/exhibitions/rit-frederic-w-goudy-award The RIT Frederic W. Goudy Award: 27 Years of Excellence in Typography]&lt;/ref&gt; The award was named after illustrious American type designer [[Frederic W. Goudy]], a friend and business associate of Mr. Cary.

In the Preface to the book ''Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://ritpress.rit.edu/publications/books/twenty-years-frederic-w-goudy-award.html Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://albert.rit.edu/record=b1237423 Twenty Years of the Frederic W. Goudy Award]&lt;/ref&gt; (Press of the Good Mountain, RIT 1988), Alexander Lawson, RIT Cary Professor emeritus and 1979 recipient of the Goudy Award, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Cary Trustees also funded an annual Frederic W. Goudy Award to be given to an outstanding practitioner in the field of typography. The person would deliver a Goudy Lecture and meet with students in class and in groups, thus providing an opportunity for informal contact with a distinguished graphic arts figure." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the "Foreword" to the same book, Mark Guldin, then Cary Professor, former chair of the School of Printing and former Dean of the RIT College of Imaging Arts and Sciences, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Down through the years, we have always tried to choose those designers and typophiles for the Award who have that thread of attachment to Frederic W. Goudy, those who have worked with the design of [[typeface]]s and those who have produced designs cradled in the traditional values of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], [[Nicolas Jenson|Jenson]], [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]], [[John Baskerville|Baskerville]], and [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]]. Goudy cherished those traditional values." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Goudy Award and Lecture was given annually from 1969 to 1995. It was discontinued in 1996 when the institute diverted the funding to other purposes. It was revived in 2012, discontinued again, and revived again in 2015. Printing and typography RIT alumni and friends of the Cary Collection hope it shall continue annually.

==Recipients of the Goudy Award==
In the first years of the Goudy Award, some of the honorees had known Fred Goudy personally, thereby establishing a direct link with the eponymous past. Although that generation of typographers has passed on, along with much of the analog typographic technology and industry that Goudy and Cary were familiar with, many of Goudy's typefaces, long admired and cherished by typographic aficionados, live on and remain popular in digital formats, while new typeface designs by several Goudy Award honorees have become widely popular in digital form.

Goudy Award honorees have generally been outstanding practitioners in the field of typography, including some or all of the following professions:

* Professional typographer and/or typographic designer
* Typeface designer or lettering artist
* Creator of designs and printing in the tradition Goudy cherished
* Personal and/or cultural connection to Goudy
* Educator, historian, scholar, and/or author in the fields of typography, printing, or lettering

The work of the Goudy Award honorees reveals another, implicit criterion: they elevated the artistic, scholarly, and ethical level of typography, whether through type design, like [[Hermann Zapf]], [[Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse|Gudrun Zapf-Von Hesse]], [[Adrian Frutiger]], [[Matthew Carter]], and [[Kris Holmes]]; through the art of fine printing, like [[Will Carter (printer)|Will Carter]], Henry Morris, and [[Giovanni Mardersteig]]; through artistic typography and printing in commercial publishing and graphic design, like Roderick Stinehour, [[Bradbury Thompson]], and [[Robert Bringhurst]]; through engagement in the social issues and responsibilities of typography, like [[Edna Beilenson]] and Robert (Doc) Leslie, and through typographic education and scholarship, like Alexander Lawson, [[John Dreyfus]], [[Warren Chappell]], and [[Charles Bigelow (type designer)|Charles Bigelow]].

Goudy Award honorees have been among the most honored and admired figures in the typographic arts. Two have received [[MacArthur Prize Fellowship|MacArthur Prize Fellowships]] (Bigelow, Carter). Four have received the [[AIGA medal|AIGA Medal]] (Mardersteig, Leslie, Thompson, Carter).  Four have received the Mainz Gutenberg Award (Mardersteig, Zapf, Frutiger, Dreyfus). Nine have received the Type Directors Club Medal (Zapf, Middleton, Leslie, Thompson, Frutiger, Craw, Benguiat, Carter, Lange). Others have received numerous honors and awards in England, Europe, and America.

In 1979 [[Frank Shifreen]], a recent art graduate of [[Pratt Institute]], began hosting open-studio party art shows at his [[Brooklyn, New York]] studio apartment. There a variety of local New York artists began to network.&lt;ref name="gowanus"/&gt; His building, which was a nineteenth-century [[munitions]] factory at 230 3rd Street&lt;ref name="onceupontime"&gt;{{cite news

The building was right next to the extremely polluted [[Gowanus Canal]], was also just two blocks from a five-acre abandoned dump that had been classified as a city-owned "[[Urban open space|Public Site]]". At Smith Street and 5th Street, it was filled with weeds, trash middens, and expired auto bodies.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt;

==''The Monumental Show'' (1981)==
Shifreen teamed up with artists Michael Keene and George Moore to plan an art exhibition using both the empty space in the munitions factory and the public space next door. They enlisted help from the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation and Carroll Gardens Association,&lt;ref name="onceupontime"/&gt; also receiving a $1500 grant from the Brooklyn Council on the Arts.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt;

Calling themselves the Gowanus Canal Memorial Artyard, they began wheatposting posters throughout the city six months before the show, calling it ''The Monumental Show''. The black-and-white posters were a call for entries, and they received thousands of proposals for live rock music performance and art installations. The organizers selected 150 artists who were each given a 20 by 20 foot space to create their art. The theme of the exhibition was [[monumental sculpture|monumental art]], which consisted of paintings, sculptures, mixed media, and anything one-and-a-half times normal size.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt; The participants included new talent, as well as established artists such as [[Carl Andre]] and [[Andy Warhol]]-sponsored [[Keith Haring]].&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

The show opened on May 16, 1981, and more than 4000 people visited just that first weekend to see the art and hear live music.&lt;ref name="gowanus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; As a result of the show, Shifreen's landlord had him arrested for allegedly stealing electricity, and the ensuing controversy increased the press the show was already receiving. On June 8, 1981, ''[[New York Magazine]]'' did an article on the show entitled "Gowanus Guerrillas", calling it "the event of the season."&lt;ref name="gowanus"/&gt; On June 15, 1981, the show made the cover of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="frankling"&gt;{{cite news

===Controversy===
One artist, the young Laura Foreman, contributed an installation she called "Roomwork" to the interior of the munitions factory. However, Shifreen's landlord, the police, and then reportedly violent local members of the [[Jewish Defense League]] took offense to her exhibit's inclusion of a painting of [[Hitler]]. A few days after the opening, members of the Jewish Defense League entered the exhibit and slashed another painting by [[Komar and Melamid]], the show closing down soon after.&lt;ref name="hankonealphoto"&gt;{{cite news

==''The Monument Redefined'' (1982)==
[[File:MonumentRedefined.jpg|thumb|220px|Poster seen around New York]]
After the success of the first, Shifreen and artist Scott Siken began organizing a second show.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt; Entitled ''The Monument Redefined'', the 1982 show was held in three locations. The outdoor site covered twelve acres with artwork visible from the window of Brooklyn's [[F (New York City Subway service)|F subway]].&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rhizome"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rhizome.org/profile.php?1057286|title=Frank Shifreen|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Rhizome|accessdate=2010-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220082003/http://rhizome.org/profile.php?1057286|archivedate=2010-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space for the two indoor sites was donated by the Downtown Brooklyn Cultural Center, while sponsors included the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Department of Parks and Recreation]], the Decentralization Program of the [[New York State Council on the Arts]],&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt; The City of New York, [[Con Edison]], the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]], and the Organization of Independent Artists.&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt;

The stated theme of the exhibition was not size, but social responsibility.&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt; The call-for-entries was again a poster, but also free ads from ''[[Artforum]]'', ''Arts'', and ''[[Artnews]]'', and thousands of artists submitted entrees. The co-curators selected 400 proposals, including works by well-known artists such as [[Carl Andre]], [[Christo]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Nancy Holt]], the controversial [[Chris Burden]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Boaz Vaadia]],&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt; TODT,&lt;ref name="fleischer"&gt;{{cite news

===Reception===
As before, the show was a success, with multiple art publications publishing reviews. Three panel discussions were held at [[Cooper Union]], and artists as well as art critics took part.&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt; On October 3, 1982, there was a review in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt;

==''Gowanus Canal Redefined'' (1982)==

''The Monument Redefined'' was welcomed by much of the local [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]] community.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt; Buddy Scotto and James Albano of the Gowanus Community Development Program contacted the Gowanus Memorial Artyard to offer a sponsorship for an architectural competition.&lt;ref name="onceupontime"/&gt; Called ''The Gowanus Canal Redefined'', it was one of the only grassroots contests of its kind.&lt;ref name="onceupontime"/&gt; Frank Shifreen and Scott Siken of the Gowanus Memorial Artyard organized and curated the event, selecting proposals for "critical reinterpretations" of the [[Gowanus Canal]]. A $1000 prize was to be awarded to the best architectural proposal for revitalizing the Gowanus Canal area.&lt;ref name="galleryview"/&gt; The area, a former industrial zone, was suffering from extreme neglect in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="storefront"&gt;{{cite news

The show ran from October 18, 1982 to October 29, 1982 and included participants Todd Ayoung, Dennis Joyce, Stephen Korns, Joe Lewis, Brian McMahon, and Kristin Steen.&lt;ref name="storefront"/&gt;

==Historical significance==
The show was one of several mega-shows in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="collaborativeprojects"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show, the public ''Times Square Show'' exhibition had nightly art performances every night for months, and in the two years after that there were several large-scale exhibitions in disused buildings in public locations. One was ''Ninth Street Survival'' at an abandoned school on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], as well as the ''Coney Island Show''&lt;ref name="collaborativeprojects"/&gt; on a pier at the [[Coney Island]] Amusement Park.&lt;ref name="abcnorio"/&gt; Several New York artists, including Shifreen and Julius Vitali, have theorized that the [[East Village, Manhattan]] art movement in the 1980s may have resulted partly from the artist-organized and not-for-profit shows of the early 1980s, including ''The Monumental Show'' and ''Monument Redefined''. The shows made it possible for [[art galleries]] and [[art dealers]] to find and support emerging artists.&lt;ref name="digitalmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

A number of occupations are classified under the broad term of ''[[graphic designer]]''. Graphic design career paths cover all ends of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]]. Many of these job descriptions overlap heavily.

==Graphic Art Managers==
The following are positions or responsibilities and usually titles, held by experienced graphic designers in related management roles:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Creative Director===
A [[creative director|Creative Director's]] range of experience can be broad and encompass a number of disciplines; visual design; copywriting, art direction, advertising account director, film/video director. A Creative Directors job is to initiate the creative concept of a project and drive the direction of the project. The role of a Creative Director is to formulate creative concepts, whether it is an advertising campaign, brand identity, TV commercial, marketing campaign. A Creative Director was often referred to the 'Ideas Guy' and works with a team of 'creatives' - art director, graphic designer, copywriter, film director to produce the concept and final production.

===Art Director===
[[Art director]]s make sure that illustrators and production artists produce and complete their work on time and to the creative director or client's satisfaction. Art directors also play a major role in the development of a project by making decisions on the visual elements of the project, and by giving the final say on the selection of models, art, props, colors, and other elements. Art directors need advanced training in graphic design as they often do artwork and designing themselves. However, an art director's time may be consumed doing supervisory and administrative work.(See link for more information)

===Art Production Manager===
Art production managers or [[Advertising agency#Other departments and personnel|traffic manager]]s oversee the production aspect of art to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Art production managers supervise artists or advise the supervisors of artists. Creative directors and art directors often assume the role of art production managers, especially when production cost is not a critical enough concern to designate a manager for the specific role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Hands-on Graphic Designer==
The following are positions or responsibilities, not necessarily titles, held by art directors and graphic designers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Brand identity Developer===
[[Brand identity]] design is concerned with the visual aspects of a company or organization's brand or identity. A brand identity design is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen; it is the company's visual identity, and is how a company illustrates its ‘image.’ A company's brand identity can be represented in terms of design through a unique [[logo]], or [[signage]], and is then often integrated throughout all the elements of a company's materials such as business cards, stationery, packaging, media advertising, promotions, and more. Brand identity may include logo design. Brand identity development is usually a collaborative effort between creative directors, art directors, copywriters, account managers and the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Broadcast Designers====
A [[broadcast designer]] is a person involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by [[character generator]] (CG) operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in [[digital media]] (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.

====Logo Designer====
The job of a [[logo design]]er is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key points of a company through an image. Logo designers take the information given to them by the client and work, using their own creativity along with marketing strategy to find an appropriate image that their client can use to represent what they are trying to encourage, sell, or what they are. It is not likely that a company will specialize in logo design or have a position for a designated logo designer. Art directors and graphic designers usually perform logo designs.

=== Illustrator ===
[[Illustrator]]s conceptualize and create [[illustrations]] that represent an idea or a story through two-dimensional or three-dimensional images. Illustrators may do drawings for printed materials such as books, magazines, and other publications, or for commercial products such as textiles, packaging, wrapping paper, greeting cards, calendars, stationery, and more.

Illustrators use many different media, from pencil and paint to digital formatting, to prepare and create their illustrations. An illustrator consults with clients in order to determine what illustrations will best meet the story they are trying to tell, or what message they are trying to communicate.

Illustrating may be a secondary skill requirement of graphic design or a specialty skill of a freelance artist, usually known for a unique style of illustrating. Illustration may be published separately as in [[fine art]]. However, illustrations are usually inserted into [[page layout]]s for [[communication design]] in the context of graphic design professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Image Developer====
Similar to illustration are other methods of [[image development (visual arts)|developing images]] such as [[photography]], [[3D modeling]], and [[image editing]]. Creative professionals in these positions are not usually called illustrators, but are utilized the same way. Photographers are likely to freelance. 3D modelers are likely to be employed for long-term projects. Image editing is usually a secondary skill to either of the above, but may also be a specialty to aid web development, software development, or multimedia development in a job title known as multimedia specialist. Although these skills may require technical knowledge, graphic design skills may be applied as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Multimedia Developer====
Multimedia developers may come from a graphic design or illustration background and apply those talents to motion, sound, or interactivity. [[Motion graphic design|Motion designers]] are graphic designers for motion. [[Animator]]s are illustrators for motion. [[Videographer]]s are photographers for motion. Multimedia developers may also image edit, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound edit]], program, or compose [[multimedia]] just as multimedia specialists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Content Developer====
[[Content (media)|Content]] developer is a generic term used for describing illustrators, visual image developers, and multimedia developers in software and web development. The term has a broader scope that includes non-graphical content as well. A generic name for content that is used in a digital composition are [[digital asset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Journalist====
[[Visual Journalist]]s, also known as Infographic Artists create [[information graphics]] or Infographics; visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics are used anywhere where information needs to be explained quickly or simply, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information. They are applied in all aspects of scientific visualization.

===Layout artist===
A [[page layout|layout artist]] deals with the structure and layout of images and text in a pleasing format. This can include magazine work, [[brochure]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s, [[book]]s, [[CD]] booklets, [[poster]]s, and similar formats. For magazines and similar productions, [[color]], [[typeface]], text formatting, graphic layout and more must be considered. Is the chosen typeface good for long term reading, or will the eyes get tired? Does that title typeface fit the feel of the rest of the article? Are the photos arranged in such a way that is pleasing to the eye, and directs the reader in the right flow or direction? These are just some of the questions that layout artists must ask themselves. Page layouts are usually done by art directors, graphic designers, production artists or a combination of those positions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Entry level job|Entry level]] layout work is often known as [[paste up]] art. Entry level layout graphic designers are often known as [[production artist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In an [[Advertising agencies#In-house advertising agencies|in-house art department]], layout artists are sometimes known as [[DTP artist]]s or DTP associates.

====Interface Designer====
[[Interface design]]ers are [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control elements]] are interactive, interface design often overlaps [[interaction design]]. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single [[computer file]]s, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, knowledge of how to automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the [[job title]] of web designer in a [[web development]] company.

====Web Designer====
A [[web design]]er's work could be viewed by thousands of people every day. Web designers create the pages, layout, and graphics for web pages, and play a key role in the development of a website. Web designers have the task of creating the look and feel of a website by choosing the style, and by designing attractive graphics, images, and other visual elements, and adapting them for the website's pages. Web designers also design and develop the navigation tools of a site. Web designers  may make decisions regarding what content is included on a web page, where things are placed, and how the aesthetic and continuity is maintained from one screen to the next. All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Depending on the scope of the project, web design may involve collaboration between [[software engineering|software engineers]] and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or handling just the graphics in an [[HTML editor]], while the advance coding is done separately by [[programmers]]. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of web design in positions often known as [[web master]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==== Package Designer ====
A [[package design]]er or packaging technician may utilize technical skills aside from graphic design. Knowledge of cuts, crease, folding, nature and behavior of the packaging material such as paper, corrugated sheet, synthetic or other type of materials may also be required. A customer may see the top/outside of a package at first, but may also be drawn to other package design features. A packaging design may require [[Three-dimensional space]] layout skills in addition to visual communication to consider how well a design works at multiple angles. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software applications specifically for packaging design may be utilized

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The '''Gypsy Robe''' is a tradition in which a chorus member with the most Broadway credits receives a robe on the opening night of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]]. The title of the robe was changed to the '''Legacy Robe''' in July 2018.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/07/13/actors-equitys-new-name-for-the-gypsy-robe-the-legacy-robe/ "Actors’ Equity’s New Name for the Gypsy Robe: The ‘Legacy Robe’"] ''American Theatre'', July 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ritual ==
Before curtain on the opening night of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]], actors, stage managers, crew, and everyone associated with the play gather onstage for the Gypsy Robe ceremony. At the center of the stage will be a representative of [[Actors' Equity Association]] and a recently honored gypsy. The honored gypsy wears the robe that's decorated with mementos and drawings from past shows. The Equity representative tells the history of the ritual and announces the newest recipient from the company. The new recipient puts on the robe, and circles the stage counter-clockwise three times as everyone touches the robe for good luck. The Gypsy Robe recipient then makes their way throughout the theatre to continue bringing good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org/aboutequity/gypsyrobe/gypsyrobehome.asp "Gypsy Robe"] actorsequity.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules of the Ritual==
According to [[Actors' Equity Association]], the following are the rules of the Gypsy Robe:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org/aboutequity/gypsyrobe/gypsyrules.asp "Gypsy Rules"] actorsequity.org&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Gypsy Robe goes only to Broadway musicals with a chorus.
# Robe goes to a chorus member only, with the most number of Broadway chorus credits.
# It must be delivered by 1/2 hour on opening night to the member selected.
# New recipient must put on Robe and circle the stage 3 times, while cast members reach out and touch Robe for good luck; new recipient visits each dressing room while wearing the Robe.
# New recipient supervises the addition of an application from that show to the Robe. Important rules for adding mementos: For wearability, durability, and longevity, add-ons must be lightweight, sturdy, and reasonably sized so each Robe can represent a full season.
# Opening night date and the recipient's name are written on or near the memento and cast members are to sign only that section of Robe.
# Recipient will attend the next Broadway musical opening and will present the Robe to the next "Gypsy" in that show.

== History ==
The ritual dates to 1950, when Florence Baum, a chorus member in [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'']], entered the men's dressing room wearing a robe, pale pink with white feathers.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/theater/bill-bradley-73-created-the-gypsy-robe.html "Gypsy Robe"] ''The New York Times'', February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/CBS-SUNDAY-MORNING-to-Feature-Segment-on-Broadway-Gypsy-Robe-610-20120609 "CBS Sunday Morning features segment on Broadway Gypsy Robe"] Broadway World.com&lt;/ref&gt; The men took turns trying it on. Fellow chorus member, Bill Bradley, sent a dressing gown from one of his fellow performers to his friend performing in ''[[Call Me Madam]]''.  A feathered rose from [[Ethel Merman|Ethel Merman's]] costume was attached to the robe, and it was then given to a chorus member in ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The robe continued to be passed from one show to another, each time with a memento added on.

The ritual has become more formal, with rules about how it is presented, worn, and displayed.  When robes are full of artifacts, a new robe is started.  Retired robes are kept at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]], at the [[Smithsonian]], and at [[Actors' Equity]].

In 2005, Brynn Williams from the Broadway cast of ''In My Life'' became the youngest recipient of the Gypsy Robe at age 12.

On April 18, 2018, Actors Equity announced that the name of robe would be changed at the end of the current theater season. A poll was opened to union members to vote on a new name.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Ryan.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for symbol is ''ot'', which, in early Judaism, denoted not only a sign, but also a visible religious token of the relation between [[God]] and man.

|[[Star of David]]
|[[File:Star of David.svg|100px]]
|The Star of David, a symbol of Judaism, as a [[religion]], and of the Jewish people as a whole. And it also thought to be the shield (or at least the emblem on it) of King David.

Jewish lore links the symbol to the "[[Seal of Solomon]]", the magical signet ring used by [[King Solomon]] to control demons and spirits. Jewish lore also links the symbol to a magic shield owned by King David that protected him from enemies. Following [[Jewish emancipation]] after the [[French revolution]], Jewish communities chose the Star of David as their symbol. The star is found on the [[Flag of Israel]].

==Shabbat and circumcision==
{{Judaism}}
The Shabbat, according to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."  The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use.  The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".

==The Tabernacle and the sacrifices==

{{Main|Tabernacle (Judaism)|Korban}}

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], while the [[Israelites]] were living in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] for forty years, they built a Tabernacle ({{lang-he|משכן}} [[transliteration|translit]]: ''mishkan'', "Place of [Divine] dwelling"); this was viewed as the abode of the Shekhinah (the presence of YHWH) on Earth, and the place where the priests could minister to God on behalf of the nation of Israel.

==The priests==
The Hebrew for priest is ''Kohen''; the ''Kohanim'' (plural) mediated between God and man by offering sacrifices, and by other services in the Temple. The leader of them the ''Kohen Gadol'', the high priest.

The vestments of the high priest were interpreted in three ways. The explanation of Philo is as follows ("Vita Mosis," iii. 209): His upper garment was the symbol of the ether, while the blossoms represented the earth, the [[pomegranate]]s typified running water, and the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s denoted the music of the water. The [[ephod]] corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the [[zodiac]], which were denoted also by the twelve names on [[Priestly breastplate|the breastplate]]. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.

[[Josephus]]' explanation is this:&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." iii. 7, § 7&lt;/ref&gt; The coat was the symbol of the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The [[ephod]] typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the [[girdle]] symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.

The [[Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Menachot vii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midrash]] ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (x.) give the following interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or for the sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The miter denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.

==The symbolic values of numbers==
{{See also|Significance of numbers of Judaism|Hebrew numerology}}

The number [[3 (number)|three]] was the symbol of holiness and love. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten times three [[ell]]s in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections,&lt;ref&gt;Num. vi. 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; and in the invocation of God the word "holy" was repeated thrice.

The symbolism of the number [[4 (number)|four]] was based on the contemplation of the quaternity as found in the universe, which included both heaven and earth&lt;ref&gt;comp. Job xxxvii. I Copied from wikipedia3; Isa. xi. 12; Ezek. vii. 2; I Chron. ix. 24; Dan. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number four connoted [[heaven]] as the throne of God.

The Holy of Holies was in the form of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], and the Holy Place was a double cube in length. All the vessels of the Temple in Jerusalem (except the candlestick) were rectangular. According to Ezekiel i. 26-28, the number four symbolized the divine revelation, while in the view of Philo it was the number of complete harmony.&lt;ref&gt;"De Opificio Mundi," pp.&amp;nbsp;13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The number [[5 (number)|five]] typified semicompletion. The dimensions of the curtain of the Holy of Holies were four ells by five; the altar in the court covered a surface of five square ells; and there were five pillars at the entrance to the Tabernacle.

The number [[6 (number)|six]] symbolizes imperfection.

The number [[7 (number)|seven]] was the general symbol for all association with God, and was the favorite religious number of Judaism, typifying the covenant of holiness and sanctification, and also all that was holy and sanctifying in purpose. The candlestick had seven lamps, and the acts of atonement and purification were accompanied by a sevenfold sprinkling. The establishment of the Sabbath, the [[shmita|Sabbatical year]], and the year of jubilee was based on the number seven, as were the periods of purification and of mourning.
The number 7 is the Divine number of completion.

The number [[8 (number)|eight]] symbolizes new beginnings. According to [[Kaballah]] in the [[Zohar]] the number eight signifies this because the eighth day was the first day after creation when God returned to work; the week began again.

The number [[10 (number)|ten]] symbolized absolute completeness. The court to the Tabernacle was ten times ten ells long, and five times ten ells wide, and in the Holy of Holies the [[Ten Commandments]] were preserved.

The number [[12 (number)|twelve]], being the product of three and four, typified the union of the people with God.&lt;ref name="Maude-1862"&gt;[[#MAUDE 1862|Maude 1862]]: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8oMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;pg=PA509#v=onepage&amp;q=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;f=false 509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:31-38|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:24-30|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the table were twelve loaves of show-bread, and the breastplate of the priest contained twelve precious stones as emblems of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]], which camped round about the Sanctuary.

The number [[13 (number)|thirteen]] symbolizes the principles of faith and God's mercy.

The number [[18 (number)|eighteen]] is considered significant because the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "life" is חי (''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]''), which has a [[gematria|numerical value]] of 18.

The number [[26 (number)|twenty six]] symbolizes God's name.

==Metals and minerals==
[[Gold]] was the symbol of the divine or celestial light, the glory of God.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. vi. 11; Dan. xi. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver]] was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. i. 22; Jer. vi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brass]] symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xxvi. 19; Jer. xv. 12; Job xl. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt]] was declared to be necessary in every meal-offering, in which it takes the place of the blood in the animal sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. ii. 13; but comp. Ezek. xliii. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud salt symbolizes the [[Torah]], for as the world cannot exist without salt, so it can not endure without the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Soferim xv. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==

The Israelites used an [[indigo]]-colored dye called ''tekhelet''; this dye was likely made from snail ''[[murex trunculus]]''. This dye was very important in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as [[Tyrian purple]].

In the Torah the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their [[tallit]] (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they look at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) [[Blue in Judaism]] has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.

"Argaman" was the symbol of power, and of glory,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 6; Judges viii. 26&lt;/ref&gt; so that [[Alexander Balas]] robed Jonathan in purple,&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20&lt;/ref&gt; which was especially used to designate royal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20, xi. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tola'at" and "shani" ("[[scarlet (color)|scarlet]]," "[[crimson]]") symbolized blood, and thus frequently typified life, although this color often designated sin, as well as joy and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. xxxviii. 28; Josh. ii. 18, 21; Jer. iv. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Purification from sin was also symbolized by purple.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xvi. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shesh" ([[white]]) was the symbol of physical and intellectual purity, being the true color of light, without any modification.&lt;ref&gt;Cant. v. 10; Dan. iv. 10, 14, 20; Zech. xiv. 5&lt;/ref&gt; White also symbolizes death.  In some cases, it can also symbolize life.

Yellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see [[Yellow badge]]).

==Festivals and holy days==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects shown on a gold goblet (2nd century CE) excavated in Rome]]
The Torah delineates three [[pilgrimage]] festivals, [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] (The Feasts of Weeks) and [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles). Each of these was tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.

[[Passover]] celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people.

The eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the [[The Exodus#Bondage in Egypt|Egyptian bondage]]. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 37c; Midrash Gen. Rabbah lxxx&lt;/ref&gt; People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from [[slavery]].

A discussion of the meaning of [[Shavuot]] (the Feast of Weeks) and of [[Sukkot]], the Feast of [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacles]], is found in the entries on those subjects.

A discussion of symbolism inherent in [[Rosh Hashanah]] (The New Year) and [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement) is found in the entries on those subjects. The Day of Atonement was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.

==Symbolic visions of the Prophets==
[[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] beheld an [[almond]]-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God.

[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Amos viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam's mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead.&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xxii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;II Kings xiii. 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. xx. 2&lt;/ref&gt; while Jeremiah wore a [[yoke]] upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;Jer. xxvii. 2-4, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezekiel]] was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ezek. xxxvii. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]

==On tombstones==
Some common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'') who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the [[Levite]]s as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before he pronounced the blessing.

Some gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of [[grape]]s as an emblem of Israel.

The [[Star of David]] (''Magen David'') occurs frequently.

Sometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.

==Influence on Christian symbols==
The influence of Judaism upon [[Christian symbolism]] as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., is apparent both in painting and in sculpture, the most frequent motives being those that occur in the [[Mishnah]] as formulas for prayer on fast-days. The prayer beginning with the words "Mi she-'anah," which was included in the [[selihah]] at an early date, was adopted in the Christian ritual as the litany "Libera domine." This litany was figuratively used in a certain sequence as a symbol, for the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] was regarded as a symbol of the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], since the early religions, and the act of sacrifice emblemized the death on the cross.

Abraham was represented as the symbol of the power of faith and Isaac as the sacrificed redeemer. The ascension of [[Elijah]] was believed to typify the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]], who was regarded by Christian symbolism as an analogue to Elijah, although this ascension was also taken as a type of the general [[resurrection]] from the dead. Job sitting among the ashes was the symbol of patience and of the power of resistance of the flesh; and [[Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael|Hananiah]], [[Meshach|Mishael]], and [[Abednego|Azariah]] in the fiery furnace typified steadfastness in persecution and faith in the aid of God. Christian [[sarcophagi]] contained artistic representations of the fall of man, [[Noah]] and the ark, scenes from the life of [[Moses]] in three variations, [[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

==The land of Zion==
{{Main|Land of Israel}}

[[Zion]] is a Biblical term that refers to [[Jerusalem]], and is the source for the modern term [[Zionism]].

'''John Carl Schoenherr''' (July 5, 1935 – April 8, 2010)&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; was an American [[illustrator]]. He won the 1988 [[Caldecott Medal]] for U.S. children's book illustration, recognizing ''Owl Moon'' by [[Jane Yolen]], a father-and-daughter story where only Schoenherr's drawings reveal the child's gender.&lt;!-- source is our book article --&gt; He was posthumously inducted by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=sfhof2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=sffhof/&gt;

==Life==

Schoenherr was born in New York City (Manhattan) and raised in [[Queens]], "in a German-speaking household in a polyglot community", where he used drawings to communicate with speakers of other languages.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; He graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embracingthechild.org/aschoenherr.html |title=Biography – John Schoenherr |website=EmbracingtheChild.org |accessdate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied art at the [[Art Students League of New York]] with [[Will Barnet]] and at [[Pratt Institute]].

Schoenherr was a resident of [[Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adelson |first=Fred B. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E1D9153BF93AA35752C0A9669C8B63 |title=ART; Children's Page Turners to Linger Over |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 9, 2000 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |quote=&lt;br&gt;Both Richard Egielski of Milford and John Schoenherr of Delaware Township (near Stockton) are represented by illustrations from books aimed at ages 4 to 8, the youngest group.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on April 8, 2010, of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

==Career==

Schoenherr may be known best as the original illustrator of the dust jacket art of  ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'',&lt;ref name="Omni reboot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://omnireboot.com/2013/dune/ |title=''Dune'': The Most Important Science Fiction Art Ever |work=[[Omni Reboot]] |first=Jeff |last=Love |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1965 science fiction novel by [[Frank Herbert]] that inaugurated a book series and [[Dune (franchise)|media franchise]].&lt;ref name=isfdb-dune/&gt; He had previously illustrated the serializations of the novel in ''[[Analog (magazine)|Analog]]'', an endeavor which secured him a 1965 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Professional Artist.&lt;ref name="Omni reboot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo 1965"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1965-hugo-awards/ |title=1965 Hugo Awards |publisher=The Hugo Awards (thehugoawards.org) |accessdate=2014-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVV9vAxG?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1965-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later did the art for the ''Analog'' serialization of Herbert's ''[[Children of Dune]]''.&lt;ref name="Omni reboot"/&gt; In 1978 [[Berkley Books]] published ''[[The Illustrated Dune]]'', an edition of ''Dune'' with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by Schoenherr.&lt;ref name="Omni reboot"/&gt;&lt;ref name=isfdb-dune/&gt; Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], [[Baron Harkonnen]] and the [[Sardaukar]].&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Herbert|first=Frank|url=http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html |title=''Dune'' Genesis|accessdate=2014-10-31 |publisher=Reprinted with permission at FrankHerbert.org |work=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]] |date=July 1980 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107220342/http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html |archivedate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoenherr was also very well known as a wildlife artist and children's book illustrator, with over forty books to his credit. Most of his black-and-white illustration work used the [[scratchboard]] technique, and he was long known as the only [[commercial artist]] who specialized in it. His paintings were often [[egg tempera]], another unusual medium. Schoenherr also completed paintings for [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeVore |first=Howard |authorlink=Howard DeVore |title=A History of the Hugo, Nebula and International Fantasy Awards 1951–1986 |location=Dearborn, Michigan |publisher=The Misfit Press |year=1987 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Miller (artist and author) |title=Space Art: A Starlog Photo Guidebook |location=New York |publisher=Starlog Press |year=1976 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DiFate |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent DiFate |title=DiFate's Catalog of Science Fiction Hardware |location=New York |publisher=Workman Publishers |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schoenherr's knowledge of [[zoology]] was very useful in creating alien creatures. He was a member of the [[American Society of Mammalogists]], the [[Society of Animal Artists]], and the [[Society of Illustrators]].

Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DiFate |first=Vincent |chapter=Science Fiction Art: Some Contemporary Science Fiction Illustrators |title=The Science Fiction Reference Book |editor-first=Marshall B |editor-last=Tymn |location=San Bernardino |publisher=The Borgo Press |year=1981 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the books he illustrated are ''The Wolfling'' and ''[[Rascal (book)|Rascal]]'' by [[Sterling North]], the latter a [[Newbery Honor Book]].

'''''Killing a Deer''''' or '''''A Deer Hunt - The Kill''''' (''L'Hallali du cerf'' in French), is a very large picture (355 by 505&amp;nbsp;cm), representing a hunting scene, painted in 1867 by [[Gustave Courbet]]. The picture is currently on display in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] of [[Paris]].

== History ==
The painting was done during the winter of 1866-1867. It is in the large format newly adopted by Courbet, as also in ''[[A Burial at Ornans]]'' and ''[[The Artist's Studio]]''. The work was exhibited at the [[French art salons and academies]] of 1869. The picture caused some scandal, major formats being previously reserved for noble [[history painting]]s rather than hunting scenes.

== Iconography ==
The scene shows a deer attacked by a pack of hunting dogs and collapsed on the snowy ground. Two characters are on the right. The drill is Cusenier Jules, a resident of [[Ornans]] while the man on horseback is Felix Gaudy, of [[Vuillafans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinette|first1=Matthieu|last2=Soulier-François|first2=Françoise|title=From Belini to Bonnard: Great Masterpieces|location=Besançon|year=1992|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Hallali'' is in the tradition of representation of the scene [[Hunting|hunt]], from the seventeenth century. Courbet uses a harsh realistic representation closer to Flemish models. Hunting scenes are common in the paintings of Courbet; every step of the chase is represented

== Influences ==
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] in [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]].]]
There is another influence in this painting, that of ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) by [[Eugène Delacroix]] ''(illustrated)''. His influence is reflected particularly through the mounted character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Margaret|title=Courbet's Hunt Scenes: The End of a Tradition|location=Providence, Rhode Island|year=1990|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It measures 153.5 cm in height, 58.7 cm in width, dates from the 12th to 13th centuries, and depicts a solitary [[nimbate]] figure on a dark-brown medieval Chinese silk.

== Description ==
[[File:Manichaean Painting of the Buddha Jesus (detail).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Detail: Cross of Light.]]
The painting depicts a monumental, solitary figure, with glittering lines of gold and various colours. The upper half is occupied by a cloaked deity seated in [[lotus position]] and hands held close to one another in front of the chest. He is holding in his left hand a red lotus pedestal on where a small gold cross (Cross of Light) is seated. In addition to the [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] around the head, there is a faint outline of a large [[mandorla]] that frames the body and reaches the upwards, where a [[Tassel|tasselled]] [[Chatra (umbrella)|canopy]] hung above the nimbus. The lower half is filled by an elaborate pedestal, which is a multilayered hexagonal stand supporting a lotus with lush sets of petals that open in five orderly rings. Each petal evokes the form of a miniature altar.

== Background ==
According to the ''[[Song Huiyao Jigao]]'', there were six paintings in the possession of a Chinese Manichaean church used as objects of learning and veneration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/publication/jiuzhou/txt/15-2-190.txt |title=摩尼教華名辨異 |last=Lin |first=Wushu |website=cciv.cityu.edu.hk |language=zh-Hant |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of this hanging scroll represents a unique case of religious metamorphosis, for it has been used by three religions. It can be divided into three episodes: before ca. 1552, the image was venerated by [[Chinese Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] from southern China. From 1552 (or 1608) to 1612, during this period of sixty years (at most), the painting functioned as a [[Kirishitan|Christian]] object in Japan. No written records, only legend at [[Seiunji Temple]], suggests that the painting belonged to an executed Christian [[daimyō]] [[Arima Harunobu]], before it ended up in the Buddhist temple. The most recent, which has lasted approximately four hundred years, when the scroll has been used as a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] work of art in the Seiunji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="AMPBJ" /&gt; The Japanese Buddhists considered it a depiction of [[Ākāśagarbha]] ({{lang-ja|虚空蔵菩薩}}), a celestial [[bodhisattva]] worshipped in [[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/28622189/_A_Song_Dynasty_Manichaean_Painting_of_the_Buddha_Jesus_%E5%B9%85%E5%AE%8B%E4%BB%A3%E6%91%A9%E5%B0%BC%E6%95%99_%E5%A4%B7%E6%95%B0%E4%BD%9B%E5%B8%A7_Yifu_Songdai_Monijiao_Yishufozheng_._Journal_for_the_Study_of_Art_History_%E8%89%BA%E6%9C%AF%E5%8F%B2%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6_Yishushi_Yanjiu_2008_139-189_in_Chinese_ |title=一幅宋代摩尼敎《夷數佛幀》 |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |translator-last=Wang |translator-first=Yuanyuan |date=2008 |website=academia.edu |language=zh-Hant |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
The painting was identified earlier by the Japanese art historian {{ill|Takeo Izumi|ja|泉武夫 (美術史学者)}} as a [[Yuan dynasty]] [[Church of the East in China|Nestorian Christian]] work of art. [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]] notes that the highly [[Sinicization|sinicised]] character of this painting weakens this idea, "since [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christianity]] in China maintained a foreign identity and produced art with relatively small degree of integration compared to the arts of other originally foreign but later fully integrated religions, such as Buddhism and Manichaeism."&lt;ref name="AMPBJ" /&gt;

After studying and comparing the scroll with a number of Buddhist, Nestorian Christian and Manichaean works of art, Gulácsi concluded in her article ''A Manichaean Portrait of the Buddha Jesus: Identifying a Twelfth-Thirteenth-century Chinese Painting from the Collection of Seiun-ji Zen Temple'', that the painting is a Manichaean work of art: {{Quote|text=Despite the fact that it features a figure seated on a lotus pedestal with a cross statuette in his left hand, this painting is neither a Buddhist nor a Christian work of art for three reasons: first, it can be linked with contemporaneous Chinese textual and visual sources that support its creation and used in a Manichaean context; second, it displays iconographic and compositional continuity with earlier Manichaean art; and third, it depicts a Manichaean subject (the prophet Jesus) with symbols that allude to two fundamental Manichaean teachings ([[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]] and the Cross of Light) that are well documented throughout the history of this religion. Based on a contemporaneous inventory of paintings in the possession of a Manichaean temple in [[Wenzhou]], this hanging scroll may be titled {{transl|zh|Yishu fo zhen}} (Silk Painting of the Buddha ["Prophet"] Jesus). Its attribution and identification help us to comfirm that the Jesus subject had a long history in Manichaean devotional art, which now can be seen through two fragments from [[Xinjiang|East Central Asia]] and a third, exquisitely well preserved, from southern China.&lt;ref name="AMPBJ" /&gt;}}

A '''music executive''' or '''record executive''' is a person within a [[record label]] who works in senior management, making executive decisions over the label's artists. Their role varies greatly but in essence, they can oversee one, or many, aspects of a record label, including [[A&amp;R]], [[Recording contract|contract]]s, [[music management|management]], [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing]], [[record producer|production]], [[manufacturing|manufacture]], [[marketing]]/[[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Record distributor|distribution]], [[copyright]], and [[concert tour|touring]]. Although music executives work in senior management, a number of music executives have gone on to establish their own record labels as owners themselves, sometimes being involved in the music industry initially as artists, A&amp;Rs, or producers for a number of years and building a strong reputation.

Music executives work in a variety of settings for "major" record labels such as [[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], or [[Warner Music Group]]. However, many choose to work with, or start their own [[independent record labels]] such as [[Sub Pop]], [[Block Starz Music]], [[Ironworks (record label)|Ironworks]] and [[Jagjaguwar]].

'''''Occupational Hazards: My Time Governing in Iraq''''' or '''''The Prince of the Marshes: And other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq''''' is a 2006 non-fiction book by the British writer and Member of Parliament [[Rory Stewart]].

== Content==
'''''Occupational Hazards''''' documents Stewart's experiences as [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] Deputy Governor of the Iraqi province of [[Maysan]] and Senior Advisor in the province of [[Dhi Qar]]. These provinces in the remote, impoverished marsh regions of [[southern Iraq]] were home to a diverse number of parties and peoples and Stewart spends much of his time mediating, negotiating hostage releases, holding elections, and trying to restore order to a society which seemed on the edge of civil war, following the [[Iraq War]]. Much of the book is concerned with Stewart's dealings with the Prince of the Marshes, a local warlord who had fought against [[Saddam Hussein]] and regarded Stewart's actions with suspicion. '''''Occupational Hazards''''' explores the hostility experienced by Coalition troops and administrators, mostly notably when, in May 2004, Stewart and his compound in [[Nasiriyah]] were besieged by [[Sadrist]] militia, an experience he recounted in his [[Desert Island Discs]] appearance of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008pdqp|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Rory Stewart|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Occupational Hazards''''' received positive reviews following its publication, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]] describing it as "a rueful, richly detailed, often harrowing account...the real value of [which] is Mr. Stewart's sobering picture of the difficulties involved in creating a coherent Iraqi state based on the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/28/books/28book.html|title=An Outsider Confronts the Tide in the Marshes of Iraq|last=Grimes|first=William|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Morphet]], writing in [[The Guardian]], described it as "an extraordinarily vivid tale with many exciting episodes" and Maya Jasanoff called it "an eye-opening and at times enthralling book" in [[London Review of Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/10/highereducation.news2|title=Review: Occupational Hazards by Rory Stewart|last=Morphet|first=David|date=2006-06-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n07/maya-jasanoff/one-enduring-trace-of-our-presence|title=One Enduring Trace of Our Presence|last=Jasanoff|first=Maya|date=2007-04-05|work=London Review of Books|access-date=2018-11-02|pages=11–12|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==
In 2017, the book was adapted for the stage by [[Stephen Brown (playwright)|Stephen Brown]], debuting at [[Hampstead Theatre]] under the title ''Occupational Hazards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2017/occupational-hazards/| title=Occupational Hazards | publisher=Hampstead Theatre | date=2017|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cavendish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavendish|first1=Dominic|title=Fascinating but fleeting encounter with a latter-day T E Lawrence - Occupational Hazards review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/occupational-hazards-hampstead-theatre-review-fascinating-fleeting/|accessdate=29 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Hanoi]], under French colonial rule, a program paying people a bounty for each rat tail handed in was intended to exterminate rats. Instead, it led to the farming of rats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael G. Vann]], "Of Rats, Rice, and Race: The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre, an Episode in French Colonial History," French Colonial History Society, May, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Duplessis Orphans]]: Between 1945 and 1960, the federal Canadian government paid 70 cents a day per orphan to orphanages, and psychiatric hospitals received $2.25 per day, per patient. Allegedly, up to 20,000 orphaned children were falsely certified as mentally ill so the government of the province of [[Quebec]] could get $2.25 per day, per patient.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 Protesters in straitjackets demand inquiry of Duplessis Orphans era]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 Allegations of child abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 Orphans sue Catholic orders over mistreatment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extermination of sparrows in China that ate grain per the [[Four Pests Campaign]] led to the explosion of the Locust population and compounding the ecological problems already caused by the [[Great Leap Forward]].
* Funding [[fire department]]s by the number of fire calls made is intended to reward the fire departments that do the most work. However, it may discourage them from fire-prevention activities, which reduce the number of fires.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government (2002). [http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/review/consult/fire.pdf "Fire"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040801032503/http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/review/consult/fire.pdf |date=2004-08-01 }}.

*19th century [[palaeontology|palaeontologists]] travelling to [[China]] used to pay peasants for each fragment of [[dinosaur]] bone (dinosaur [[fossils]]) that they produced. They later discovered that the peasants dug up the bones and then smashed them into many pieces, greatly reducing their scientific value, to maximise their payments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Chinese peasants vs. palaeontologists example}}
* Paying medical professionals and reimbursing insured patients for treatment but not prevention encourages medical conditions to be ignored until treatment is required.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Robinson,
Reinvention of Health Insurance in the Consumer Era (2004). In ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]], April 21, 2004; 291: 1880–1886''. Retrieved 2008-01-12&lt;/ref&gt; Also, paying only for treatment effectively discourages prevention (which would reduce the demand for future treatments and would also improve quality of life for the patient). Payment for treatment also generates a perverse incentive for unnecessary treatments which could be harmful, for example in the form of side effects of drugs and surgery. These side effects themselves can then trigger a demand for further treatments.
* [[Bangkok]] police used [[tartan]] armbands as a badge of shame for minor infractions, but they were treated as collectibles by offending officers forced to wear them. Since 2007, they have been using armbands with the cute [[Hello Kitty]] cartoon character to avoid the perverse incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Myndans |first=Seth |date=2007-08-25 |title=Cute Kitty Is Pink Badge of Shame in Bangkok |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/world/asia/08thai.html |accessdate=2007-11-06 |quote=It is the pink armband of shame for wayward police officers, as cute as it can be, with a Hello Kitty face and a pair of linked hearts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Endangered Species Act]] in the US imposes development restrictions on landowners who find endangered species on their property. While this policy is well-intentioned and has some positive effects for wildlife, it also encourages preemptive habitat destruction (draining swamps or cutting down trees that might host valuable species) by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20wwln-freak-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=unintended%20consequences&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1 ''Unintended Consequences''], New York Times Magazine, 20 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, endangered species may even be [[shooting, shoveling, and shutting up|deliberately killed]] to avoid discovery. Similarly, if the fine or other penalty for committing environmental damage is perceived as less burdensome than the cost of preventing the damage in the first place, an individual or company may not place safeguards in place and simply pay the penalty if the damage occurs.
* Providing company executives with bonuses for reporting higher earnings encouraged executives at [[Fannie Mae]] and other large corporations to inflate earnings statements artificially and make decisions targeting short-term gains at the expense of long-term profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Bebchuk, L., &amp; Fried, J. M. (2005) [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1037596901/executive-compensation-at-fannie-mae-a-case-study "Executive Compensation at Fannie Mae: A Case Study of Perverse Incentives, Nonperformance Pay, and Camouflage"] ''Journal of Corporation Law'', '''30''' (4): 807–822.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Before the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], executed criminals were the only legal source of bodies for hospitals to use for surgeon training in the United Kingdom. Due to high demand from chronic shortage of legal cadavers, "[[Body-snatching|resurrection men]]" resorted to illegal means to obtain bodies, such as digging up corpses from graveyards or even murder. In 1828, [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke and William Hare]] murdered 16 people and sold the bodies. Thomas Williams and John Bishop, part of a group of body snatchers known as the [[London Burkers]], committed murder for the purpose of selling the victim's body in 1831.
* In building the [[first transcontinental railroad]] in the 1860s, the [[United States Congress]] agreed to pay the builders per mile of track laid. As a result, [[Thomas C. Durant]] of [[Union Pacific Railroad]] lengthened a section of the route forming a bow shape unnecessarily adding miles of track.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Zwonitzer, writer, PBS American Experience documentary "Transcontinental Railroad"  (2006) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/tcrr-transcript/ "Program Transcript . Transcontinental Railroad . WGBH American Experience" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[welfare trap]]" occurs when money earned through part-time or minimum-wage employment result in a reduction in [[state benefit]]s which is greater than that amount. This creates a barrier to low-income workers re-entering the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aims.ca/op-ed/gassing-up-the-welfare-trap-machine/ "Gassing up the welfare trap machine"], 6 January 1997, [[Atlantic Institute for Market Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying factors include a full tax exemption for public assistance while employment income is taxed, a pattern of welfare paying more per dependent child (while employers are prohibited from discriminating in this manner, and their workers often must purchase daycare), or loss of welfare eligibility for the working poor ending other means-tested benefits (public medical, dental or prescription drug plans, subsidised housing, legal aid) which are expensive to replace at full market rates. If the withdrawal of means-tested benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income or even a net loss, then this gives a powerful disincentive to take on such work.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* [[Real estate broker]]s have an inherent conflict of interest with sellers they represent because their usual commission structures motivate them to sell quickly more than it motivates them to sell at a higher price. However, a broker representing a buyer has a distinct disincentive to negotiate a lower price on behalf of their client, because they will simultaneously be negotiating their own commission lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why a Real Estate Agent May Skip the Extra Mile |author=Daniel Gross |date=20 Feb 2005 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/business/yourmoney/why-a-real-estate-agent-may-skip-the-extra-mile.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529190902/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/business/yourmoney/why-a-real-estate-agent-may-skip-the-extra-mile.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Real Estate Brokers Add Value When Listing Services Are Unbundled? |date=13 Jan 2012 |author1=B.

* Awarding carbon credits for destroying the greenhouse gas [[HFC-23]] incentivized increased manufacture of the refrigerant [[HCFC-22]] (chlorodifluoromethane) whose production included HFC-23 as a by-product.

* Under the US [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program, doctors are reimbursed at a higher rate if they prescribe more expensive medications to treat a condition.

* The [[devolved]] government in [[Northern Ireland]] enabled business owners to make profits guaranteed for 20 years by simply using more and more heating energy to heat their premises in their [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal|Renewable Heat Incentive]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38414486|title=RHI scandal: RHI 'cash for ash' scandal to cost NI taxpayers £490m|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the scheme were to ''reduce'' energy usage and promote switching to [[Environmentally friendly|green]] sources.
* The [[Wells Fargo account fraud scandal]] resulted from incentives intended to increase the number of accounts sold, but overly ambitious quotas combined with the threat of career ruin if quotas were not met caused some employees to open large numbers of accounts without customer permission.
* The 2008 housing crisis resulted in 27 million subprime mortages outstanding which government sponsored enterprises were mandated by government to own 19.2 million. The intent was for poorer people to own homes. The result was a housing bust, which led to low house prices, which led to financial institution instabilities which caused a greater proportion of poor people to lose their homes.

[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the [[Pitsa panels]], 6th century BCE, paint on wood, showing an animal sacrifice in [[Corinth]]]]
[[File:Pinax prothesis Louvre CA255.jpg|350px|thumb|Terracotta funerary pinax, Athens, 560-550 BC]] 
In the modern study of the culture of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Magna Graecia]], a '''''pinax''''' (πίναξ) (plural '''''pinakes''''' - πίνακες), meaning "board",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%2Fnac πίναξ],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a '''votive tablet''' of painted [[wood]], or [[terracotta]], [[marble]] or [[bronze]] [[relief]] that served as a [[votive deposit|votive object]] deposited in a [[sanctuary]] or as a memorial affixed within a [[burial chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such ''pinakes'' feature in the classical collections of most comprehensive museums.

==Other uses==
[[File:Pinax with Persephone and Hades Enthroned, 500-450 BC, Greek, Locri Epizephirii, Mannella district, Sanctuary of Persephone, terracotta - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08242.JPG|thumb|left|Terracotta pinax of [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]] from [[Locri]] (Museo Nazionale di [[Reggio di Calabria]])]]

To the ancient Greeks ''pinax'' seems also to have been a general term for a plate, but this is generally not followed in modern archaeological usage.  In daily life ''pinax'' might equally denote a wax-covered [[Wax tablet|writing tablet]]. In Christian contexts,  painted [[icon]]s ("images") are ''pinakes''. In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], they were images probably usually painted on cloth, but also carved either in stone or wood, that were hung behind, and sometimes below, the stage area as scenery, or as permanent decoration.  The term [[pinacotheca]] for a picture gallery derives from such usages.

==Materials and use==
When they are recovered by archaeologists, painted wooden ''pinakes'' have usually lost all but faint traces of their painted images - the [[Pitsa panels]] being the outstanding exception.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; Moulded terracotta ''pinakes'' were also brightly painted.  Marble ''pinakes'' were individually carved, but terracotta ones were impressed in molds, and bronze ones might be repeatedly cast from a model from which wax and resin impressions were made, in the technique called [[lost wax casting]]. 

A few elaborate gold plaques have survived from the 7th century BC, many made in [[Rhodes]], with deity figures, especially [[Artemis]], shown in an orientalizing [[Daedalic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

They often have two holes for a suspension cord, and are shown in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-paintings]] both hanging on temple walls, and also suspended from trees in the sanctuary area.  The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]  mentions the ''pinakes'' in the [[cella]]s of temples, and even in the possession of private persons. Such a collection was a ''pinakothek'',&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''bibliothek'', a library, which provides the designation in several modern European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a modern German term for an [[art museum]], such as the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of Munich.

[[Callimachus]], the Alexandrian poet and scholar at the [[Library of Alexandria]], formed a kind of index, or "map picture" of the library's contents, which he named ''[[Pinakes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc-mrg.english.ucsb.edu/conference/2002/documents/christian_jacob.html Christian Jacob, "From Alexandria to Alexandria: Scholarly Interfaces of a Universal Library" 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; a term that continued in use in bibliographic catalogs.

==Large finds==
[[File:Plaque Penteskouphia MNB2858.jpg|thumb|Pottery kiln, Penteskouphia]] 
At [[Locri]] in southern Italy, thousands of carefully buried ''pinakes'' have been recovered, most of them from the sanctuary of [[Persephone]] or that of [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127; [http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm The Pinakes of Locri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033135/http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm |date=2016-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another large group of over 1,000 pottery pinakes was found at the site of [[Penteskouphia]], just outside [[Corinth]].  These are mostly in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], with some in Corinth and the [[Louvre]].  As well as the usual religious scenes, some of these show depictions of potters at work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/votive-tablet Louvre, "Votive tablet"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Berlin also has a smaller group of fragments from the [[Kerameikos]] cemetery in [[Athens]], many by the painter [[Exekias]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Pinakes_by_Exekias_at_the_Antikensammlung_Berlin Commons category "Pinakes by Exekias at the Antikensammlung Berlin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruscan art==
In [[Etruscan art]], rather larger terracotta plaques than are typical in Greek art have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  Wealthy Etruscan families often had tombs with painted walls, which the Greeks did not.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term ''pixel art'' was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal, "ACM president's letter: Pixel Art", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 25, Issue 12, Dec. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"/&gt; [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bezier curve]], was introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]] followed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"&gt;Wands, Bruce. (2006) Art of the Digital Age, Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-23817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Flash]], a popular set of [[multimedia]] software used to add [[animation]] and [[interactivity]] to web pages, was introduced in 1996.

In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="Art, One Click at a Time"&gt;{{cite web

==Techniques==
[[File:Plaque rue du Cirque à Paris.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Pixel art outside the virtual domain using mosaic tiles by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]]]
[[File:ReconstructionsFromPixels.png|right|frame|A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square.  This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering.]]

The total number of pixels (''[[image resolution]]''), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called ''[[color depth]]'') determine the quality of an image.  For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits.  Likewise, an image [[sample (graphics)|sample]]d at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses [[data compression]] techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to [[image compression|compression techniques]] that lose information as [[lossy compression]].

Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 [[pixels per inch]] (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 [[dots per inch]] (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor.  Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process ([[CMYK]]) printing.
Drawings usually start with what is called the [[line art]], which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over [[image scanner|scanned]] drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or a [[graphics tablet]] and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling [[painting]], also exist, such as knowledge of the [[color theory]]. The limited palette often implemented into [[pixel art]] usually promotes the use of [[dithering]] in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.&lt;ref name="Flash Enabled: Fl"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''Private Libraries Association''' (PLA) came into being in 1956 when 18-year-old Philip Ward wrote a letter to the [[The Observer|Observer]] inviting booklovers and [[book collectors]] to attend a meeting to discuss the setting up of an association whose aims would be:-
*To help readers in the organisation, cataloguing and fuller enjoyment of their personal collections;
*To cover every subject field by voluntary organised specialisation, and to record locations for loans.&lt;ref&gt;David Chambers, editor, ''A Modest Collection'' (Pinner, Middlesex, Private Libraries Association, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-900002-67-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the membership has always included distinguished experts, it largely consists of ordinary collectors who share their enthusiasms and their knowledge. Since its foundation, the PLA has published a quarterly journal, originally called ''P.L.A. Quarterly'' but quickly renamed (from 1958) ''The Private Library''; since Spring 1968, the journal has appeared in a standard format of some 40-50 pages containing two or three illustrated articles. It also publishes a members’ book every year or two years. The articles and books are written by members and cover a wide range of subjects – classic fine printing and modern [[private press]]es, modern [[small press]]es and [[children's books]], [[illustrators]] and [[publishers]], famous books and the history of [[printing]], [[bookplates]] and [[bookbinding]], [[bookselling]], etc.. Details of the books and ''the Private Library'' can be found on the association’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plabooks.org/ The website of the Private Libraries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''reset button technique''' (based on the idea of ''[[status quo]] ante'') is a [[plot device]] that interrupts continuity in works of fiction. Simply put, use of a reset button device returns all characters and situations to the ''status quo'' they held before a major change of some sort was introduced.  Typically it occurs either in the middle of a program and negates a portion of it, or it occurs at the beginning, or very end, of a program to negate all that came before it.&lt;ref name="Kaveney"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Alien to the Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film |first=Roz|last=Kaveney |year=2005 |publisher=[[I. B. Tauris]] |isbn=1-85043-806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often used in [[science fiction]] [[television]] series, [[animated series]], [[soap opera]]s, and [[comic book]]s, the device allows elaborate and dramatic changes to characters and the fictional universe that might otherwise invalidate the premise of the show with respect to future episodes or issues [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. Writers may, for example, use the technique to allow the audience to experience the [[comic book death|death of the lead character]], which traditionally would not be possible without effectively ending the work.

==One-off use==

When this device is used in shows that do not use it regularly, its effective use depends on the audience being unaware of the continuity status until the moment when the intention to use the reset button technique is made clear.  This requires the show to cause successful suspension of disbelief in the audience while introducing plot developments that would seriously alter the future of the show, without revealing that continuity is or will be interrupted. It is frequently employed as a plot twist that effectively undoes all the happenings of the episode. Common uses of this technique draw liberally from science fiction and metaphysical ideas, perhaps contributing to its widespread use in those genres.

Examples of the reset button technique include dream sequences, alternate-history flashbacks, parallel universes, "alternate realities", "alternate timelines", daydreams, [[time travel]], and hallucinations. In one trope that uses this technique (typically in science fiction or fantasy), a character will find himself in a situation that seems familiar, but during the episode some things seem odd. Then one or more major events happen, such as a lead character having a significantly different position or dying. By the end of the episode or [[story arc]] the character learns they have been placed in a copy of their normal surroundings, usually to try to obtain information from them, and the mastermind behind the plan made a few mistakes in fashioning the copy environment.

Perhaps the most infamous example of the reset button technique is the [[1986 in American television|1986]] [[season premiere]] of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' in which it is revealed that [[Bobby Ewing]]'s death in the previous season was merely a [[dream]] in the mind of one of the characters. This was parodied in the "[[Da Boom]]" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]''. In [[comics]], the [[Spider-Man]] storyline ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'' undid the marriage of Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]], drawing criticism due to the continuity issues,{{who|date=May 2016}} with some critics even comparing it to ''Dallas''.

However, used appropriately, it can be devastating in terms of its effect. In the last episode of ''[[Newhart]]'', the title character (played by [[Bob Newhart]]) is struck on the head, knocked unconscious, then wakes up in bed next to Emily (played by [[Suzanne Pleshette]]), who had been his wife on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. Thus the entire series of ''Newhart'' was a dream.

==Use as a frequent plot device==

In many series, the reset button trope is used as a standard, and frequently explicit, plot device. 

Implicit usage of the technique can be seen in episodic fiction, such as when the results of episodes regularly cause what would seem to be massive changes in the status of characters and their world; however it is understood by the audience that subsequent episodes will not take into account such events. An example is ''[[South Park]]'', in which the character of [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] dies in almost every episode in early seasons, only to reappear in future episodes without explanation.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' is one show that generally uses this technique, while occasionally introducing lasting continuity changes. Creator [[Matt Groening]] referred to this flexibility as a "rubber band reality".&lt;ref name="LAT_1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lloyd|first1=Robert|title='The Simpsons': Q&amp;A with Matt Groening on reaching 500 episodes|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/02/qa-matt-groening-on-the-simpsons-at-500.html|accessdate=3 March 2017|work=LA Times|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reset-button using shows sometimes, as a form of [[self-referential humor]], point out their own use of the technique.

Alluding to the trope, the [[CBBC]] television series ''[[Hounded (TV series)|Hounded]]'' features a ''literal'' reset button that, at the end of each episode, rewinds the entire day's events back to the beginning.

In many episodic shows sudden changes to a character's past or attributes are not actually examples of the reset button technique, but merely a lack of continuity. For instance, in early episodes of the popular Fox TV show ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' Dr. Wilson's character was explicitly stated to be Jewish. However, in later episodes it was implied that he was not, such as in the episode "The Social Contract" when House tells Dr. Taub that he cannot hope to compete at racquetball against Dr. Wilson because "Wilson played tennis on his college team. And you are a Jew, you're not athletic."
  
In many adventure oriented series, the characters are defined essentially by what they do and encounter in the course of their adventures. Character development is kept to a bare minimum in favor of action and adventure. In some long-running series, characters do not appear to age, but are instead revised to fit the times. Examples of this include cartoon characters such as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], series movie characters such as [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]], and serial novel characters such as [[Mack Bolan]] and [[Nancy Drew]].
 
Simple failure to maintain continuity is not use of the reset button technique, although in some cases such a failure can be considered a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. For instance, when the [[Superman]] movies came out in the 1970s, the [[screenwriter]]s largely ignored the decades-long comic book [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] and frequently contradicted previous "facts". For example, in the comic books, [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], Superman's home planet, had a climate similar to Earth's, but in the movie series it had an icy climate.

The '''River North Gallery District'''  or simply '''River North''', in [[Chicago]], is in the [[Near North Side, Chicago]].  It hosts the largest concentration of [[Contemporary art gallery|art galleries]] in the [[United States]] outside of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | title = 2007 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon Runner Information | work = www.chicagomarathon.com | publisher = LaSalle Bank | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012212715/http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | archivedate = 2011-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
River North has experienced vast changes in the years 1990 - 2012 including the development of vast highrise buildings, nightclubs and restaurants.   River North has become one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially on and around Hubbard Street.

A common definition puts the River North neighborhood in the area north of the Chicago River and the [[Merchandise Mart]], south of [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]], east of the Chicago River and west of Wabash Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rivernorthassociation.com|title=River North Business Association - RNBA - Home|website=www.rivernorthassociation.com|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with hundreds of art galleries, the area holds many bars, dance clubs, popular restaurants and entertainment venues. Subsections of River North include:

* The Gallery District, the district designated by the City, primarily along Chicago, Superior and Huron streets between Lasalle and Orleans.  As it has grown and the area has gentrified, galleries can also now be found west of Orleans and east of LaSalle, though the core area still contains the highest concentration of galleries.

* A design district, with shops and showrooms selling commercial and luxury interior furnishings, in the blocks north of the Merchandise Mart.
* Kingsbury Park, an area of newly built residential high-rises surrounding Erie Park, at Erie Street and the Chicago River.

==History==

===Smokey Hollow===

River North was named Smokey Hollow around the turn of the 20th century due to the many factories and forges in the area. The smoke was often so thick that sunlight was blocked. At the time Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River with the surrounding areas. The Merchandise Mart still has railroad tracks underneath the building.  Massive [[coal bin]]s were throughout the neighborhood both bringing coal into the area from ships and storage for the multitude of factories and forges in River North. The Merchandise Mart was a major storage warehouse for goods. The Merchandise Mart was later purchased by the Kennedy family. Former retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North.

===Little Sicily===

Little Sicily in Chicago was also located in River North.  The city's first Italian Roman Catholic Church in Chicago was Assumption Parish on Illinois Street, with a mandate to be the Parish for all Italians living between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River.  Later Sicilians began to move northward from the immediate vicinity of Assumption and began to form their own parishes. Italians whose family roots were from other parts of Italy tended to move west along Grand Street and formed Parishes west of Assumption.

===Prohibition===

In 1921, Dean O'Banion married Viola Kaniff and bought an interest in William Schofield's River North flower shop, near the corner of West Chicago Avenue and North State Street.  O'Banion needed a legitimate front for his bootlegging operation. In addition, he was fond of flowers and was an excellent arranger.

Schofield's became the florist of choice for many funerals.

The shop happened to be directly across the street from Holy Name Cathedral, where O'Banion and Weiss attended Mass. The rooms above Schofield's were used as the headquarters for the North Side Gang which controlled the bootlegging operations in what would later be called River North and the Gold Coast area of Chicago.

On the morning of November 10, 1924, O'Banion was clipping chrysanthemums in Schofield's back room. Frankie Yale entered the shop with Torrio and Capone gunmen John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. When O'Banion attempted to greet Yale with a handshake, Yale clasped O'Banion's hand in a death grip.    At the same time, Scalise and Anselmi fired two bullets into O'Banion's chest, two in his cheeks, and two in his throat and Dean O'Banion died instantly.

===Punk rock history===

One of the biggest punk rock clubs of the 1970s was located in River North - called O'Banion's after the infamous hit on Dean O'Banion.

The River North neighborhood fell on difficult times starting in the 1960s with many families moving into the suburbs to escape urban blight.  Many buildings were torn down and became parking lots. Crime was a dangerous part of daily life.

Assumption Church on Illinois Street during this time reported that many of its Parishioners had moved to the suburbs and that few people remained living within its Parish boundaries as established by the Archdiocese of Chicago. Assumption Parish survived during this time on Parishioners who traveled from the suburbs to attend Mass in the old neighborhood every Sunday.

===Development of the River North neighborhood===

[[Image:20090518 Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago.jpg|thumb|310px|[[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] as viewed from the [[Chicago River]]]]

The River North neighborhood got its name from Chicago real estate developer Albert Friedman (chief executive of Friedman Properties Ltd.), who in 1974 started to buy, restore and build commercial property in the southeast sector.&lt;ref name=tribune11&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/chi-river-north_chomes_0711jul11,0,1786787.story | title = River North: From gritty roots to urban chic | work = www.chicagotribune.com | publisher = Chicago Tribune | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-11 | first=Susan | last=Diesenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the area was a [[skid row]] at the time, so in an effort to attract tenants Friedman started calling the area "River North".&lt;ref name=tribune11/&gt; Within a few years, Friedman found photographers, ad agencies and art galleries willing to rent the low cost space and coalesce into what is now the River North Gallery District,&lt;ref name=tribune11/&gt; which has the largest concentration of art galleries in the United States outside of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | title = 2007 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon Runner Information | work = www.chicagomarathon.com | publisher = LaSalle Bank | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012212715/http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | archivedate = 2011-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
River North from 1990 to 2012 became one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially along Franklin Street and Hubbard Street. It is a top destination for restaurants, nightclubs and living for people who move to Chicago.  During this time numerous highrises have been developed, dramatically increasing the population of River North.

'''''Still Life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels''''' (Dutch: ''Stilleven met kazen, amandelen en krakelingen'') is a [[painting]] by the Dutch artist [[Clara Peeters]]. It seems to have been made circa 1615.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.mauritshuis.nl/nl-nl/verdiep/de-collectie/kunstwerken/stilleven-met-kazen-amandelen-en-krakelingen-1203/&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[still life]], painted in oils on a wooden panel. This is 34,5&amp;nbsp;cm high and 49,5&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Clara Peeters has painted her signature in the handle of the depicted knife.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mauritshuis.nl/nl-nl/verdiep/de-collectie/kunstwerken/stilleven-met-kazen-amandelen-en-krakelingen-1203/detailgegevens/&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is displayed in the [[Mauritshuis]] museum in [[The Hague]].

[[Clara Peeters]] specialised in [[still life]]s with beautiful objects, delicious fruits and expensive food. This type of still life is called "banketje" (banquet) in Dutch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The symbolism of these paintings is not fully known. It could be an encouragement to temperance, or a reference to [[The Last Supper]]. Or it might simply be a display of opulence and wealth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/files/media/ekw_rijkdomweelde_3ster_web_0_0_0_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In this painting, in addition to the objects named in the title, there are also curls of butter, figs and a bread roll. In the background is a gold-plated [[Venetian glass]]. The almonds and figs are lying in a dish of Chinese [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historiek.net/mauritshuis-verwerft-bijzonder-stilleven-clara-peeters/16719/ |title=Mauritshuis verwerft bijzonder stilleven Clara Peeters |accessdate=2016-06-29 |date=2012-06-20 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peeters often used the objects in this painting in her still lifes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the reflective cover of the [[Bartmann jug|"bartmann" jug]] behind the cheese Clara Peeters painted her own portrait. She thus followed the example of [[Jan van Eyck]], who painted his self-portrait in 1434 in his famous double portrait of the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' couple.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Clara Peeters made a total of seven self-portraits, including this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vn.nl/clara-peeters/ |title=Clara Peeters, bescheiden schilder van stillevens |accessdate=2016-06-29 |date=2016-06-28 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purchase ==
The [[Mauritshuis]] museum in [[The Hague]] has the still life of Clara Peters, which it acquired in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volkskrant.nl/beeldende-kunst/mauritshuis-verwerft-stilleven-clara-peeters~a3273681/&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was made possible by the support of the Vereniging Rembrandt, the A.M. Roeters van Lennep Fonds, the Utrechtse Rembrandt Cirkel and the Caius Fonds&lt;!--we could use InterLanguageLinks for all four of these organisations--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verenigingrembrandt.nl/152/de-kunst/gesteunde-kunst/stilleven-met-kazen-amandelen-en-krakelingen/?id=100006556&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

On June 22, 2014 a special episode of the TV show '' Kunstuur '' described the renovated Mauritshuis. The Dutch minister [[Jet Bussemaker]] explained why ''Still Life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels'' was her favorite painting in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npo.nl/kunstuur/22-06-2014/AT_2016684&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7984">'''''Tevot''''' is a one-movement [[symphony]] for [[orchestra]] by the British composer [[Thomas Adès]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and [[Carnegie Hall]].  The world premiere was given by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of [[Simon Rattle]] at the [[Berliner Philharmonie]] on February 21, 2007.  The United States premiere was given by the same ensemble at Carnegie Hall on November 14, 2007.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Thomas Adès|Adès, Thomas]] (2007). [http://thomasades.com/compositions/tevot Tevot: Program Note]. Retrieved May 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huizenga |first=Tom |title=Berlin Philharmonic, in Concert at Carnegie Hall |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=November 13, 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16227797 |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Lawrence A. |title=15 illegal minutes with Thomas Ades |work=South Florida Classical Review |date=November 20, 2008 |url=http://southfloridaclassicalreview.com/2008/11/15-illegal-minutes-with-thomas-ades/ |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''Tevot'' has is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]] and has a duration of roughly 22 minutes.

===Background===
The title of the piece comes from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "bars of music."  In the score program note, Adès added, "Also, in the Bible, (tey-VA) is the [[Noah's Ark|ark]] of [[Noah]], and the cradle in which the baby [[Moses]] is carried on the river."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;  The composer further described the meaning in an interview with Tom Service of ''[[The Guardian]]'', remarking, "I liked the idea that the bars of the music were carrying the notes as a sort of family through the piece. And they do, because without bars, you'd have musical chaos. But I was thinking about the ark, the vessel, in the piece as the earth. The earth would be a spaceship, a ship that carries us - and several other species! - through the chaos of space in safety. It sounds a bit colossal, but it's the idea of the ship of the world."  He continued, "I thought of the piece as one huge journey, but in order to make that journey truthful, to give it movement, there had to be many quite sudden and instant changes of landscape."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |last=Service |first=Tom |title=An empire ablaze |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 February 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/26/classicalmusicandopera.tomservice |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adès also recalled a sense of urgency writing the piece, saying, "I couldn't sleep at night. I would feel that I would absolutely die if I didn't succeed in bringing the piece to harbour. It would have been a frightening feeling not to do that. It's more than a need - it feels essential. It's like transporting a person through the air, and you have to make sure they land in one piece."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising five [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd, 4th, &amp; 5th doubling [[piccolo]]s; 3rd doubling [[bass flute]]), five [[oboe]]s (4th doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]; 5th doubling [[bass oboe]]), five [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[E-flat clarinet]]; 4th doubling E-flat and A clarinets; 5th doubling [[contrabass clarinet]]), four [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], eight [[French horn|horns]], five [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, two [[tuba]]s, [[timpani]], two percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
''Tevot'' has been praised by music critics.  [[Tom Service]] wrote, "Of any piece of new music I've heard at its premiere, this is one of the most immediately, richly powerful."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  Reviewing the United States premiere, [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, "In this arresting performance ''Tevot'' announced itself as an instantly essential new work."  Tommasini further wrote:{{quote|It begins with eerily skittish high figurations in the strings that sound at once ominous and angelic. Moaning swells emerge from the lower orchestra, and the music builds in intensity and complexity until, in an attempt to break free, a volley of 12-tone-like riffs wildly erupts, clearing away the angst. The piece segues into its most rhythmically agitated and harmonically gnashing episode.

Then a passage of consoling music with sighing lyrical fragments begins, and you are sure the calming coda to the piece has arrived. Not so. Mr. Adès prolongs this episode for roughly half of the work's nearly 25-minute length. He keeps coming up with new variants of layered harmony, instrumental sonorities and supple rhythmic figures that keep you hooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=Simon Rattle's Berliners Bring Mahler and More |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 16, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/arts/music/16ratt.html |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Richard Whitehouse of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' called ''Tevot'' "an eventful 22 minutes" and wrote, "From a shimmering opening that erupts in energetic exchanges, it builds a momentum underpinned by the antagonism between tuned anvils and an oboe-led chorale. Reaching an expressive plateau, the piece recalls its start via a descent that gives the stratospheric violin-writing a definite harmonic context, before the climactic final section attempts more overt tonal closure."&lt;ref name="Gramophone"&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitehouse |first=Richard |title=Ades Tevot; Violin Concerto |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=April 2010 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/ades-tevot-violin-concerto |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Swed of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' observed, "Like ''[[America: A Prophecy|America]]'', this journey begins with another weird swirl -- this one, though, more music of the spheres. After a section of vigorous, brash dance music, ''Tevot'' settles down into long, calming, [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] peace seeking, awed slow music of haunting beauty."  He added, "Ades doesn't hold back in his music. When it's raw, it's raw. When it's cooked, it gets four stars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swed |first=Mark |title=Ades, for mature audiences only |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 17, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/17/entertainment/et-phil17 |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Ivan Hewett of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was critical of the work, writing, "I was staggered and appalled at the piece's unstoppable energy, as pitiless as a lava flow, and waited for the high, still chorale on violins at the piece's core, hoping this time I would be moved by it. But it seemed ice-cold as ever, and the grandeur of the ending a mite Hollywood-ish. This is a piece that's either hot or cold, but never warm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hewett |first=Ivan |title=London Sinfonietta/CBSO, Aldeburgh Festival, review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=22 June 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalconcertreviews/10917712/City-of-Birmingham-Symphony-Orchestra-Aldeburgh-Festival-review.html |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A recording of ''Tevot'' performed by Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic was released through [[EMI Classics]] on March 23, 2010.  The disk also features Adès's [[Violin Concerto (Adès)|Violin Concerto]], among other of the composer's works.&lt;ref name="Gramophone" /&gt;

Apollinaire first intended this book to be a general collection of his writings on art entitled ''Méditations Esthétiques'' rather than specifically on Cubism. In the fall of 1912 he revised the page proofs to include more material on the Cubist painters, adding the subtitle, ''Les Peintres Cubistes''. When the book went to press, the original title was enclosed in [[bracket]]s and reduced in size, while the subtitle ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' was enlarged, dominating the cover. Yet ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' appears only on the half t.p. and t.p. pages, while every other page has the title ''Méditations Esthétiques'', suggesting the modification was made so late that only the title pages were reprinted.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breunig, Chevalier"&gt;Leroy C.

==Author==
[[File:Apollinaire Rouveyre 1914.webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.5|Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Rouveyre]] in 1914]]
Guillaume Apollinaire, a French poet, playwright, short story writer, novelist, and art critic, served as a decisive interface between artists and poets of the early 20th century, joining the [[visual arts]] and literary circles.&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt; Italian by birth, Polish by name (Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki), Parisian by choice, Apollinaire was a leading figure in early modernist poetry, a permutable figure whose work echoed the [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]], the Cubists and foresaw the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]].

As an active figure in well-established literary journals from 1902 to his death in 1918, Apollinaire played a crucial role in the development of early modernism by founding his own artistic journals, by supporting galleries and exhibitions, as a collector of [[avant-garde]] art, and as an impassioned supporter of a divers group of emerging artists.&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt; His pervasive influence on these artists is exemplified by a multitude of portraits of Apollinaire painted by artists such as [[Henri Rousseau]], Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger, [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], Marie Laurencin, Marcel Duchamp, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Marc Chagall]], Pierre Savigny de Belay and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4911615&amp;sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Jean Metzinger, 1910, Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire, Christie's Paris, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photo.rmn.fr/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;VBID=2CO5PCSIW6_O&amp;SMLS=1&amp;RW=1092&amp;RH=584 Ministère de la Culture - Médiathèque du Patrimoine, Dist.

:"Apollinaire, like Baudelaire", writes Pamela A. Genova, "was a self-taught art critic, and he began his art theory naïve to the technical terminology and to the conventional precepts of the field. His work was spontaneous, impetuous, and ahead of its time, and like many ''avant-garde'' pioneers, he was often misunderstood, underestimated, or disregarded. Yet for one who began as a novice in the appreciation, analysis, and promotion of painting, the accuracy of Apollinaire's taste is uncanny, for his favorite painters [for example the artists he includes in ''Les Peintres Cubistes''] are now considered among the most influential artists of the century".&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire, c. 1916.jpg|thumb|Guillaume Apollinaire during the spring of 1916 after his shrapnel wound to the temple]]
As a close friend of all the Cubists, and Marie Laurencin's lover, Apollinaire witnessed the development of Cubism firsthand. He was in close contact with [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] and its habitués—including [[Max Jacob]], [[Maurice Princet]], Picasso, Braque and Metzinger. He was also in close contact with the [[Section d'Or|Groupe de Puteaux (or Section d'Or)]], based in the western suburbs of Paris—including the Duchamp brothers, Gleizes, Picabia and again Metzinger (who associated with both groups early on).

Apollinaire coined several important terms of the avant-garde, such as [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] (at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912)&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Hajo Düchting, ''Orphism'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Surrealism]] (concerning the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' in 1917),&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Clébert, ''Dictionnaire du surréalisme'', A.T.P. &amp; Le Seuil, Chamalières, p. 17, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hargrove, Nancy (1998).

(''Les Peintres Cubistes'', p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;

==Volume==
Guillaume Apollinaire's only book on art, ''The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations'' is an unsystematic collection of reflections and commentaries.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', and ''Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; It was written between 1905 and 1912, and ultimately published in 1913. Composed of two parts, the volume demonstrates the poetic vision of Apollinaire. The first part, "On Painting" (''Sur la peinture''), is a manifesto for the new art form, consisting of seven chapters (22 pages), of which much of the text was written in 1912 and published in ''{{Ill|Les Soirées de Paris|fr}}'' the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Part II adapted from Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Du sujet dans la peinture moderne'', Les Soirées de Paris, No. 1, Feb. 1912, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part III, IV and V adapted from Guillaume Apollinaire, ''La peinture moderne'', Les Soirées de Paris, No. 3, April 1912, pp. 89-92, and No. 4, May 1912, pp. 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA220 Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248], {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and larger section of the book (53 pages), under the heading "New Painters" (''Peintres nouveaux''), analyzes the work of ten artists most representative of the movement in the following order: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin, Gris, Léger, Picabia, Duchamp, and in the Appendix, Duchamp-Villon. In the section on [[Marie Laurencin]], Apollinaire included a text a [[Henri Rousseau]], first published in a review of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants (L'Intransigéant, 10 April 1911).&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Included are four reproductions of the works by each artist (with the exception of Rousseau), and portrait photographs of Metzinger, Gleizes, Gris, Picabia, and Duchamp.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

A landmark in the history of art criticism, this essay synthesizes the aesthetic preoccupations of not just the Cubists, but of Apollinaire himself. The volume is valued today as a work of reference and a vintage example of creative modernist writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520243545 Guillaume Apollinaire, "Les Peintres Cubistes" (The Cubist Painters) published in 1913], Peter Read (Translator), University of California Press, 25 Oct. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;q=metzinger#v=snippet&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Guillaume Apollinaire, "Les Peintres Cubistes" (The Cubist Painters) published in 1913], (translated and analyzed by Peter F. Read, University of California Press, 25 Oct. 2004 (back cover)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the third attempt to define the new pictorial trend burgeoning during the years before the First World War, following ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, 1912,&lt;ref name="Du Cubisme" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; and [[André Salmon]], ''Histoire anecdotique du cubisme'' (''Anecdotal History of Cubism''), 1912.&lt;ref name="Salmon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon 1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon 2005" /&gt;

In his analysis of the new [[art movement]], Apollinaire makes a distinction between four different types of Cubism;&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, ''Scientific Cubism'', is the art of painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from the reality of vision, but from the reality of knowledge. It is the tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

The second, ''Physical Cubism'', is the discipline of constructing painting with elements borrowed mostly from the reality of vision. Its social role is well marked, but it is not a pure art. The 'physicist' who created this trend is Le Fauconnier.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

''Orphic Cubism'' is the art of painting with elements borrowed not from visual reality, but entirely created by the artist and endowed by him with a powerful reality. The works of the Orphic artists simultaneously present a pure aesthetic pleasure, a construction to the senses and a sublime meaning. This is pure art, according to Apollinaire, that includes the work of R. Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and M. Duchamp.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

''Instinctive Cubism'' is, according to Apollinaire, the art of painting elements borrowed not from visual reality, but suggestive of the artist's instinct and intuition. Instinctive Cubism includes a very large number of artists. Derived from French Impressionism, the movement spans ("is spreading") across all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from ''Du "Cubisme"'' and Apollinaire's ''Les Peintres Cubistes''.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund, pp. 19-20]&lt;/ref&gt; It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered exclusively on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt; The terms "Analytical Cubism" and "Synthetic Cubism" which subsequently emerged (overshadowing Apollinaire's classification scheme) have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. However, both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt; This interpretation of Cubism, formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, is difficult to apply to other Cubist's whose art fundamentally differed from the 'Analytic' or 'Synthetic' categories, compelled Kahnweiler to question their right to be called Cubists at all. According to Robbins, "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

Other terms have surfaced since. In his book,''The Cubist Epoch'', [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] divides Cubism into three phases: "Early Cubism" (from 1906 to 1908), when the movement was initially developed in the ateliers of Picasso and Braque; "High Cubism" (from 1909 to 1914), during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and  "Late Cubism" (from 1914 to 1921), the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement, according to Christopher Green.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

The current trend in the classification of Cubist styles reflects Apollinaire's wider view of the movement, more so than others. Cubism is once again no longer definitively attached to the art of a specific group or even a movement. It embraces vastly disparate work; applying to artists in different socio-cultural environments and settings. And despite the difficulties of classification, Cubism, as predicted by Apollinaire in 1913, has been called the first and the most influential of all movements in 20th-century art.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

===''On Painting''===
Apollinaire stressed the importance of what he perceived as virtues of the [[plastic arts]]: purity, unity, and truth; all of which would keep "nature in subjection". He deplored the violent attacks waged against the Cubist's preoccupation with geometry; geometrical figures being the essence of drawing. "Geometry, the science of space, its dimensions and relations, has always determined the norms and rules of painting."

Before Cubism, the three dimensions of Euclidean geometry had been sufficient for artists. But according to Apollinaire, "geometry is to the plastic arts what grammar is to the art of the writer". Artists, just as scientists, no longer had to limit themselves to three spatial dimensions. They were guided by intuition, to preoccupy themselves with the new possibilities of spatial measurement which included the 'fourth dimension'. This fictitious realm represented the "immensity of space eternalizing itself in all directions at any given moment". This utopian expression stood for the aspiration and premonitions of artists who contemplated Egyptian, African, and oceanic sculptures; who meditated on various scientific works, and who lived "in anticipation of a sublime art".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Picasso, with his planes to denote volume, "gives an enumeration so complete" that objects are entirely transformed, "thanks to the effort of the spectator, who is forced to see all the elements simultaneously". In questioning whether Picasso's art is profound rather than noble, Apollinaire answers, "It does not dispense with the observation of nature, and acts upon us as intimately as nature itself."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

====Georges Braque====
It was Braque who, at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] of 1908, first exhibited to the public works whose geometric preoccupations began to dominate the composition. Picasso's work, though not exhibited, set the precedent. This transformation, believed Apollinaire, was in perfect harmony with the society in which the painter evolved. Braque's role was "heroic", his art "peaceful and admirable", writes the poet, "He expresses a beauty, a beauty full of tenderness, and the pearl-like quality of his pictures irradiates our understanding. He is an angelic painter."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

====Jean Metzinger====
[[File:Jean Metzinger, portrait photograph, published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|Jean Metzinger]]
Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist, observed Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, ''Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900–1930'', International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
Describing Metzinger, Apollinaire claims this 'great painter's work had not yet been fully appreciated, despite the design, composition, the contrasted lights and an overall style'. His works were "set apart" above and beyond many of the works of his contemporaries. "It was then that Jean Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the Cubist City."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

There was "nothing incomplete" in the works of Metzinger. His works were the "fruit of a rigorous logic" writes the author. When explaining the art of our epoch, "his work will be one of the surest documents". Metzinger's paintings contained their own 'explanation'. For Apollinaire this was a case "unique in the history of art".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt; For Apollinaire, Metzinger had purity; "his meditations take beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach the sublime... entirely stripped of all that was known before him. [...] Each one of his pictures contains a judgment of the universe and his entire work resembles a nocturnal firmament when it is clear, free from all clouds and trembling with adorable lights. There is nothing incomplete in his works, poetry ennobles the smallest details."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Albert Gleizes====
[[File:Albert Gleizes, portrait photograph, published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|Albert Gleizes]]
The works of Gleizes show "powerful harmonies", but Apollinaire warns of confounding his paintings with the "theoretical cubism" of the "scientific painters". Referring to the writings of Gleizes, Apollinaire cites the will of the artist to "bring back his art to his simplest elements".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Gleizes had understood the influence of Cézanne on the Cubists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic#anchor1044900 Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, From Cézanne to Cubism'', Kubismus, 1928 and Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929, translation by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; writes Apollinaire. The work of Gleizes, he continues, has "a degree of plasticity such that all the elements which constitute the individual characters are represented with the same dramatic majesty".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Majesty above all characterized the art of Gleizes, bringing a startling innovation to contemporary art, as few of the modern painters had done before. "This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination... the immensity of things. This art is vigorous... realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Marie Laurencin====
The art of Laurencin (and women more generally) brought a "new vision full of the joy of the universe", an "entirely feminine aesthetic" writes Apollinaire. As an artist, he placed Laurencin between Picasso and Le Douanier Rousseau, not as a hierarchical indication, but as a statement of relationship. "Her art dances, like Salome, between that of Picasso, who like a new John the Baptist bathes all the arts in a baptism of light, and that of Rousseau, a sentimental Herod." The author states the similarities to dance and "rhythmic enumeration, infinitely gracious in painting".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

:"Feminine Art, the art of Laurencin, tends to become a pure arabesque humanized by an attentive observation of nature, which, being expressive, forsakes simple decoration while remaining just as agreeable."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=====Henri Rousseau=====
Rousseau had past away in September 1910. Apollinaire made clear the great esteem held by the Cubist painters for his works, calling Rousseau the "Inhabitant of Delight". It was for Apollinaire the qualities of his work that made his painting "so charming to look at". Few artists had been mocked during their lifetime as Rousseau, and even fewer had faced with equal calm the hail of insults. And happily, writes Apollinaire, he "was able to find, in insults and mockeries, evidence that even the ill-intentioned could not disregard his work".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

[[File:Juan Gris, portrait photograph, published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|140px|Juan Gris]]
Rousseau had painted two portraits of Apollinaire: "I often watched him at work, and I know the care he gave to the tiniest details; he had the capacity to keep the original and definitive conception of his picture always before him until he had realized it; and he left nothing, above all, nothing essential, to chance. Its nervous draftsmanship, variety, charm, and delicacy of tones make this work's excellence. His pictures of flowers show the resources of charm and emphasis in the soul and hand of the Douanier."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

====Juan Gris====
Gris had "meditated on everything modern", painting "to conceive only new structures" and "materially pure forms".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1299783137937502&amp;view=mjp_object The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 2: Miscellany Number, Anderson, Margaret C. (editor), New York, 1922-12, Winter 1922, pp. 49-60]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire compares the work of Gris with the "scientific cubism" of Picasso, "his only master", a type of drawing that was geometrical individualized, "a profoundly intellectual art, according to color a merely symbolic significance". His works had "purity, scientifically conceived", and "from this purity parallels are sure to spring".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Fernand Léger====
Léger is described as a talented artist. "I love his art because it is not scornful, because it knows no servility, and because it does not reason. I love your light colors [''couleurs légers''], O Fernand Léger! Fantasy does not lift you to fairylands, but it grants you all your joys."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Francis Picabia====
[[File:Francis Picabia, photograph published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|140px|Francis Picabia]]
Just as the Impressionists and the Fauves, Picabia "translated light into color", arriving at "an entirely new art". His color was not just a "luminous transposition" without "symbolic significance". It was a "form and light of whatever is represented".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

As in the works of Robert Delaunay, color was for Picabia "the ideal dimension", one that incorporated all other dimensions. Form was symbolic, while the color remained formal. It was "a perfectly legitimate art, and surely a very subtle one". Color was saturated with energy and prolonged in space.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

The title for Picabia was intellectually inseparable from the work to which it referred, playing a role as actual objects. Analogous to Picabia's titles, real objects, "are the pictorial arabesques in the backgrounds of Laurencin's pictures. With Albert Gleizes this function is taken by the right angles which retain light, with Fernand Léger by bubbles, with Metzinger by vertical lines, parallel to the sides of the frame cut by infrequent echelons." Apollinaire found equivalence in the works of all the great painters. "It gives pictorial intensity to a painting, and this is enough to justify its legitimacy."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

It was not a question of abstraction, but of "direct pleasure". Surprise played an important role. "Can the taste of a peach be called abstract?" mused the author. Each picture of Picabia "has a definite existence, the limits of which are set by the title". Picabia's paintings were so far from ''a priori'' abstractions that "the painter can tell you the history of each one of them. ''Dance at the Spring'' is simply the expression of a plastic emotion experienced spontaneously near Naples".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, photograph published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|110px|Marcel Duchamp]]

====Marcel Duchamp====
To date, Duchamp's production had been too spars and differed considerably from one painting to the next. Apollinaire hesitated to make any broad generalizations, noting rather Duchamp's apparent talent and his abandoning of "the cult of appearances". To free his art from all perceptions, Duchamp wrote the titles on the paintings themselves. "This literature, which so few painters have been able to avoid, disappears from his art, but not poetry. He uses forms and colors, not to render appearances, but to penetrate the essential nature of forms and formal colors... Perhaps it will be the task of an artist as detached from aesthetic preoccupations, and as intent on the energetic as Marcel Duchamp, to reconcile art and the people."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Appendix===

====Duchamp-Villon====
The departure of sculpture from nature tends toward architecture, writes Apollinaire: "The utilitarian end aimed at by most contemporary architects is responsible for the great backwardness of architecture as compared with the other arts. The architect, the engineer should have sublime aims: to build the highest tower, to prepare for time and ivy the most beautiful of ruins, to throw across a harbor or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbow, and finally to compose to a lasting harmony, the most powerful ever imagined by man. Duchamp-Villon had this titanic conception of architecture. A sculptor and an architect, light is the only thing that count for him; but in all the arts, also, it is only light, the incorruptible light, that counts."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

====Note====
Besides the artists of whom Apollinaire writes in preceding chapters, there were other artists and writers alike attached, "whether willingly or not", to the Cubist movement. ''Scientific Cubism'' was defended by [[Ricciotto Canudo]], Jacques Nayral, [[André Salmon]], Joseph Granié, [[Maurice Raynal]], [[Marc Brésil]], [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], André Tudesq, {{Interlanguage link multi|André Warnod|fr}}, Georges Deniker, [[Jacques Villon]], and [[Louis Marcoussis]]. ''Physical Cubism'' was supported in the press by the writers listed above, in addition to {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}}, [[Olivier Hourcade]], [[Jean Marchand (painter)|Jean Marchand]], [[Auguste Herbin]], and Véra. ''Orphic Cubism'' was defended by [[Max Goth]], [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Henry Valensi|fr}}. Certain artists associated with ''Instinctive Cubism'' were supported by [[Louis Vauxcelles]], [[René Blum (ballet)]], Adilphe Basler, [[Gustave Kahn]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and Michel Puy. According to Apollinaire this trend included [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Chabaud]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Gino Severini]], and [[Umberto Boccioni]]. In addition to Duchamp-Villon, other Cubist sculptors included [[Auguste Agéro]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], and [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

'''''The Passing of the Armies''''', full title '''''The Passing of the Armies; An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based Upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps'''''&lt;ref&gt;The full title of the book is ''The Passing of the Armies; An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based Upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38664535].&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[American Civil War]] memoir written by [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], a renowned commander most famous for his actions on [[Little Round Top]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. It is an autobiographical account describing Chamberlain's experiences throughout the latter half of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], on and off the battlefield. It follows his accounts through [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]], [[Battle of White Oak Road|White Oak Road]], [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]], and [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] (where Chamberlain was given the honor of accepting the [[Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House#Surrender|Confederate surrender]]).  Throughout the book, Chamberlain frequently expresses his respect for the soldiers of both the [[Confederate States of America| Confederacy]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)| Union]]. It was published by [[Putnam and Sons]] in 1915, a year after Chamberlain's death.

==Appomattox==

Respect for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, a common theme in the book, was never expressed greater than at [[Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House#Surrender|the surrender at Appomattox]]. Chamberlain recalled the events: 

''"We Formed...to face the last line of battle, and receive the last remnant of the arms and colors of that great army which ours had been created to confront for all that death can do for life."''

Chamberlain goes on to recount how the withered remnants of the armies, formerly robust and strong at the beginning of the war, met each other. The remnants of [[John Bell Hood|Hood]]'s division at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] united with the [[III Corps (Union Army)|Union Third Corps]] exchanging mutual respect. He explains how [[Longstreet's corps]] could not be greeted properly after having exchanged volleys of fire and death with each other.

'''''The Tower of Babel''''' was the subject of three paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. The first, a miniature painted on ivory, was painted while Bruegel was in Rome and is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 6, one of the works belonging to [[Giulio Clovio]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morra|first=Joanne|title=Utopia Lost: Allegory, Ruins and Pieter Bruegel’s Towers of Babel|journal=Art History|year=2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=200|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.2007.00538.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two surviving paintings, often distinguished by the prefix "Great" and "Little", are in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]] and the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] respectively.  Both are [[oil painting]]s on wood panels.

The Rotterdam painting is about half the size of the Vienna one. In broad terms they have exactly the same composition, but at a detailed level everything is different, whether in the architecture of the tower or in the sky and the landscape around the tower.  The Vienna version has a group in the foreground, with the main figure presumably [[Nimrod]], who was believed to have ordered the construction of the tower,&lt;ref name="Art and the Bible" /&gt; although the Bible does not actually say this.  In Vienna the tower rises at the edge of a large city, but the Rotterdam tower is in open countryside. 

The paintings depict the construction of the [[Tower of Babel]], which, according to the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]], was built by a unified, [[Confusion of tongues|monolingual]] humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: "Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'" (Genesis 11:4).

==Description and analysis==
Bruegel's depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and other examples of [[Roman engineering]], is deliberately reminiscent of the Roman [[Colosseum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malam|first=John|title=Pieter Bruegel|year=1999|publisher=Carolrhoda Books|isbn=1-57505-366-7|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Christians of the time saw as a symbol of both hubris and persecution. Bruegel had visited [[Rome]] in 1552–1553. Back in [[Antwerp]], he may have refreshed his memory of Rome with a series of engravings of the principal landmarks of the city made by the publisher of his own prints, [[Hieronymous Cock]], for he incorporated details of Cock's engravings of Roman views in both surviving versions of the ''Tower of Babel''.  

The parallel of Rome and [[Babylon]] had a particular significance for Bruegel's contemporaries: Rome was the Eternal City, intended by the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] to last forever, and its decay and ruin were taken to symbolize the vanity and transience of earthly efforts.&lt;ref name="Art and the Bible"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tower of Babel|url=http://www.artbible.info/art/tower-of-babel.html|work=Art and the Bible|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower was also symbolic of the religious turmoil between the [[Catholic church]] (which at the time conducted all services in Latin) and the polyglot Protestant religion that was increasingly popular in the [[Netherlands]].  The subject may have had a specific topicality, as the famous [[Plantin Polyglot|Polyglot Bible]] in six languages, a landmark in Biblical scholarship, was published in Antwerp in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 502&lt;/ref&gt;  Although at first glance the tower appears to be a stable series of concentric pillars, upon closer examination it is apparent that none of the layers lies at a true horizontal. Rather the tower is built as an ascending spiral.

The workers in the painting have built the [[arch]]es perpendicular to the slanted ground, thereby making them unstable, and a few arches can already be seen crumbling. The foundation and bottom layers of the tower had not been completed before the higher layers were constructed.
[[File:La Tour de Babel, Van Valckenborch, 1594.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Van Valckenborch's ''Tower of Babel'' 1594]]
[[Lucas van Valckenborch]], a contemporary of Bruegel's, also painted the Tower of Babel in the 1560s and later in his career, possibly after seeing Bruegel's depiction.&lt;ref name="Art and the Bible" /&gt; Both were part of a larger tradition of painting the tower during the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew West (linguist)|title=72 More Views of the Tower of Babel|url=http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2008/12/72-more-views-of-tower-of-babel.html|work=BabelStone|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (detail) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail at right side, with original rock formation.]]

The story of the [[Tower of Babel]] (like that in [[The Suicide of Saul]], Bruegel's only other painting with an [[Old Testament]] subject) was interpreted as an example of pride punished, and that is no doubt what Bruegel intended his painting to illustrate.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the hectic activity of the engineers, masons and workmen points to a second moral: the futility of much human endeavour. [[Nimrod]]'s doomed building was used to illustrate this meaning in [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]]''.&lt;ref&gt;This book's online text may be viewed at [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20179 ''The Ship of Fools''], [[Project Gutenberg]]. See also article by N. Collins, on [http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/tower-of-babel.htm Encyclopedia of Art Education] Accessed 4 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Bruegel's knowledge of building procedures and techniques is considerable and correct in detail. The skill with which he has shown these activities recalls that his very last commission, left unfinished at his death, was for a series of documentary paintings recording the digging of a canal linking [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Allegretti, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both towers are shown partly-built with stone facings over a massive brick framework, a typical technique in [[Roman architecture]], used in the Colosseum and other huge Roman buildings.  Grand and formal architecture of this sort is not a usual interest of Bruegel in either paintings or drawings, although it was typical subject matter for many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 502; Orenstein, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;  Nadine Orenstein, in discussing his only known drawing of buildings in Rome, concludes from the details taken from the Colosseum in both ''Tower'' paintings that he "must" have recorded them in drawings on his visit ten years before, but given the easy availability of prints this does not seem conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 96-97; see [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=712020&amp;partId=1 this British Museum page] for another drawing of Roman ruins, perhaps the Colosseum, recently attributed to Bruegel&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no surviving drawings that are studies for this or any other of Bruegel's paintings. This is despite indications that Bruegel did make use of preparatory studies. Both ''Tower'' versions are full of the type of details which are likely to have been worked out in sketches first.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;  Except for a lack of mountains, the paintings contain the main ingredients of the [[world landscape]], a type of composition followed in many of Bruegel's earlier landscapes.  The Vienna tower is built around a very steep small mountain, which can be seen protruding from the architecture at the centre near the ground and to the right higher up.

==Provenance==
The Vienna painting is signed and dated "Brvegel. FE. M.CCCCC.LXIII ", on the stone block directly in front of the king.  It was painted in 1563 for the Antwerp banker [[Nicolaes Jonghelinck]],&lt;ref name="khm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=323 |title=KHM Bilddatenbank |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103131309/http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=323 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Bruegel's best patrons, who owned no fewer than 16 of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

The painting appears as the main element on one box art design of the video game ''[[Civilization III]]''.

They are briefly mentioned in ''[[Shadow Man (video game)|Shadowman]]'', where Jaunty explains that Bruegel was shocked at how The Asylum resembled his paintings.

The painting also makes an appearance in the 2012 video game, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 2]]'', in the zombie survival mode in the map, 'Green Run' on a wall in a section of the map (Town).

'''''The Wolf of Wall Street''''' is a [[memoir]] by former [[stockbroker]] and trader [[Jordan Belfort]], first published in September 2007 by [[Bantam Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title = The Wolf of Wall Street by Jordan Belfort|asin = 0553805460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522776.The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=The Wolf of Wall Street (The Wolf Of Wall Street #1) by Jordan Belfort (Goodreads Author)|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; then adapted into a 2013 [[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|film of the same name]] (directed by [[Martin Scorsese]] and starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Belfort).  Belfort's autobiographical account was continued by ''[[Catching the Wolf of Wall Street]]'', published in 2009.

==Overview==
Belfort tells his real-life story of creating [[Stratton Oakmont]], a brokerage house engaged in [[pump and dump]] schemes with [[penny stock]]s. The firm was shut down by regulators in the late 1990s, and Belfort was jailed for securities fraud.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1441">Utah Designer Craftsmen was an artists' cooperative founded in 1960 by [[Dorothy Bearnson]] and [[Angelo Caravaglia]]. In 2000, it was renamed the Utah Designer Craft Alliance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Craft alliance creates an intriguing exhibit| work = DeseretNews.com| accessdate = 2017-06-09| date = 2001-03-25| url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/833033/Craft-alliance-creates-an-intriguing-exhibit.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since it was founded, UDC hosted annual competitive exhibitions, although they were not continuous, especially from the 1990s on. Some of the exhibitions were held at the Utah Art Barn.

During the 1980s, UDC had their own gallery, the Utah Designer Craftsmen Gallery, at 38 W. 200 South, in [[Salt Lake City]], UT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = EMERGING ARTISTS&lt;BR&gt; GALLERIES ARE LOOKING FOR, SPOTLIGHTING NEW TALENT| work = DeseretNews.com| accessdate = 2017-06-09| date = 1988-07-24| url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/11799/EMERGING-ARTISTS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, the organization folded for good, donating remaining funds to the [[Brigham City Museum-Gallery|Brigham City Museum of Art &amp; History]] to use for one final show, to be held in 2018 or 2019. 

Artists who have been associated with UDC include Bruce Larrabee, Joseph Bennion, Susan Harris, Kathleen Royster, Steve Hansen, Larry Elsner, and many others.

In 1887, while [[Vincent van Gogh]] was residing in [[Paris]], he executed an oil painting commonly known as '''''Wheat Field with a Lark'''''.

The center part shows a partially harvested field of wheat under a sky patterned with light clouds. A lark takes flight toward the upper left of the canvas.

The painting measures 54 x 65.5 cm (approximately 21-1/4 x 25-3/4 inches) and is housed in the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].

'''''Wrestlers''''' is a name shared by three closely related 1899 paintings by American artist [[Thomas Eakins]], ([[List of works by Thomas Eakins|Goodrich catalog #317, #318, #319]]). The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA) owns the finished painting (G-317), and the [[oil sketch]] (G-318). The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] (PMA) owns a slightly smaller unfinished version (G-319). All three works depict a pair of nearly naked men engaged in a [[wrestling]] match. The setting for the finished painting is the [[Fairmount Rowing Association|Quaker City Barge Club]] (defunct), which once stood on Philadelphia's [[Boathouse Row]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Silverberg, ''A Very Brief History of the Fairmount Rowing Association'' (Fairmount Rowing Association, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eakins painted a series of works depicting [[Rowing|scullers]] on the [[Schuylkill River]] in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Helen A. Cooper, ''Thomas Eakins: The Rowing Pictures'' (Yale University Art Gallery, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1890s, he painted three major works depicting [[Boxing|boxers]]&amp;mdash;''[[Taking the Count]]'' (1898), [[Yale University Art Gallery]]; ''[[Salutat]]'' (1898), [[Addison Gallery of American Art]]; ''[[Between Rounds]]'' (1899), Philadelphia Museum of Art.

On May 22, 1899, Eakins had two wrestlers pose in his 4th-floor studio at [[Thomas Eakins House|1729 Mount Vernon Street]], [[Philadelphia]]. Three days earlier, he had written to his friend, sportswriter Clarence Cranmer: "I am going to start the wrestling picture on Monday at half past two. I wish you could find it convenient to be at the studio and help us with advice as to positions and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;TE to Cranmer, May 19, 1899; cited in an August 29, 1931 letter from Cranmer to Fiske Kimball in the PMA Archives. Siegl, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's protégé [[Samuel Murray]] may have been present; he modeled a small sculpture of the wrestlers that is also dated 1899.&lt;ref name="Siegl"/&gt; Eakins painted the works from the live models and from a nearly identical photograph, that may have been taken that day. The photograph shows the wrestler on top holding the other in a [[Nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] and crotch hold.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Hendricks, ''The Photographs of Thomas Eakins'' (Grossman Publishers, 1972), plate 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

PMA's unfinished version (G-319) was painted before the finished painting (G-317), and is thought to be an abandoned composition rather than a [[Study (art)|study]].&lt;ref name="Siegl"&gt;Theodor Siegl, ''The Thomas Eakins Collection: The Philadelphia Museum of Art'' (PMA, 1978), pp.&amp;nbsp;149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; LACMA's finished painting (G-317) is larger, and features a well-defined setting with additional figures in the background. LACMA's oil sketch (G-318) varies from the other paintings in the position of the head and shoulders of the wrestler on top.

Author Allen Guttmann has compared Eakins' ''Wrestlers'' to [[George Luks]]' ''[[The Wrestlers (Luks)|The Wrestlers]]'' (1905) and [[Max Slevogt]]'s ''Wrestling School'' (1893), writing that all three paintings depict pairs of nude wrestling men lying on the ground in [[grappling hold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Guttmann, ''The Erotic in Sports'' (Columbia University Press, 1996), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provenances===
====G-317====
Eakins painted the work for the National Academy Museum in New York in 1902 as his so-called diploma painting when he was inducted into membership. 70 years later, the academy sold it to the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. In 2005, Columbus sold it to Adelson Galleries in New York.  In 2006 LACMA acquired it as the gift of Cecile C. Bartman, at one time a museum docent, and the Cecile and Fred Bartman Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight, "Eakins' 'Wrestlers' takes a winding road to LACMA." Los Angeles Times, Dec. 25, 2008. http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/25/entertainment/et-wrestlers25,&lt;/ref&gt;

====G-319====
Eakins died in 1916, and a collection of his unsold paintings was exhibited at the 1926 [[Sesquicentennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Siegl"/&gt; PMA Director [[Fiske Kimball]] saw the abandoned version of ''Wrestlers'' at the world's fair, and inquired about buying it. According to Kimball, Cranmer (who was acting as the dealer for Eakins's widow) said the abandoned version had been valued low, and had not been included in the Eakins memorial exhibitions of a decade earlier.&lt;ref name="Siegl"/&gt; "He [Cranmer] said he would find out the price. It was $400. I bought it and by Christmas 1926 it was hanging in the library at [[Lemon Hill]]."&lt;ref name="Siegl"/&gt; Letters from Cranmer to Kimball in the PMA Archives identify the wrestler on top as Joseph McCann, but do not identify the man on the bottom.&lt;ref name="Siegl"/&gt; Kimball died in 1955, and made the abandoned version a bequest to his museum.

====G-318====
William Preston Harrison bought the oil sketch for ''Wrestlers'' in 1927, from a touring exhibition of Eakins works.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/07/thomas-eakins-sports-paintings-at-lacma.html "Art review: 'Manly Pursuits: The Sporting Images of Thomas Eakins' @ LACMA,"] ''The Los Angeles Times'', July 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison died in 1940, and made the early sketch a bequest to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt; Eileen Fort, "Whither the Wrestlers." American Quarterly, vol. 62 no. 2, 2010, pp. 395-402.&lt;/ref&gt;
