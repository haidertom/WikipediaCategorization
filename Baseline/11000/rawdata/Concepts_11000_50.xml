      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3472">In [[mathematics]], an '''adjunction space''' (or '''attaching space''') is a common construction in [[topology]] where one [[topological space]] is attached or "glued" onto another. Specifically, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces with ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''Y''. Let ''f'' : ''A'' → ''X'' be a [[continuous (topology)|continuous map]] (called the '''attaching map'''). One forms the adjunction space ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' by taking the [[disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] of ''X'' and ''Y'' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identifying]] ''y'' with ''f''(''y'') for all ''y'' in ''A''. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;X\cup_f Y = (X\amalg Y) / \{f(A) \sim A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, the adjunction is written as &lt;math&gt;X+\!_f \,Y&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, one may think of ''Y'' as being glued onto ''X'' via the map ''f''.

As a set, ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' consists of the disjoint union of ''X'' and (''Y'' − ''A''). The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. In the case where ''A'' is a [[closed set|closed]] subspace of ''Y'' one can show that the map ''X'' → ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' is a closed [[embedding]] and (''Y'' − ''A'') → ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' is an open embedding.

==Examples==
*A common example of an adjunction space is given when ''Y'' is a closed ''n''-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]] (or ''cell'') and ''A'' is the boundary of the ball, the (''n''−1)-[[sphere]]. Inductively attaching cells along their spherical boundaries to this space results in an example of a [[CW complex]].
*Adjunction spaces are also used to define [[connected sum]]s of [[manifold]]s. Here, one first removes open balls from ''X'' and ''Y'' before attaching the boundaries of the removed balls along an attaching map.
*If ''A'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the [[wedge sum]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.
*If ''X'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the quotient ''Y''/''A''.

==Categorical description==
The attaching construction is an example of a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. That is to say, the adjunction space is [[universal property|universal]] with respect to following [[commutative diagram]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
[[Image:AdjunctionSpace-01.svg|175px]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Here ''i'' is the [[inclusion map]] and φ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the maps obtained by composing the quotient map with the canonical injections into the disjoint union of ''X'' and ''Y''. One can form a more general pushout by replacing ''i'' with an arbitrary continuous map ''g'' &amp;mdash; the construction is similar. Conversely, if ''f'' is also an inclusion the attaching construction is to simply glue ''X'' and ''Y'' together along their common subspace.

'''Alice Stokes Paul''' (January 11, 1885 – July 9, 1977) was an American [[suffragist]], [[feminist]], and [[women's rights]] activist, and one of the main leaders and strategists of the campaign for the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits sex discrimination in the right to vote. Paul initiated, and along with [[Lucy Burns]] and others, strategized events such as the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] and the [[Silent Sentinels]], which were part of the successful campaign that resulted in the amendment's passage in 1920.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Baker, Jean H., "[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/placards-white-house Placards At The White House]," [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']], Winter 2010, Volume 59, Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1920, Paul spent a half century as leader of the [[National Woman's Party]], which fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], written by Paul and [[Crystal Eastman]], to secure constitutional equality for women. She won a large degree of success with the inclusion of women as a group protected against discrimination by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Women's rights|Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

==Background==

===Early life===
Alice Paul was born on January 11, 1885, at [[Paulsdale]] in [[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Paul|url=https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/alice-paul|website=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Eve M. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/13/garden/group-seeks-to-buy-a-suffragist-s-home.html "Group Seeks to Buy a Suffragist's Home"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 13, 1989. Accessed July 12, 2008. "The Alice Paul Centennial Foundation plans to buy the house in Mount Laurel, but first the organization must raise $500,000 by Sept. 8.... The 2½-story, stucco-clad brick farmhouse was built in 1840 and once overlooked the Paul family's 173-acre Burlington County farm, east of Camden. Miss Paul was born in an upstairs bedroom in 1885 and lived in the house until she left for Swarthmore College in 1901."&lt;/ref&gt; She was the eldest of four children of William Mickle Paul I (1850–1902) and Tacie Paul (née Parry), and a descendant of [[William Penn]], the [[Quaker]] founder of [[Pennsylvania]]. Her siblings were Willam, Helen, and Parry. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; her ancestors included participants in the [[New Jersey]] Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. Alice first learned about women's suffrage from her mother, a member of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA); Paul would sometimes join her mother in attending suffragist meetings.&lt;ref name=Institute&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Was Alice Paul|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909083624/http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|archivedate=September 9, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:AlicePaulHelenGardener.png|thumb|upright|290px|Alice Paul and Helen Gardener, ca. 1908–1915]]

Paul attended [[Moorestown Friends School]], where she graduated at the top of her class.&lt;ref name = Education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/people/paul-alice-stokes/|title=Paul, Alice Stokes|work=Social Welfare History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Paul went to [[Swarthmore College]], an institution co-founded by her grandfather.  While attending Swarthmore, Paul served as a member on the Executive Board of Student Government, one experience which may have sparked her eventual excitement for political activism. Alice graduated from Swarthmore College with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1905.&lt;ref name=Institute/&gt;

Partly in order to avoid going into teaching work, Paul completed a fellowship year at a [[Settlement movement|settlement house]] in New York City after her graduation, living on the Lower East Side at the College Settlement House.  While working on settlement activities taught her about the need to right injustice in America, Alice soon decided that social work was not the way she was to achieve this goal: "I knew in a very short time I was never going to be a social worker, because I could see that social workers were not doing much good in the world... you couldn't change the situation by social work."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Paul in oral history compiled by Amelia Fry, [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6f59n89c/?brand=oac4 Online Archive of California], quoted in {{harvp|Adams|Keene|2008|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul then earned a master of arts from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1907, after completing coursework in political science, sociology and economics.&lt;ref name = Institute/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign|last=Adams|first=Katherine|last2=Keene|first2=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-252-07471-4|location=Urbana-Champaign|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at the [[Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre]] in [[Birmingham]], England, and took economics classes from the [[University of Birmingham]], while continuing to earn money doing social work. She first heard [[Christabel Pankhurst]] speak at Birmingham. When she later moved to London to study sociology and economics at the London School of Economics, she joined the militant suffrage group the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) led by Christabel and her mother, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. She was arrested repeatedly during suffrage demonstrations and served three jail terms. After returning from England in 1910, Paul continued her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in sociology.  Her dissertation was entitled "The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania"; it discussed the history of the women's movement in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S., and urged woman suffrage as the key issue of the day.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{harvp|Adams|Keene|2008|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul later received her law degree (LL.B) from the [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]] in 1922, after the suffrage fight was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/history/alicepaul.cfm |title=Honoring Alice Paul |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Washington College of Law]] |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, she earned a [[master of laws]] degree, and in 1928, a doctorate in civil law from American University.&lt;ref name=Lakewood&gt;{{cite news|title=Alice Paul Biography. |work=Lakewood Public Library:  Women in History |url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/paul-ali.htm |accessdate=May 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192543/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/paul-ali.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Britain===

====Early work in British woman suffrage====
In 1907, after completing her master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Paul moved to England, where she eventually became deeply involved with the British women's suffrage movement, regularly participating in demonstrations and marches of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). After a "conversion experience" seeing [[Christabel Pankhurst]] speak at the University of Birmingham, Paul became enamored with the movement. She first became involved by selling a Suffragist magazine on street corners. This was a particularly difficult task considering the animosity towards the Suffragists and opened her eyes to the abuse that women involved in the movement faced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These experiences, combined with the teachings of Professor [[Beatrice Webb]], convinced Paul that social work and charity could not bring about the needed social changes in society: this could only be accomplished through equal legal status for women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While in London, Paul also met [[Lucy Burns]], a fellow American activist who would become an important ally for the duration of the suffrage fight, first in England, then in the United States. The two women quickly gained the trust of prominent WSPU members and began organizing events and campaign offices. When [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] attempted to spread the movement to Scotland, Paul and Burns accompanied her as assistants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paul quickly gained the trust of fellow WSPU members through both her talent with visual rhetoric and her willingness to put herself in physical danger in order to increase the visibility of the suffrage movement. While at the WSPU's headquarters in Edinburgh, Paul and local suffragists made plans to protest a speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]]. For a week prior, they spoke with people on the streets to promote knowledge about why they were protesting against the Cabinet member. At the meeting, after Grey discussed proposed legislation he claimed would lead to prosperity, Paul stood up and exclaimed: “Well, these are very wonderful ideals, but couldn’t you extend them to women?”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Police responded by dragging her out of the meeting and through the streets to the police station where she was arrested. As planned, this act was viewed by many as a public silencing of legitimate protest and resulted in an increase of press coverage and public sympathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later events involved even more risk of bodily harm. Before a political meeting at St. Andrew's Hall in Glasgow in August 1909, Paul camped out on the roof of the hall so that she could address the crowd below. When she was forced by police to descend, crowds cheered her effort. Later, when Paul, Burns, and fellow suffragettes attempted to enter the event, they were beaten by police as sympathetic bystanders attempted to protect them. After Paul and her fellow protesters were taken into custody, crowds gathered outside the police station demanding the women's release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fotheringham |first1=Ann |title=Thanks for the Memories: Glasgow's Votes for Women celebration at Mitchell |url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16900627.thanks-for-the-memories-glasgows-votes-for-women-celebration-at-mitchell/ |website=Evening Times |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 1909, in honor of Lord Mayor's Day, the Lord Mayor of London hosted a banquet for cabinet ministers in the city's Guild Hall. Alice Paul planned the WSPU's response; she and Amelia Brown disguised themselves as cleaning women and entered into the building with the normal staff at 9:00 am. Once in the building, the women hid until the event started that evening. It was then that they came out of hiding and "took their stand." When Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith stood to speak, Brown threw her shoe through a pane of stained glass and both women yelled "Votes for women!" Following this event, both women were arrested and sentenced to one month hard labor after refusing to pay fines and damages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Civil disobedience ====
While associated with the Women's Social and Political Union, Paul was arrested seven times and imprisoned three times.&lt;ref name="Dodd"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodd|first=Lynda G.|year=2008|title=Parades, pickets, and prison: Alice Paul and the virtues of unruly constitutional citizenship|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Politics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=339–443|ssrn=2226351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during her time in prison that Paul learned the tactics of civil disobedience from Emmeline Pankhurst. Chief among these tactics was demanding to be treated as a political prisoner upon arrest. This not only sent a message about the legitimacy of the suffragists to the public, but also had the potential to provide tangible benefits. In many European countries, including England, political prisoners were given a special status: "[T]hey were not searched upon arrest, not housed with the rest of the prisoner population, not required to wear prison garb, and not force-fed if they engaged in hunger strikes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though arrested suffragettes often were not afforded the status of political prisoners, this form of civil disobedience provided a lot of press for the WSPU. For example, during a London arrest (after being denied political prisoner status), Paul refused to put on prisoner's clothing. After the prison matrons were unable to forcibly undress her, they requested assistance from male guards. This shockingly improper act provided extensive press coverage for the suffrage movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another popular civil disobedience tactic used by the Suffragettes was hunger striking. The first WSPU related hunger strike was conducted by sculptor [[Marion Wallace Dunlop]] in June 1909. By that fall it was being widely used by WSPU members because of its effectiveness in publicizing their mistreatment and gaining quick release from prison wardens. Refusing food worked in securing an early release for Paul during her first two arrests. However, during her third prison stint, the warden ordered twice daily force-feeding to keep Paul strong enough to finish out her month-long sentence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Though the prisons staunchly maintained that the force-feeding of prisoners was for their own benefit, Paul and other women described the process as torturous. At the end of her month in prison, Paul had developed severe [[gastritis]]. She was carried out of prison and immediately tended to by a doctor. However, after this event, her health was permanently scarred; she often developed colds and flu which would sometimes require hospitalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alice Paul: Equality for Women|last=Lunardini|first=Christine|publisher=Westview Press|year=2012|isbn=9780813347615|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

After the ordeal of her final London imprisonment, Paul returned to the United States in January 1910 to continue her recovery and to develop a plan for suffrage work back home.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; Paul's experiences in England were well-publicized, and the American news media quickly began following her actions upon her return home. She drew upon the teachings of Woodbrooke and her religion and quickly decided that she wanted to embrace a single goal as a testimony. The single goal she chose was the recognition of women as equal citizens.

Paul re-enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing her Ph.D., while speaking about her experiences in the British suffrage movement to Quaker audiences and starting to work towards United States suffrage on the local level.  After completing her dissertation, a comprehensive overview of the history of the legal status of United States women, she began participating in [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) rallies, and in April 1910 was asked to speak at NAWSA's annual convention. After this major opportunity, Paul and Burns proposed to NAWSA leadership a campaign to gain a federal amendment guaranteeing the vote for women. This was wholly contrary to NAWSA's state-by-state strategy. Paul and Burns were laughed at by NAWSA leadership; the only exception was [[Jane Addams]], who suggested that the women tone down their plan. As a response, Paul asked to be placed on the organization's Congressional Committee.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession ====
[[File:Inez Milholland 1913 two.jpg|thumb|290px|[[Inez Milholland]] leading the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] on horseback.]]
One of Paul's first big projects was initiating and organizing the 1913 [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] in Washington the day before President Wilson's inauguration. Paul was determined to put pressure on Wilson, because the President would have the most influence over Congress. She assigned volunteers to contact suffragists around the nation and recruit supporters to march in the parade. In a matter of weeks, Paul succeeded in gathering roughly eight-thousand marchers, representing most of the country. However, she had much more trouble gaining institutional support for the protest parade. Paul was insistent that the parade route go along Pennsylvania Avenue before President Wilson. The goal was to send the message that the push for women's suffrage existed before Wilson and would outlast him if need be. This route was originally resisted by DC officials, and according to biographer Christine Lunardini, Paul was the only one who truly believed the parade would take place on that route. Eventually the city ceded the route to NAWSA. However, this was not the end of the parade's troubles. The City Supervisor Sylvester claimed that the women would not be safe marching along the Pennsylvania Avenue route and strongly suggested the group move the parade. Paul responded by demanding Sylvester provide more police; something that was not done. On March 13, 1913 the parade gained a boost in legitimacy as Congress passed a special resolution ordering Sylvester to prohibit all ordinary traffic along the parade route and "prevent any interference" with the suffrage marchers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Official program - Woman suffrage procession March 3, 1913 - crop.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to the program for the 1913 [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] which Alice Paul organized]]
On the day of the event, the procession proceeded along Paul's desired route. The event, which was led by notable labor lawyer [[Inez Milholland]] dressed in white and riding a horse was described by the New York Times as "one of the most impressively beautiful spectacles ever staged in this country."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Multiple bands, banners, squadrons, chariots, and floats were also displayed in the parade representing all women's lives. One of the most notable sights was the lead banner in the parade which declared, "We Demand an Amendment to the United States Constitution Enfranchising the Women of the Country.&lt;ref name="Dodd" /&gt; "Over half a million people came to view the parade and with insufficient police protection, the situation soon devolved into a near-riot, with onlookers pressing so close to the women that they were unable to proceed. Police largely did nothing to protect the women from rioters. A senator who participated in the march later testified that he personally took the badge numbers of 22 officers who had stood idle, including 2 sergeants. Eventually, the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania national guards stepped in and students from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland Agricultural College]] provided a human barrier to help the women pass. Some accounts even describe Boy Scouts as stepping in and providing first aid to the injured. The incident mobilized public dialogue about the police response to the women's demonstration, producing greater awareness and sympathy for NAWSA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodd" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the parade, the NAWSA's focus was lobbying for a [[constitutional amendment]] to secure the right to vote for women. Such an amendment had originally been sought by suffragists [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] who, as leaders of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association|NWSA]], fought for a federal amendment to the constitution securing women's suffrage until the 1890 formation of NAWSA, which campaigned for the vote on a state-by-state basis.

==== National Woman's Party====

Paul's militant methods started to create tension between her and the leaders of NAWSA, who thought she was moving too aggressively in Washington. Eventually, disagreements about strategy and tactics led to a break with NAWSA. Paul formed the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage and, later, the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP) in 1916.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014|pp=178–231}}

The NWP began introducing some of the methods used by the suffrage movement in Britain and focused entirely on achieving a constitutional amendment for woman suffrage.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; [[Alva Belmont]], a multi-millionaire socialite at the time, was the largest donor to Paul's efforts. The NWP was accompanied by press coverage and the publication of the weekly newspaper, ''[[The Suffragist]].''&lt;ref name=Lakewood/&gt;

====Silent Sentinels====

In the [[United States presidential election, 1916|US presidential election]] of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other incumbent [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] at the [[White House]]. The pickets, participating in a [[nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] campaign known as the "[[Silent Sentinels]]," held banners demanding the right to vote.

After the United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of "obstructing traffic." Over the next six months, many, including Alice, were convicted and incarcerated at the [[Occoquan Workhouse]] in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the [[District of Columbia]] Jail.&lt;ref name=Lakewood/&gt;

When the public heard the news of the first arrests some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The ''Boston Journal'', for example, stated, "The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation."&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt;

Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as "Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?".&lt;ref name = Night&gt;{{cite web|first=Louise|last=Bernikow|date=October 30, 2004|url=http://womensenews.org/story/our-story/041029/night-terror-leads-womens-vote-1917#.U073a1xbtuY|title=Night of Terror Leads to Women's Vote in 1917|website=Women's eNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed.  While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters.  Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten.  Even though they were protesting during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. Throughout this time, more protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail. Pardons were no longer offered.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt;

===Prison, hunger strikes, passage of 19th Amendment===
[[File:Alice Paul cph.3a38295.jpg|thumb|Alice Paul in 1918]]
[[File:Alice paul.jpg|thumb|right|Alice Paul toasting (with grape juice) passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. August 26, 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|title=Who Was Alice Paul?|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In solidarity with other activists in her organization, Paul purposefully strove to receive the seven-month jail sentence that started on October 20, 1917. She began serving her time in the District Jail.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014|pp=279–281}}

Whether sent to Occoquan or the District Jail, the women were given no special treatment as political prisoners and had to live in harsh conditions with poor sanitation, infested food, and dreadful facilities.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; In protest of the conditions at the District Jail, Paul began a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/11/07/102646016.pdf "Miss Alice Paul on Hunger Strike"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 7, 1917. Accessed June 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to her being moved to the prison's psychiatric ward and being [[Force-feeding|force-fed]] raw eggs through a feeding tube. "Seems almost unthinkable now, doesn't it?" Paul told an interviewer from [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']] when asked about the forced feeding. "It was shocking that a government of men could look with such extreme contempt on a movement that was asking nothing except such a simple little thing as the right to vote."&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Robert S., "[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Ci-was-arrested-course%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D I Was Arrested, Of Course…]", [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']], February 1974, Volume 25, Issue 2. Interview of Alice Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 1917, the suffragists who were imprisoned at Occoquan endured brutality which became known as the "[[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]". The National Woman's Party (NWP) went to court to protest the treatment of the women in Occoquan Prison. The women were later moved to the District Jail where Paul languished. Despite the [[Police brutality in the United States|brutality]] that she experienced and witnessed, Paul remained undaunted, and on November 27 and 28 all the suffragists were released from prison.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014|pp=178–231}}

===Equal Rights Amendment===
Once suffrage was achieved in 1920 Paul and her party shifted attention to constitutional guarantees of equality through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]],&lt;ref name=Lakewood /&gt; which was written by Paul and [[Crystal Eastman]]. The larger rival the [[League of Women Voters]] (LWV) opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. The LWV also supported workplace legislation for women, whereas the NWP thought that workplace legislation restricted women's natural ability to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Decades of Discontent: The Women's Movement, 1920–1940|last = Scharf|first = Lois|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1983|isbn = 0313226946|location = Westport|pages = 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964 Civil Rights Act===
{{main article|Civil Rights Act of 1964#Women's rights}}

Paul played a major role in adding protection for women in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the opposition of liberals who feared it would end protective labor laws for women.  The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by [[Howard W. Smith]], a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133.  For twenty years Smith had sponsored the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the House because he believed in equal rights for women, even though he opposed equal rights for blacks.  For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially to Paul.  She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm |first1=Jo |last1=Freeman |title=How 'Sex' Got into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy |journal=Law and Inequality |volume=9 |issue=2 |date=March 1991 |pages=163–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==

Paul had an active social life until she moved to Washington in late 1912. She enjoyed close relationships with women and befriended and occasionally dated men. Paul did not preserve private correspondence for the most part, so few details about her personal life are available. Once Paul devoted herself to winning the vote for women, she placed the suffrage effort first in her life. Nevertheless, Elsie Hill and Dora Kelly Lewis, two women whom she met early in her work for NAWSA, remained close to her all their lives. She knew William Parker, a scholar she met at the University of Pennsylvania, for several years; he may have tendered a marriage proposal in 1917. A more thorough discussion of Paul's familial relations and friendships is found in J.D. Zahniser's biography.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014}}

Paul died at the age of 92 on July 9, 1977, at the Greenleaf Extension Home, a Quaker facility in [[Moorestown, New Jersey]], less than a mile from her birthplace and childhood home at [[Paulsdale]].&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; She is buried at Westfield Friends Burial Ground, [[Cinnaminson, New Jersey]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Legacy==
[[File:Alice Paul-unc-obv.jpg|thumb|Alice Paul was honored in 2012 on a $10 U.S. gold coin]]
In 1979 Paul was inducted, posthumously, into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/alice-paul/|title=Alice Paul|work=National Women's Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her alma mater, [[Swarthmore College]], named a dormitory Alice Paul Residence Hall in her honor. [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey has also named a dormitory (Alice Paul Hall) in her honor.

Two countries have honored her by issuing a postage stamp: Great Britain in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amazingwomenrock.com/alice-paul-suffragettepolitical-activist|title=Alice Paul (Suffragette/Political Activist)|last=Macaulay|first=Susan|website=amazingwomenrock.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States in 1995. The U.S. stamp was the $0.78  [[Great Americans series]] stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arago.si.edu/category_2043117.html|title=78-Cent Paul|last=|first=|date=6 July 1995|website=Arago: People, Postage &amp; The Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a group of New Jersey women raised the money to purchase Alice Paul's papers when they came up for auction, so that an archive could be established. Her papers and memorabilia are now held by the [[Schlesinger Library]] in Boston and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington D.C. In 1990, the same group, now the Alice Paul Institute, purchased the brick farmhouse, [[Paulsdale]], in Mount Laurel, New Jersey where Paul was born. Paulsdale is a National Historic Landmark, and is on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places.  The Alice Paul Institute keeps her legacy alive with their mission to promote gender equality.&lt;ref name = Institute/&gt;

[[Hilary Swank]] played Paul in the 2004 movie ''[[Iron Jawed Angels]]'', which portrayed the 1910 women's suffrage movement for passage of the 19th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://suffrageandthemedia.org/source/iron-jawed-angels-film-suffrage-activists/|title=Iron Jawed Angels, a Film About Suffragist Alice Paul - Women's Suffrage and the Media|work=Women's Suffrage and the Media|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, she was posthumously inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/03/alice_paul_inducted_into_nj_ha.html|title=Alice Paul inducted into NJ hall of fame alongside historic nemesis Woodrow Wilson|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul appeared on a United States half-ounce $10 gold coin in 2012, as part of the First Spouse Gold Coin Series. A provision in the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program]]&lt;ref&gt;see {{USStatute|109|145|119|2664|2005|12|22}})&lt;/ref&gt; directs that Presidential spouses be honored. As President [[Chester A. Arthur]] was a widower, Paul is shown representing "Arthur's era".&lt;ref name="Alice Paul USC"&gt;Alice Paul is explicitly specified in {{uscsub|31|5112|o|3|D|i|II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of her papers are held in the [[Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]], at Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. The archives of the Alice Paul Institute include papers and items from Paul's family history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/collection/alice-paul|title=Alice Paul|date=2016-04-12|work=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2016, President Barack Obama designated Sewall-Belmont House as the [[Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument]], named for Alice Paul and [[Alva Belmont]].&lt;ref name=hirschfeldnew&gt;{{cite news|last=Hirschfeld|first=Julie|title=House With Long Activist History Is Now Monument to Equality|work=The New York Times|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 13, 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/us/politics/obama-womens-equality-national-monument.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eilperinnew&gt;{{cite news|last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|title=A new memorial to tell 'the story of a century of courageous activism by American women'|work=The Washington Post|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/11/obama-to-designate-a-national-monument-in-d-c-to-honor-womens-equality-tuesday/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20160413_White_House_honors_Alice_Paul_s_Washington_headquarters.html|first=Jan|last=Hefler|title=White House honors Alice Paul's Washington headquarters|date=April 14, 2016|work=Philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] announced in 2016 that an image of Alice Paul will appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and the [[1913 Woman Suffrage Procession]] that Paul initiated and organized. Designs for the new $5, $10, and $20 bills will be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote via the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0436.aspx |title= Treasury Secretary Lew Announces Front of New $20 to Feature Harriet Tubman, Lays Out Plans for New $20, $10 and $5 |date=April 20, 2016| publisher=Dept. of the Treasury |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Alice Paul was a central character in an episode of ''[[Timeless (TV series)|Timeless]]'' (Season 2, Episode 7&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Aarniokoski|first=Douglas|title=Mrs. Sherlock Holmes|date=2018-04-29|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6885540/|others=Abigail Spencer, Matt Lanter, Malcolm Barrett|accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which alludes to Paul giving an impassioned speech to President Woodrow Wilson during a march that ends in police violence upon the suffragist marchers. According to history, Paul was at the event, and was arrested, but there is no evidence that she spoke to Wilson on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/elementary-lesson-womens-suffrage-timeless-season-2-episode-7-recapped-180968915/|title=An Elementary Lesson in Women's Suffrage: 'Timeless' Season 2, Episode 7, Recapped|last=Kaufman|first=Rachel|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashoka's Hell''' was, according to legend, an elaborate [[torture chamber]] disguised as a beautiful palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and decorated with flowers,  fruit trees and  ornaments. It was built by Emperor [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) in [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]], [[India]]), the capital city of the [[Maurya Empire]]. The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', the text that describes Emperor Ashoka's life through both legendary and historical accounts.

According to legend, the palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make its exterior visually pleasing and was referred to as the "beautiful gaol". Beneath the veneer of beauty, however, deep inside the  exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of sadistic and cruel instruments of [[torture]] including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on prisoners.

The narrative mentions that the architect of the chamber was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the [[Buddhist hell]] for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims. The text of the ''Ashokavadana'', describes how the torture chamber was so terrifying, it caused people to believe that Ashoka had visited hell itself in his quest to perfect its evil design. Through a pact made between Ashoka and the official executioner of the torture chamber anyone entering the palace, even by chance as a visitor, was not allowed to come out alive.

==Background==
According to the narrations of ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Emperor [[Ashoka]], prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as ''Ashoka the Fierce'', or Chandashoka (Ashoka the Cruel),&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23243-3|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sent his minions on a quest to find a vicious man to work as his official executioner.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

After some searching, Ashoka's men found a suitable candidate by the name of Girika who was so vicious that he killed his own parents because they did not want him to become Ashoka's executioner. Girika was introduced to Ashoka who soon appointed him as the official executioner of  his Empire.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

==Design==
According to legend, Girika persuaded Ashoka to design the torture chamber based on the suffering endured by people reborn in [[Buddhist hell]].&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Amoral Politics: The Persistent Truth of Machiavellism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibkxwtmP7_UC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1886-5|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ashokavadana'' documents a long list of torture acts Girika designed and planned to force upon his prisoners including "prying  open their mouths with an iron and pouring boiling copper down their throats".&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt; Innocent persons were not exempt from such treatment.&lt;ref name="Alahakōn1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hekṭar Alahakōn|title=The Later Mauryas: 232 BC to 180 BC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gR4dAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1980|publisher=Munshiram Manoharla|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative of ''Ashokavadana'', Ashoka asked Girika to disguise the torture chamber as a beautiful and "enticing" palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and to decorate it with flowers, fruit trees and many ornaments. The palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it, and even attract them to enter, and was  referred to as the "beautiful gaol".&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurugé1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda W.

According to the mythology, beneath the veneer of beauty, inside the exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on the prisoners.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mishi Saran|author2=Mishi|title=Chasing the Monk's Shadow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkOBNbnOGYC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306439-8|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thapar1973"/&gt;

In the narrative, Ashoka made a pact with Girika that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt; The torture chamber was so terrifying, that Emperor Ashoka was thought to have visited [[hell]] so that he could perfect its evil design.&lt;ref name="Vittachi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nury Vittachi|title=The Kama Sutra of Business: Management Principles from Indian Classics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK5CBu0UBygC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=13 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82223-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Biographical Sutra of Emperor Ashoka'' the palace is described by the sentence: 'Emperor Ashoka constructed a hell'.&lt;ref name="Brazier2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Brazier|title=The New Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-zNSbmOjVIC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29518-9|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ashokavadana'' refers to Girika as Chandagirika or Girika the Cruel. It appears that Girika overheard a Buddhist monk recite the ''Balapanditasutta'' which contains vivid descriptions of the five tortures of hell, such as:&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt; {{quotation|Finally, there are beings who are reborn in hell whom the hell-guardians grab, and stretch out on their backs on a fiery floor of red-hot iron that is but a mass of flames. Then they carry out the torture of the five-fold tether; they drive two iron stakes through their hands; they drive  two iron stakes through their feet; and  they drive one iron stake through their heart. Truly, O monks, hell is a place of great suffering}} and got his ideas of how to torture prisoners from there. The text describes Girika's attitude toward punishment as follows: "Such are the five great agonies, Girika reflected, and he began to inflict these same tortures on people in his prison". In addition the ''Balapanditasutta'' compares the King's torture methods to the tortures of hell.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt;

==Miracles in the chamber==
The ''Ashokavadana'' further mentions that sometime later a Buddhist monk by the name of [[Samudra]] happened to visit the palace and upon entering he was informed by Girika that he would be tortured to death,&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of King Ashoka: A Study and Translation of the Ashokavadana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp9uaQTQ8h8C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0616-0|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConferenceSharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Indian Society for Buddhist Studies.

His torturers however failed to injure him and he appeared able to neutralise their torture methods by realising that the suffering of the other prisoners is part of the  Buddhist dogma of suffering and attaining [[arhatship]].&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

A particular narration detailed how Samudra, while tortured in a cauldron full of boiling water, human blood, [[bone marrow]] and excrement, caused the contents of the cauldron to cool down and then sat meditating cross-legged on a [[Nelumbo|lotus]] sprouting from the fluid.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

The narrative further describes that when Ashoka heard of these miracles, he was overcome with curiosity and decided to enter the chamber to verify for himself the veracity of the stories. After arriving there he witnessed Samudra levitating with half his body on fire and the other half raining water.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;  Intrigued he asked Samudra to identify himself.&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

Samudra replied that he was a disciple of Buddha and adherent to the [[Dharma]]. Samudra then chastised Ashoka for having built the torture chamber and further instructed him to build eighty four thousand [[stupas]] according to Buddha's prophecy, and to guarantee the security of all beings. To those demands, Ashoka acquiesced. Further he confessed to his crimes and accepted Buddha and the [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DockettDudley-Grant2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen H.

==Demolition==
The ''Ashokavadana'' describes the events leading to the demolition of Ashoka's torture chamber. According to the text, the torture chamber had become the site and the reason of his conversion to Buddhism. Girika, as the resident executioner of the chamber, however, reminded Ashoka of his pledge to kill anyone entering the chamber including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

Ashoka then questioned Girika as to who entered the torture palace first during their visit to see Samudra's miracles. Girika was then forced to admit that it was he who entered first. Upon the executioner's  confession, Ashoka ordered him burnt alive and also ordered the demolition of the torture palace. According to the ''Ashokavadana'', "the beautiful jail was then torn down and a guarantee of security was extended to all beings".&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

From that point on,  Ashoka became known as ''Ashoka the Pious''.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Rich|title=To Uphold the World: A Call for a New Global Ethic from Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9ZoeR3r7ngC&amp;pg=PT147|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 March 2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-9553-9|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History Of Ancient And Early Medieval India: From The Stone Age To The 12Th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA332|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] in his writings mentions that in the 7th century AD he had visited the place where Ashoka's  torture chamber once was and that it was, even at that time, referred to in Hindu tradition as "Ashoka's Hell".&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant2011"/&gt; Xuanzang also claimed that he saw the column identifying the location of Ashoka's Hell.&lt;ref name="Thapar1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Romila Thapar|title=Aśoka and the Decline of the Mauryas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ntDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ashoka+hell+on+earth&amp;dq=ashoka+hell+on+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=scl0UYO8E4WR0QG0vIFA&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=29|quote=Fa-hsien repeats the story and explains that Ashoka personally visited the infernal regions and studied their methods of torture before inventing his own.1 Hsiian Tsang claims to have actually seen the pillar marking the site of Ashoka's 'Hell'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], the palace is known as "Ashoka's Hell" and its location near [[Pataliputra]] became a popular destination for pilgrims. In the 5th century, AD [[Faxian]], who was also a Buddhist monk, also reports visiting it and his account of the story of the palace differs slightly from that of Xuanzang's.&lt;ref name="Durant2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Will Durant|title=Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ru4LPyMAxxkC&amp;pg=PT707|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=7 June 2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-4668-9|pages=707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchlagerLauer2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil Schlager|author2=Josh Lauer|title=Science and its times: understanding the social significance of scientific discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYU-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-7876-3933-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, British explorer [[Laurence Waddell]],  while in [[Patna]], established that [[Agam Kuan]], which means the "unfathomable well", was part of Ashoka's Hell as reported also by the two Chinese  monks.&lt;ref name=doa&gt;{{cite web |title=Agam Kuan |url=http://yac.bih.nic.in/Da-01.htm#AgamKuan |publisher=Directorate of Archaeology, Govt. of Bihar, official website |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Material Life of Northern India: Based on an Archaeological Study, 3rd Century B.C. to 1st Century B.C.|author= Asha Vishnu|publisher=Mittal Publications |year=1993|isbn=8170994101 |page=173 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaJ5oyrqBakC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Agam+Kuan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m7FwUYvUBIarrAebvICABg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Agam%20Kuan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India Perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|title=India Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqqyAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=2003|publisher=PTI for the Ministry of External Affairs|page=13|quote=A little distance away is another Ashokan remain, the Agam Kuan or the fathomless well which is believed to be a part of the legendary hell created by ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KuraishiIndia1931"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mohammad Hamid Kuraishi|author2=Archaeological Survey of India|title=List of ancient monuments protected under Act VII of 1904 in the province of Bihar and Orissa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOwLfHIYK8gC&amp;q=Agam+Kuan+hell&amp;dq=Agam+Kuan+hell&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ScB1Udb8JZOP0QHZq4GICg&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1931|publisher=Govt. of India, Central Publication Branch|page=96|quote=Waddell, the Agam Kuan " seems to be a vestige of Ashoka's hell,...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">From 2004-2014, the '''Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project''' annually rated the level of government respect for a variety of internationally recognized human rights. The final CIRI data set contains quantitative indicators of 15 human rights for 195 countries, annually from 1981-2011. The CIRI data were used in over 170 countries by scholars, students, policymakers, and analysts representing over 400 organizations. CIRI's founders and co-directors were political scientists Dr. [[David Cingranelli]] at [[Binghamton University]], SUNY &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/political-science/faculty/david-cingranelli.html David L.

==Accessing the data==

The CIRI data were free for not-for-profit users. Once registered, CIRI users could create customized datsets, choosing only the indicators, countries, and years they needed; or, they could download the entire data set. As of December 2007, CIRI began using its own numeric country identifier code, but continued to offer others for the purpose of data merging. The MyCIRI feature allowed users to store their datasets on the CIRI server and easily update them when the master CIRI data was updated.

==Financial support==

Financial support for the CIRI Data Project came from the United States' [[National Science Foundation]];&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation Grant Nos. SBR-9730130 (1997-1998), SES-0318273 (2004-2006), SES-0647969 (2007-2010), and SES-0647916 (2007-2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Bank]]; [[GTZ]]; [[Binghamton University]], SUNY; the Center on Democratic Performance at Binghamton University, SUNY; The Human Rights Institute and College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences at [[The University of Connecticut]].

==CIRI human rights indicators==

The CIRI database coded only human rights PRACTICES of governments. The human rights for which government levels of respect were annually rated by CIRI included:

* Assembly &amp; Association
* Disappearance
* Domestic Movement
* Electoral Self-Determination (formerly Political Participation &amp; Free and Fair Elections)
* Empowerment Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for electoral self-determination, domestic movement, foreign movement, religion, speech, assembly &amp; association, and workers' rights)
* Extrajudicial Killing
* Foreign Movement
* Independence of the Judiciary
* Physical Integrity Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for disappearance, extrajudicial killing, political imprisonment, and torture)
* Political Imprisonment
* Religion
* Speech
* Torture
* Women's Economic Rights
* Women's Political Rights
* Women's Social Rights
* Workers' Rights

Most of the CIRI indicators were ratings (as opposed to rankings) on a scale of 0-2 for their respect of human rights, as follows:

*0= Frequent violations of this right
*1= Some violations of this right
*2= No reported violations of this right

The CIRI database used the annual country reports from the US State Department and Amnesty International as its primary sources.

'''Karoly Hajdu''' (1920–1981), better-known as '''Charlotte Bach''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-British [[impostor]] who later in life became a [[trans woman]] and [[fringe science|fringe]] [[evolution]]ary theorist. She developed an alternative theory of evolution which acquired a cult following among prominent writers and scientists in the London of the 1970s. They, without exception, remained ignorant of her true identity until after her death.

==Life as a man==
Hajdu was born near [[Budapest]] in 1920. In the wake of [[World War II]] he moved to England and in 1948 began to use the name Baron '''Carl Hajdu'''. In 1956 he collected money for [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian freedom fighters]] resisting the then [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation. ''[[Sunday People|The People]]'', which specialised in lurid [[exposé (journalism)|exposés]], alleged that Hajdu had pocketed the proceeds. He was found guilty of [[fraud]] in 1957, and was forced into [[bankruptcy]].

Hajdu then adopted the persona of writer and society [[hypnotherapist]] '''Michel Karoly'''. He rented an apartment in [[Mayfair]]. He began to acquire a following in polite society, and wrote an [[agony aunt|agony uncle]] column in a mass-selling magazine of the day. Karoly continued in this role until 1965, when both his wife and stepson suddenly died. He was declared bankrupt again, and in 1966 was sentenced to two months in [[Prison|gaol]] for acquiring a loan whilst bankrupt.

By her own account, the sudden deaths had precipitated a profound identity crisis.

==Life as a woman==
In 1968, Hajdu adopted the new identity of Dr Charlotte Bach, a supposed former lecturer at Budapest's [[Eötvös Loránd University]], whose alumni included the philosophers [[Michael Polanyi|Michael]] and [[Karl Polanyi]] and the mathematician [[John von Neumann]].

'Dr Bach' would openly tell lecture audiences how at first, putting ads in the windows of local newsagents, she had worked as a [[dominatrix]]. This experience had provided invaluable research data, she said, for the purpose of compiling a dictionary of psychology. These researches had in turn led to the all-embracing theory.

She lived full-time as Charlotte Bach until she died. She was thus what is sometimes referred to as a ''non-op trans woman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|periodical=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|volume=2|date=1999-10-10|author=Dr. Charles Moser|url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume2/Moser/moser1.htm|accessdate=2009-01-26|title=Addressing the Healthcare Needs of Sexual Minority Patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ethology===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nikolass Tinbergen.gif|thumb|left|120px|[[Niko Tinbergen]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Dutch [[ethology|ethologist]] whose ideas were a key influence on Bach's [[pseudo-science]] of human ethology]] --&gt;
In 1971 Bach unveiled her transformative, as she would insist, theory of [[evolution]]. Among other things, she argued, it correctly displaced [[Darwinism]] in favour of [[Lamarckism]]. Drawing heavily on the work of animal [[ethology|ethologists]] such as [[Niko Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]], she argued that humans experience in varying degrees a pull towards becoming the opposite [[gender|sex]]. This urge could either be denied or ''asseverated'': [[gay]]s and femme [[lesbians]], for example, are [[female|women]] in men’s bodies or vice versa, but transvestites and butch lesbians are not. This gave rise to eight possible permutations.

This deep-seated and ineradicable phenomenon, she argued, was the true engine of evolutionary change. It was also the key to the proper understanding of culture&amp;mdash;including science, politics and religion. Upon such reasoning, backed up by a polymathic accumulation of supporting evidence and a forceful lecturing style, she elaborated what she called the science of Human Ethology.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hollylodgeestatelondon.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Holly Lodge, where only the caretaker knew Bach's true identity]] --&gt;
Eminent scientists who sought to engage with the apparent challenges of Bach's theory included the [[biologist]] [[Brian Goodwin]] and [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]], a pioneer of [[cybernetics]] and former head of the [[Burden Neurological Institute]] in Bristol.

Bach attracted the interest in particular of the English writer [[Colin Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=The Misfits|year=1988|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-88184-589-2|pages=15–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of a number of eminent British scientists and academics. Wilson began to write about her theory. Bach became a cult figure. A small group of followers who would gather at her home at [[Holly Lodge Estate|Holly Lodge]] in [[Highgate]], while weekly lectures would take place elsewhere. An Institute of Human Ethology was set up to promote her ideas and stimulate further research. Her literary executors included the then professor of educational technology at Britain's [[Open University]]. She was invited to speak at [[Sussex University]] and at [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], [[Cambridge]], named in honour of the man most of whose ideas she wished to consign to the dustbin.

In due course, leading members of London's then burgeoning [[Gay Liberation]] movement&amp;mdash;equally ignorant of Bach's true identity&amp;mdash;took up human ethology and started publishing pamphlets of their own, much attracted by the tantalising notion of homosexuals as the [[vanguardism|vanguard]] of evolutionary change.

Bach continued to elaborate upon her original thesis up to the time of her death in 1981.

A '''color model''' is an abstract mathematical model describing the way [[color]]s can be represented as [[tuple]]s of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called "[[color space]]." This section describes ways in which human [[color vision]] can be modeled.

== Tristimulus color space ==

[[File:gamut full.png|thumb|right|3D representation of the human color space.]]

One can picture this space as a region in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] if one identifies the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes with the stimuli for the long-wavelength (''L''), medium-wavelength (''M''), and short-wavelength (''S'') [[Cone cell|light receptors]]. The origin, (''S'',''M'',''L'') = (0,0,0), corresponds to black.  White has no definite position in this diagram; rather it is defined according to the [[color temperature]] or white balance as desired or as available from ambient lighting. The human color space is a horse-shoe-shaped cone such as shown here (see also [[Color_models#CIE_XYZ_color_space|CIE chromaticity diagram]] below), extending from the origin to, in principle, infinity. In practice, the human color receptors will be saturated or even be damaged at extremely high light intensities, but such behavior is not part of the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] color space and neither is the changing color perception at low light levels (see: [[Kruithof curve]]). 
The most saturated colors are located at the outer rim of the region, with brighter colors farther removed from the origin. As far as the responses of the receptors in the eye are concerned, there is no such thing as "brown" or "gray" light. The latter color names refer to orange and white light respectively, with an intensity that is lower than the light from surrounding areas. One can observe this by watching the screen of an [[overhead projector]] during a meeting: one sees black lettering on a white background, even though the "black" has in fact not become darker than the white screen on which it is projected before the projector was turned on.  The "black" areas have not actually become darker but appear "black" relative to the higher intensity "white" projected onto the screen around it. See also [[color constancy]].

The human tristimulus space has the property that additive mixing of colors corresponds to the adding of vectors in this space. This makes it easy to, for example, describe the possible colors ([[gamut]]) that can be constructed from the red, green, and blue primaries in a computer display.

== CIE XYZ color space ==
{{main article|CIE 1931 color space}}
[[Image:CIE 1931 XYZ Color Matching Functions.svg|thumb|325px|right|[http://www.cie.co.at/framepublications.html CIE] 1931 Standard Colorimetric Observer functions between 380 nm and 780 nm (at 5 nm intervals).]]

One of the first mathematically defined color spaces is the CIE XYZ color space (also known as CIE 1931 color space), created by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] in 1931. These data were measured for human observers and a 2-degree field of view. In 1964, supplemental data for a 10-degree field of view were published.

Note that the tabulated sensitivity curves have a certain amount of arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall [[luminosity function]] (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrarily chosen to produce equal areas under the curves. One could as well define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 xyz color space are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.

Sometimes XYZ colors are represented by the luminance, Y, and chromaticity coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X}{X + Y + Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{Y}{X + Y + Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, ''x'' and ''y'' are projective coordinates and the colors of the chromaticity diagram occupy a region of the [[projective plane|real projective plane]]. Because the CIE sensitivity curves have equal areas under the curves, light with a flat energy spectrum corresponds to the point (''x'',''y'') = (0.333,0.333).

The values for ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are obtained by integrating the product of the spectrum of a light beam and the published color-matching functions.

==Additive and subtractive color models==

=== RGB color model ===

{{main|RGB color model}}
[[File:RGBCube a.svg|179px|thumb]]

Media that transmit light (such as television) use [[additive color]] mixing with [[primary color]]s of [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]], each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors with as little stimulation as possible of the other two. This is called "[[RGB]]" color space. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space and thus produce a large part of human color experiences. This is why [[color television]] sets or color computer monitors need only produce mixtures of red, green and blue light. See [[Additive color]].

Other primary colors could in principle be used, but with red, green and blue the largest portion of the [[human color space]] can be captured. Unfortunately there is no exact consensus as to what loci in the [[chromaticity diagram]] the red, green, and blue colors should have, so the same RGB values can give rise to slightly different colors on different screens.

=== CMYK color model ===

{{main|CMYK color model}}

It is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by combining [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] transparent dyes/inks on a white substrate. These are the ''[[subtractive color|subtractive]]'' [[primary color]]s. Often a fourth ink, [[black]], is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This is called the "CMY" or "CMYK" color space.

The cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue, the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue, and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green. The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer. Because in practice the CMY inks suitable for printing also reflect a little bit of color, making a deep and neutral black impossible, the K (black ink) component, usually printed last, is needed to compensate for their deficiencies. Use of a separate black ink is also economically driven when a lot of black content is expected, e.g. in text media, to reduce simultaneous use of the three colored inks. The dyes used in traditional color photographic prints and [[reversal film|slides]] are much more perfectly transparent, so a K component is normally not needed or used in those media.

==Cylindrical-coordinate color models==
A number of color models exist in which colors are fit into [[conic]], [[cylindrical]] or [[spherical]] shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues corresponding to angles around that axis. Arrangements of this type date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models.

{{see also|Color solid}}
Different color theorists have each designed unique [[color solid]]s.  Many are in the shape of a [[sphere]], whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures&amp;mdash;these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly.  The color spheres conceived by [[Phillip Otto Runge]] and [[Johannes Itten]] are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Itten, "The Art of Color", 1961. Trans. Ernst Van Haagen. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966. {{ISBN|0-442-24038-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical, and form the basis for the description below.

Pure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere.  As in the color wheel, [[Complementary color |contrasting (or complementary) hues]] are located opposite each other.  Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central [[Coordinate axis|axis]] as a neutral [[gray]].  Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black.  

The vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from [[black]] at the bottom to [[white]] at the top.  All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere.  All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.

===HSL and HSV===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}
{{multiple image

 | image1  = tint-tone-shade.svg
 | caption1 = Painters long mixed colors by combining relatively bright pigments with black and white.

 | alt1   =
 | image2  = RGB Cube Show lowgamma cutout b.png
 | caption2 = The RGB gamut can be arranged in a cube. The RGB model is not very intuitive to artists used to using traditional models based on tints, shades and tones. The HSL and HSV color models were designed to fix this.

HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the [[red]] [[primary color|primary]] at 0°, passing through the [[green]] primary at 120° and the [[blue]] primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the ''neutral'', ''achromatic'', or ''gray'' colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.

Most televisions, computer displays, and projectors produce colors by combining red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[additive color|additive]] [[primary color]]s. However, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with [[subtractive color]] mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades.

In an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models, computer graphics pioneers at [[PARC (company)|PARC]] and [[New York Institute of Technology|NYIT]] developed{{explain|date=June 2018}} the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by [[Alvy Ray Smith]]&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[[#Smith|Smith (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the August 1978 issue of [[Computer Graphics (publication)|''Computer Graphics'']]. In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg&lt;ref name=Joblove&gt;[[#Joblove|Joblove and Greenberg (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt; described the HSL model—whose dimensions they labeled ''hue'', ''relative chroma'', and ''intensity''—and compared it to HSV. Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in [[color vision|human vision]] in terms of other color-making attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon traditional color mixing methods—e.g., in painting—that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.

The following year, 1979, at [[SIGGRAPH]], [[Tektronix]] introduced graphics terminals using HSL for color designation, and the Computer Graphics Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report. These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then.

===Munsell color system===

}}
{{main|Munsell color system}}
Another influential older cylindrical color model is the early-20th-century [[Munsell color system]]. [[Albert Henry Munsell|Albert Munsell]] began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book ''A Color Notation'', but he wished to properly separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called ''hue'', ''value'', and ''chroma'', and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses, he realized that no symmetrical shape would do, so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Runge |first1=Phillipp Otto |author-link=Philipp Otto Runge |date=1810 |title=Die Farben-Kugel, oder Construction des Verhaeltnisses aller Farben zueinander |location=Hamburg, Germany |publisher=Perthes |language=German |trans-title=The Color Sphere, or Construction of the Relationship of All Colors to Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Henry Munsell]] (1905). ''A Color Notation''. Boston, MA: [[Munsell Color Company]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=upper-alpha |See also [[#Fairchild|Fairchild (2005)]], and [[Munsell Color System]] and its references.}}

Munsell’s system became extremely popular, the de facto reference for American color standards—used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons, but also, e.g., electrical wire, beer, and soil color—because it was organized based on perceptual measurements, specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers, because the color chips sold in the ''Munsell Book of Color'' covered a wide [[gamut]] and remained stable over time (rather than fading), and because it was effectively marketed by [[Munsell Color Company|Munsell’s Company]]. In the 1940s, the [[Optical Society of America]] made extensive measurements, and adjusted the arrangement of Munsell colors, issuing a set of "renotations". The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations, but only via its foundational measurements: effectively a [[lookup table]]. Converting from {{nobr|RGB ↔ Munsell}} requires interpolating between that table’s entries, and is extremely computationally expensive in comparison with converting from {{nobr|RGB ↔ HSL}} or {{nobr|RGB ↔ HSV}} which only requires a few simple arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name=Fairchild&gt;[[#Fairchild|Fairchild (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edward |last1=Landa |first2=Mark |last2=Fairchild |date=September–October 2005 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/charting-color-from-the-eye-of-the-beholder/5 |title=Charting Color from the Eye of the Beholder |journal=American Scientist |volume=93 |issue=5 |page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dorothy Nickerson |year=1976|title=History of the Munsell Color System|journal=Color Research and Application|volume=1|pages=121–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sidney Newhall |author2=Dorothy Nickerson |author3=Deane Judd |doi=10.1364/JOSA.33.000385|title=Final Report of the OSA Subcommittee on the Spacing of the Munsell Colors|year=1943|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|volume=33|issue=7|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preucil hue circle===
In [[densitometry]], a model quite similar to the hue defined above is used for describing colors of [[CMYK color model|CMYK process]] inks. In 1953, Frank Preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue, the "Preucil hue circle" and the "Preucil hue hexagon", analogous to our ''H'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, but defined relative to idealized cyan, yellow, and magenta ink colors. The "Preucil ''hue error''" of an ink indicates the difference in the "hue circle" between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color. The ''grayness'' of an ink is {{nobr|''m''/''M''}}, where ''m'' and ''M'' are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan, magenta, and yellow in a density measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Preucil (1953). "Color Hue and Ink Transfer—Their Relation to Perfect Reproduction". ''Proceedings of the 5th Annual Technical Meeting of TAGA''. {{nobr|pp. 102–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural Color System===
The Swedish [[Natural Color System]] (NCS), widely used in Europe, takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bicone at right. Because it attempts to fit color into a familiarly shaped solid based on "[[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]]" instead of photometric or psychological characteristics, it suffers from some of the same disadvantages as HSL and HSV: in particular, its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness, because it forces colorful yellow, red, green, and blue into a plane.&lt;ref name=MacEvoy&gt;[[#MacEvoy|MacEvoy (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIELCH&lt;sub&gt;uv&lt;/sub&gt; and CIELCH&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;===

The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) developed the [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ model]] for describing the colors of light spectra in 1931, but its goal was to match human visual [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]], rather than to be perceptually uniform, geometrically. In the 1960s and 70s, attempts were made to transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry, influenced by the Munsell system. These efforts culminated in the 1976 [[CIELUV]] and [[CIELAB]] models. The dimensions of these models—{{nobr|(''L''*, ''u''*, ''v''*)}} and {{nobr|(''L''*, ''a''*, ''b''*)}}, respectively—are cartesian, based on the [[opponent process]] theory of color, but both are also often described using polar coordinates—{{nobr|(''L''*, ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nobr|(''L''*, ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, respectively—where ''L''* is lightness, ''C''* is chroma, and ''h''* is hue angle. Officially, both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their [[color difference]] metrics ∆''E''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆''E''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly for use defining color tolerances, but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models, including in computer graphics and computer vision. For example, [[gamut mapping]] in [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] [[color management]] is usually performed in CIELAB space, and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images. CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as RGB, HSL, HSV, YUV/YIQ/YCbCr or XYZ, but are not perceptually perfect, and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions.&lt;ref name=Fairchild/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuehni&gt;[[#Kuehni|Kuehni (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunt (2004).

The [[HCL color space]] seems to be synonymous with CIELCH.

===CIECAM02===
The CIE’s most recent model, [[CIECAM02]] (CAM stands for "color appearance model"), is more theoretically sophisticated and computationally complex than earlier models. Its aims are to fix several of the problems with models such as CIELAB and CIELUV, and to explain not only responses in carefully controlled experimental environments, but also to model the color appearance of real-world scenes. Its dimensions ''J'' (lightness), ''C'' (chroma), and ''h'' (hue) define a polar-coordinate geometry.&lt;ref name=Fairchild/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacEvoy/&gt;

== Color systems ==

There are various types of color systems that classify color and analyse their effects. The American [[Munsell color system]] devised by [[Albert Henry Munsell|Albert H. Munsell]] is a famous classification that organises various colors into a color solid based on hue, saturation and value. Other important color systems include the Swedish [[Natural Color System]] (NCS), the [[Optical Society of America]]'s [[Uniform Color Space]] (OSA-UCS), and the Hungarian [[Coloroid]] system developed by [[Antal Nemcsics]] from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]. Of those, the NCS is based on the [[opponent process|opponent-process]] color model, while the Munsell, the OSA-UCS and the Coloroid attempt to model color uniformity. The American [[Pantone]] and the German [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] commercial color-matching systems differ from the previous ones in that their color spaces are not based on an underlying color model.

== Other uses of "color model" ==
=== Models of mechanism of color vision ===

We also use "color model" to indicate a model or mechanism of color vision for explaining how color signals are processed from visual cones to ganglion cells.  For simplicity, we call these models color mechanism models. The classical color mechanism models are [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]–[[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]'s [[Young–Helmholtz theory|trichromatic model]] and [[Ewald Hering|Hering]]'s [[opponent process|opponent-process model]]. Though these two theories were initially thought to be at odds, it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for color opponency receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level.&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;Kandel ER, Schwartz JH and Jessell TM, 2000. ''Principles of Neural Science'', 4th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York. pp.&amp;nbsp;577–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebrate evolution of color vision ===

{{main|Evolution of color vision}}

Vertebrate animals were primitively [[tetrachromatic]]. They possessed four types of cones—long, mid, short wavelength cones, and ultraviolet sensitive cones.  Today, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds are all tetrachromatic. Placental mammals lost both the mid and short wavelength cones. Thus, most mammals do not have complex color vision—they are [[dichromacy|dichromatic]] but they are sensitive to ultraviolet light, though they cannot see its colors. Human trichromatic color vision is a recent evolutionary novelty that first evolved in the common ancestor of the Old World Primates. Our trichromatic color vision evolved by duplication of the long wavelength sensitive [[opsin]], found on the X chromosome. One of these copies evolved to be sensitive to green light and constitutes our mid wavelength opsin. At the same time, our short wavelength opsin evolved from the ultraviolet opsin of our vertebrate and mammalian ancestors.

Human [[red-green color blindness]] occurs because the two copies of the red and green opsin genes remain in close proximity on the X chromosome. Because of frequent recombination during meiosis, these gene pairs can get easily rearranged, creating versions of the genes that do not have distinct spectral sensitivities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3262">The '''''corporate opportunity''''' doctrine is the legal principle providing that [[board of directors|directors]], officers, and controlling shareholders of a [[corporation]] must not take for themselves any business opportunity that could benefit the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;18B Am. Jur. 2d ''Corporations'' § 1536 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;  The corporate opportunity doctrine is one application of the [[fiduciary]] [[duty of loyalty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Application ==
The corporate opportunity doctrine does not apply to all fiduciaries of a corporation; rather, it is limited to directors, officers, and controlling shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine applies regardless of whether the corporation is harmed by the transaction; indeed, it applies even if the corporation benefits from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1538.&lt;/ref&gt;  The corporate opportunity doctrine only applies if the opportunity was not disclosed to the corporation.  If the opportunity was disclosed to the board of directors and the board declined to take the opportunity for the corporation, the fiduciary may take the opportunity for him- or herself.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1539.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the corporate opportunity doctrine applies, the corporation is entitled to all profits earned by the fiduciary from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1538, 1540.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the leading [[English law]] case of {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]|year=1942|court=UKHL|num=1}} it was held that "The rule of equity which insists on those who by use of a fiduciary position make a profit, being liable to account for that profit, in no way depends on fraud, or absence of ''[[bona fide]]s'' ... or whether the plaintiff has in fact been damaged or benefited by his action."

== Elements ==
A business opportunity is a corporate opportunity if the corporation is financially able to undertake the opportunity, the opportunity is within the corporation's line of business, and the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1536.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] has stated, "An opportunity is within a corporation's line of business . . . if it is an activity as to which the corporation has fundamental knowledge, practical experience and ability to pursue."&lt;ref&gt;''Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. v. Stewart'', 833 A.2d 961, 972-73 (Del. Ch. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''In re eBay, Inc. Shareholders Litigation'', investing in various [[securities]] was held to be in a line of business of eBay despite the fact that eBay's primary purpose is to provide an online auction platform.&lt;ref&gt;''In re eBay, Inc. S'holders Litig.'', 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 4 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Investing was in a line of business of eBay because eBay "consistently invested a portion of its cash on hand in marketable securities."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at *12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A corporation has an interest or expectancy in a business opportunity if the opportunity would further an established business policy of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;18B Am. Jur. 2d ''Corporations'' § 1542 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counterword''' (also spelled '''counter word''' and '''counter-word''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsmyth.net/?level=3&amp;ent=counterword+|title=Wordsmyth Dictionary|website=wordsmyth.net}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/counterword?r=66|title=the definition of counterword|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a word such as ''"so"'' that is frequently used to answer ("counter") in a reflex-like manner and that has due to this frequent use quickly taken on a new, much less specific or much looser meaning or is even almost meaningless or performs a completely new function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/counterword|title=Meaning of counterword |website=InfoPlease}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/counterword|title=Counterword definition and meaning |website=Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "so", for example, is frequently used to begin an answer in the sense of "Well,..." or to function as an indirect way of saying "Before answering that, I'd like to..." or even instead of saying "On the contrary,..." or "No, I...".

In a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/counterword+|title=Definition of COUNTERWORD|website=i.word.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers. Other examples include ''nice'', ''terrific'', ''terrible'', ''awful'', ''tremendous'', ''swell'', ''hopefully'' and ''very fine'' (degrading the meaning of ''fine'' to "OK").

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not support this and defines counter-word as "countersign", noting that its usage is military and obsolete with a single quotation from 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43064?redirectedFrom=counterword#eid "counter-word"], ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

[[File:White-tailed_deer.jpg|thumb|350px|Due to the deer's prevalence across different types of terrain, importance as a game animal and free and unrestricted nature the animal is a popular component of country symbolism.]]

'''Country''', as an [[Self-concept| identity]] or descriptive quality, is the state or character of being rural regardless of environment. It can be at direct odds with  quantitative measures of ruralness such as [[Rural area| those used by governments for statistical analysis]]. Country is [[Subjectivity| subjective]] and often [[intuitive]]. It encompasses a broad base of ideas and perceptions that may differ at local, regional or national levels. The term country can be used to refer to individuals both in singular and plural, while the term '''countryfolk''' is exclusively used collectively.

==Social development==
Identity has the tendency to be more localized within relatively isolated populations. Such populations, having distinct traditions of their own, can often be viewed as an [[Ingroups_and_outgroups| outgroup]] and marginalized by the dominant culture. Accordingly, contrast between rural and urban realities not only produces measurable differences politically and economically, but also affects populations in terms of social identification.&lt;ref name="knowingyourplace"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country conceptualization shifts the focus away from the prevailing forces in society (usually centered in larger, metropolitan regions) and towards those on the periphery of society (remote areas and small towns). Consequently, this transition causes rural populations to feel less ignored, better connected with rural [[diaspora]] and significantly more empowered. By extension this transition highlights that rural culture is pervasive and does not necessarily depend on residing in a rural area. As a result country conceptualization  often assists in reversing the psychological consequences of frequent marginalization.
[[File:Town_mouse_country_mouse.png|left|{{largethumb}}|An illustration of [[The_Town_Mouse_and_the_Country_Mouse| "The Town Mouse and Country Mouse"]] of  ''Aesop's Fables'' an early parable of urban and rural equality/divide.]]
==Cognitive definitions== 
Country is a [[Subjectively| subjective state]] that perceives the [[rural area| rural]] [[experience]] as focal and inseparable to ones [[collective identity| identity]], regardless of location. This is often expressed in the [[social exclusion| demarginalization]] of ideas, values or lifestyles held as being representative of such a character. A concise understanding of Country as an overarching concept is difficult due to the tendency by observers to equate it with frequently  associated elements. As well, by individuals and groups denoting Country with classification that limits in such terms (IE "rural working-class culture" or "southern culture").  However it is perhaps best epitomized not in objective elements, as place, class or [[Natural environment|environment]], but rather in its subjective symbolism and by the perception that individuals can continue to retain a sense of ''ruralness'' even in urbanized areas. As there is no definitive, scholarly consensus on precisely what constitutes as Country, much of its discourse can be attributed to the artistic community who describe it in [[Romanticism| romanticized]] ways. In her master thesis, ''Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National'', Stephanie Schäfer denotes that [[country music]] is important tool for reinforcing this collective identity.
&lt;ref name="schafer"&gt;{{ cite thesis | last=Schäfer | first=Stephanie | authorlink=  | ISBN=978-3-8428-2301-3 | publisher=Diplomica Verlag GmbH | title=Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National | url= | year=2011 | degree=MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Schäfer's analysis of country music as losing much of its "ground" in recent years through commercialization, even modern songs such as ''[[How Country Feels]]'' (Randy Houser), ''[[A Little More Country Than That]]'' (Easton Corbin), ''I'm Country'' (Craig Morgan), ''[[She's Country]]'' (Jason Aldean), etc. continue to, directly or indirectly, address the topic of Country conceptualization.  For example, Luke Bryan in ''[[Doin'_My_Thing| What Country Is]]'' illustrates Country by contrasting it with what it is not. He elaborates that:

{{quotation|"It [Country] ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture,

It's cars pulling over for a no cap tractor,

It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips, 

No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with, 

That's what country is."}}

This emphasis of non-material culture over material resonates with the rural experience as being represented through material elements rather than solely consisting of them.  Within the United States country frequently transcends a close relationship with the [[Culture of the Southern United States]] as a source of unity and empowerment of local, marginalized peoples who feel left out from the dominant culture. The preference to identify as country before more tradition means of classification, such as race or class, is reflected of [[self-determination theory]]. As human beings have an inherent drive to better their association with others they consistently try to do so more effectively. Country identification is one way in that an individual strives for this realization by identifying in ways that are more advantageous to rural populations and not necessarily in ways dictated by mainstream society.

[[File:Daydreaming Gentleman.jpg|thumb|right|Daydreaming gentleman in 1912]]
'''Daydreaming''' is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings, during which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a visionary [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake. 

There are many types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst [[psychologists]], however the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]].&lt;ref name="Klinger"&gt;Klinger, Eric (October 1987). ''[[Psychology Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and the negative vs. positive aspects==
[[File:Helleu - Daydream.jpg|thumb|right|''Daydream'' by [[Paul César Helleu]]]]
Negative aspects of daydreaming were stressed after human work became dictated by the motion of the tool. As [[craft production]] was largely replaced by [[assembly line]] that did not allow for any creativity, no place was left for positive aspects of daydreaming. It not only became associated with laziness, but also with danger.

For example, in the late 19th century, Toni Nelson argued that some daydreams with grandiose fantasies are self-gratifying attempts at "wish fulfillment". Still in the 1950s, some educational [[psychologist]]s warned parents not to let their children daydream, for fear that the children may be sucked into "[[neurosis]] and even [[psychosis]]".&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt;

==Psychological studies==
[[The Interpretation of Dreams|Freudian psychology]] interpreted daydreaming as expression of the repressed instincts similarly to those revealing themselves in nighttime [[dreams]]. Like nighttime dreams, daydreams, also, are an example of wish-fulfilment (based on infantile experiences), and are allowed to surface because of relaxed censorship. He pointed out that, in contrast to nighttime dreams, which are often confusing and incoherent, there seems to be a process of "secondary revision" in fantasies that makes them more lucid, like daydreaming. The state of daydreaming is a kind of liminal state between waking (with the ability to think rationally and logically) and sleeping. They stand in much the same relation to the childhood memories from which they are derived as do some of the Baroque palaces of Rome to the ancient ruins whose pavements and columns have provided the material for the more recent structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=J.|title=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume V (1900-1901): The Interpretation of Dreams (Second Part) and On Dreams.|year=1953|publisher=The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-analysis|location=London|pages=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists Jerome L. Singer of [[Yale University]] and John S. Antrobus of the [[City College of New York]], created a daydream [[questionnaire]]. The questionnaire, called the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI), has been used to investigate daydreams. Psychologists Leonard Giambra and George Huba used the IPI and found that daydreamers' imaginary images vary in three ways: how vivid or enjoyable the daydreams are, how many guilt- or fear-filled daydreams they have, and how "deeply" into the daydream people go.&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt;
 
[[Humanistic psychology]] on other hand, found numerous examples of people in [[creativity|creative]] or artistic careers, such as [[musical composer|composers]], [[novelist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Recent research==
Eric Klinger's research in the 1980s showed that most daydreams are about ordinary, everyday events and help to remind us of mundane tasks. Klinger's research also showed that over 75% of workers in "boring jobs", such as [[lifeguard]]s and [[truck driver]]s, use vivid daydreams to "ease the boredom" of their routine tasks. Klinger found that fewer than 5% of the workers' daydreams involved explicitly sexual thoughts and that violent daydreams were also uncommon.&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt;

Israeli high school students who scored high on the Daydreaming Scale of the IPI had more [[empathy]] than students who scored low. Some psychologists use the mental imagery created during their clients' daydreaming to help gain insight into their mental state and make diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vaitl, J. Gruzelier, D. Lehmann et al., "Psychobiology of Altered States of Consciousness," ''Psychological Bulletin'', vol. 131, no. 1, 2005, pp. 98–127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=The Daydream |title= The Head Trip: Adventures on the Wheel of Consciousness |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-679-31408-0 |first=Jeff |last=Warren |publisher=Random House Canada |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent research has also shown that daydreaming, much like nighttime dreaming, is a time when the brain consolidates learning. Daydreaming may also help people to sort through problems and achieve success. Research with [[fMRI]] shows that brain areas associated with complex problem-solving become activated during daydreaming episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090511180702.htm |title=Brain's Problem-solving Function At Work When We Daydream |date=2009-05-12 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christoff |first=Kalina |author2=Alan M.

Research by Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] has found that people who experience vivid [[dream]]-like [[mental image]]s reserve the word for these, whereas many other people when they talk about "daydreaming" refer to milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of past memories, or just "spacing out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = D.

While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the [[nonprofit sector]], the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit.&lt;ref name="doing-good-better"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=Doing Good Better|date=2015|publisher=Avery|isbn=978-1592409105}}&lt;/ref&gt; People associated with the movement include philosopher [[Peter Singer]],&lt;ref name="blog.ted.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=The why and how of effective altruism: Peter Singer’s talk visualized|url=http://blog.ted.com/why-how-effective-altruism-peter-singer-visualized/|website=TED Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook cofounder [[Dustin Moskovitz]],&lt;ref name="Washington Post on Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/billionaire-couple-give-plenty-to-charity-but-they-do-quite-a-bit-of-homework/2014/12/26/19fae34c-86d6-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html | title=Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz: Young Silicon Valley billionaires pioneer new approach to philanthropy | date=December 26, 2014 | agency=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cari Tuna,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/9/12/meet-cari-tuna-the-woman-giving-away-dustin-moskovitzs-faceb.html|title=Meet Cari Tuna, the Woman Giving Away Dustin Moskovitz's Facebook Fortune|first=Favid|last=Callahan|work=Inside Philanthropy|date=September 12, 2013|access-date=March 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford-based researchers [[William MacAskill]]&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Derek|title=The Greatest Good|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/#b06g25t20w15|work=The Atlantic|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toby Ord]],&lt;ref name="Peter Singer The Most Good You Can Do"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBWWX4ViD3E/|website=YouTube|title=Peter Singer: "The Most Good You Can Do" &amp;#124; Talks at Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professional poker player [[Liv Boeree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokerstrategy.com/news/world-of-poker/Liv-Boeree-on-Effective-Altruism_100487/|title=News: Liv Boeree on Effective Altruism|website=www.pokerstrategy.com|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livboeree.com/effective-altruism/|title=Effective Altruism {{!}} Liv Boeree|website=www.livboeree.com|language=en-GB|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Singer]] is a prominent advocate of effective altruism.]]
Effective altruism differs from other philanthropic practices because of its emphasis on quantitatively comparing charitable causes and interventions with the goal of maximizing certain human values. In this way it is similar to [[consequentialism]], which some leaders of the movement explicitly endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity|title = You have $8 billion. You want to do as much good as possible. What do you do?|authorlink = Dylan Matthews|last = Matthews|first = Dylan|date = April 24, 2015|accessdate = August 4, 2015|publisher = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The views of the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in particular helped give rise to the effective altruist movement.&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality" /&gt; Singer's book ''[[The Life You Can Save]]'' argued for the basic philosophy of effective giving, claiming that people have a moral imperative to donate more because of the existence of extreme poverty. In the book, Singer argued that people should use [[charity evaluators]] to determine how to make their donations most effective. Singer personally gives a third of his income to charity.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

===Impartiality===

Effective altruists reject the view that some lives are intrinsically more valuable than others. For example, they believe that a person in a developing country has equal value to a person in one's own community.&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jollimore|first1=Troy|title=Impartiality|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impartiality/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=March 11, 2017|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1972 essay '[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]', Peter Singer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It makes no difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. ... The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously ..., this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.&lt;ref name="singer1972"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fringer.org/wp-content/writings/famine.pdf |title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality |format=PDF |year=1972 |page=231 |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106212947/http://www.fringer.org/wp-content/writings/famine.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, many effective altruists think that future generations have equal moral value to currently existing people, and focus on reducing [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|existential risks to humanity]]. Others believe that the interests of [[Personhood|non-human animals]] should be accorded the same moral weight as similar interests of humans and work to prevent the suffering of animals,&lt;ref name="skelton" /&gt; such as those raised in factory farms.&lt;ref name="huffpost-ea-global"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitney|first1=Nico|title=Elon Musk To Address 'Nerd Altruists' At Google HQ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-google-effective-altruism_us_55a56626e4b04740a3de3130|website=Huffington Post|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cause prioritization===
Although there is a growing emphasis on effectiveness and evidence among nonprofits, this is usually done with a single cause in mind, such as education or climate change. Effective altruists, however, seek to compare the relative importance of different causes and choose one objectively, a concept that is usually referred to as cause neutrality.&lt;ref name="gabriel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oliver"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Huw|title='Effective Altruists' Are a New Type of Nice Person|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/why-are-young-people-being-so-altruistic-209|website=Vice|publisher=Vox|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practical-ethics/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/understanding-cause-neutrality/|title=Understanding cause-neutrality - Centre for Effective Altruism|website=Centre for Effective Altruism|language=en-US|access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruists choose the highest priority causes based on whether activities in each cause area could efficiently advance broad goals, such as increasing human or animal welfare, and then focus their attention on interventions in high priority areas. 

Several organizations perform cause prioritization research to answer the question of what causes warrant the highest priority.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causes|url=http://80000hours.org/causes|work=80,000 Hours|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate= June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GiveWell Labs Overview|url=http://www.givewell.org/about/labs|publisher=GiveWell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common priorities among effective altruists include poverty in the [[developing country|developing world]], the suffering of animals in [[factory farming|factory farms]], and [[Global catastrophic risk|risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]].&lt;ref name="doing-good-better" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gabriel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gabriel|first1=Iason|title=Effective Altruism and Its Critics|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2016|volume=33|issue=3|doi=10.1111/japp.12176|url=https://www.academia.edu/13786913/Effective_Altruism_and_Its_Critics_Journal_of_Applied_Philosophy_2016_|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practical-ethics/&gt;

===Cost-effectiveness===
Effective altruist organizations argue that some charities are far more effective than others, either because some do not achieve their goals or because of variability in the cost of achieving those goals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Funding-the-Right-Program | publisher = GiveWell | title = Your dollar goes further when you fund the right program }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dollar-overseas&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas | publisher = GiveWell | title = Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas}}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, they seek to identify charities that are highly [[cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]], meaning that they achieve a large benefit for a given amount of money.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good" /&gt; For example, they select health interventions on the basis of their impact as measured by lives saved per dollar, [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) saved per dollar, or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY) averted per dollar. This measure of disease burden is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.

Some effective altruism organizations use [[randomized controlled trial]]s as a primary form of evidence,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skelton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skelton|first1=Anthony|title=The Ethical Principles of Effective Altruism|journal=Journal of Global Ethics|date=2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137–146|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SKETEP|accessdate= March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are often considered to be at the highest level of strong evidence in healthcare research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/cp30.pdf |title= A guide to the development, implementation and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines |author= National Health and Medical Research Council |date=November 16, 1998 |publisher= Commonwealth of Australia |location = Canberra | isbn = 1-86496-048-5 |page= 56|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Counterfactual reasoning===

Effective altruists argue that [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] reasoning is important to determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume that the best way to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Best jobs for saving the world | first1 = Donna | last1  = Rosato | first2 = Grace | last2 = Wong | date = November 2011 | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/jobs-helping-others/1.html | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 10 "helping" professions and how to train for them | first = Aimee | last = Hosler | date =  June 14, 2011 | publisher = Schools.com | url = http://www.schools.com/articles/10-helping-professions-and-how-to-train-for-them.html | accessdate = 2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.&lt;ref name="todd-career-paper"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Benjamin|title=Which Ethical Careers Make a Difference?: The Replaceability Issue in the Ethics of Career Choice|url=https://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice?auto=download|website=University of Oxford|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Room for more funding===

Effective altruist organizations make philanthropic recommendations for charities on the basis of their current funding need rather than merely evaluating the value of the work itself.&lt;ref name="givewell-interview-huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=Linch|title=How Can You do the Most Good with Your Charitable Giving? This Expert's Answers Might Surprise You|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linch-zhang/how-can-you-do-the-most-g_b_10597442.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate= March 18, 2017|date= June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSIR-holden"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karnofsky|first1=Holden|title=We Should Expect Good Giving To Be Hard (SSIR)|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/we_should_expect_good_giving_to_be_hard|website=Stanford Social Innovation Review|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=March 18, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruists avoid donating to organizations that have no "room for more funding" - those that face bottlenecks other than money which prevent them from spending the funds they have already accumulated or are expected to receive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria/room-for-more-funding Room for More Funding - GiveWell]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a medical charity might not be able to hire enough doctors or nurses to distribute the medical supplies it is capable of purchasing, or it might already be serving all of the potential patients in its market. There are many other organizations which ''do'' have room for more funding, so giving to one of those instead would produce real-world improvements.

==Behavior==

===Donation ===

Effective altruism encourages significant charitable donation. Some believe it is a moral duty to alleviate suffering through donations if the purchases that one forgoes to donate do not cause comparable suffering to oneself,&lt;ref name=singer1972 /&gt; leading some of them to lead a frugal lifestyle in order to give substantially more than is typical in their society.&lt;ref name="kaufman-wise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burton|first1=Paul|title=Family Gives Away Half Their Income To Help Others|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/family-gives-away-half-their-income-to-help-others/|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy focuses on increasing the amount that people donate or identifying nonprofits that best meet the criteria of effective altruism.

[[Giving What We Can]] (GWWC) is an organization which hosts a community of individuals who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income for the remainder of their working lives to the causes that they believe are the most effective. GWWC was founded in November 2009 by [[Toby Ord]], a moral philosopher at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the remainder of his income to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843|title=Toby Ord: Why I'm giving £1m to charity|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date= December 13, 2010|accessdate= March 2, 2013|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, more than 3,200 individuals have taken the pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/#our-members-have-done-some-amazing-things|title=Giving What We Can|website=www.givingwhatwecan.org|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ox-gwwc-pledges"&gt;{{cite news|title=1000 people match Oxford philosopher’s ‘10% of future income’ charity pledge|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-07-15-1000-people-match-oxford-philosopher%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9810-future-income%E2%80%99-charity-pledge|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=University of Oxford|date= July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founders Pledge]] is a similar system run by the nonprofit Founders Forum for Good where startup founders make a legally binding commitment to donate at least 2% of their personal proceeds to charity in the event that they sell their business.&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-80k-interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=One of the most exciting new effective altruist organisations: An interview with David Goldberg of the Founders Pledge|url=https://80000hours.org/2015/11/one-of-the-most-exciting-new-effective-altruist-organisations-an-interview-with-david-goldberg-of-the-founders-pledge/|website=80,000 Hours|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prosser|first1=David|title=Entrepreneurs Pledge Millions To Social Good|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2015/06/10/entrepreneurs-pledge-millions-to-social-good/#3d2f84e66bb9|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=Forbes|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/09/uk-tech-founders-take-the-founders-pledge-to-2-commiting-28m-to-good-causes/|title = UK Tech Founders Take The Founders Pledge To 2%, Committing $28m+ To Good Causes|last = Butcher|first = Mike|date = June 9, 2015|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2016, one year after launch, 430 entrepreneurs had pledged, for an estimated total value of $134 million based on the founders' equity and the companies' valuation.&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-anniversary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Founders Pledge generates £90m in its first year|url=http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/news/founders-pledge-generates-%C2%A390m-its-first-year|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=City Philanthropy|date= May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career selection===

Effective altruists argue that selection of one's career is an important determinant of the amount of good one does,&lt;ref name="oliver" /&gt; both directly (through the services one provides to the world) and indirectly (through the ways one directs the money earned based on the career).&lt;ref name="macaskill-replaceability-paper" /&gt;

[[80,000 Hours]] is an [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based organization in the effective altruism movement that writes articles and conducts one-on-one coaching to help people find careers with a positive social impact.&lt;ref name=yc-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/|title = Want To Make An Impact With Your Work? Try Some Advice From 80,000 Hours|date = August 4, 2015|accessdate = October 31, 2015|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers indirect methods of altruistic employment, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct practices, such as scientific research. It was co-founded by [[William MacAskill]],&lt;ref name="fastcoexist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alcorn|first1=Stan|title=How To Choose An Ethical Career (With Help From Oxford Philosophers)|url=https://www.fastcoexist.com/1682193/how-to-choose-an-ethical-career-with-help-from-oxford-philosophers|website=Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company Inc|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also its current president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the Team|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[earning to give]] strategy has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating large sums of money to charity.&lt;ref name="join-ws-save-world"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Join Wall Street.

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], a columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', criticized effective altruists who adopt the strategy. He wrote that most people who work in finance and other high-paying industries value money for selfish reasons and that being surrounded by these people will cause effective altruists to become less altruistic.&lt;ref name="brooks2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=David | title=The Way to Produce a Person |newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 3, 2013| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Week]]'', Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry argued that the practice was "unsettling".&lt;ref name="gobry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/542955/effective-altruism-really-change-world|title = Can Effective Altruism really change the world?|last = Gobry|first = Pascal-Emmanuel|date = March 16, 2015|accessdate = March 21, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Week]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause priorities==

Effective altruism aspires to be cause-neutral, meaning it is in principle open to helping in whichever areas allow them to do the most good.&lt;ref name=practical-ethics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2013/05/what-is-effective-altruism/|title = What is Effective Altruism?|publisher = Practical Ethics blog|last = MacAskill|first = William|date = May 20, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kissel" /&gt; In practice, most people in the effective altruist movement have prioritized poverty, animal welfare, and risks of the long term future.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name=skelton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/|title=Four focus areas of effective altruism - Effective Altruism Forum|website=effective-altruism.com|language=en|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/|title=A list of the most urgent global issues|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=May 31, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global poverty alleviation===

Global [[poverty alleviation]] has been a focus of some of the earliest and most prominent organizations associated with effective altruism.

Charity evaluator [[GiveWell]] was founded by [[Holden Karnofsky]] and Elie Hassenfeld in 2007 to address poverty and is currently a part of the effective altruism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konduri|first1=Vimal|title=GiveWell Co-Founder Explains Effective Altruism Frameworks|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/4/givewell-founder-effective-altruism/|website=The Harvard Crimson|publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|accessdate= March 10, 2017|ref=crimson|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell-opt-in&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/|title = Effective Altruism|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = August 13, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; GiveWell has argued that the value of donations is greatest for international poverty alleviation and developing world health issues,&lt;ref name="bloomberg-givewell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolfe|first1=Alexandra|title=Hedge Fund Analytics for Nonprofits|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-23/hedge-fund-analytics-for-nonprofits|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg LP|date= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dollar-overseas/&gt; and its leading recommendations have been in these domains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing good by doing well|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21651815-lessons-business-charities-doing-good-doing-well|website=The Economist|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo-elie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/elie-hassenfeld-givewell_n_6927320.html|title = That Time A Hedge Funder Quit His Job And Then Raised $60 Million For Charity|last = Pitney|first = Nico|date = March 26, 2015|accessdate = April 27, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Against Malaria Foundation]], [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]], [[Deworm the World Initiative]], and (earlier) [[VillageReach]] in global health, and [[GiveDirectly]] for direct unconditional cash transfers).

[[Giving What We Can]] is focused on causes related to the alleviation of global poverty&lt;ref name=wsj2011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204528204577010061347756838|title = Small Sacrifice, Big Return|last = Espinoza|first = Javier|authorlink = Javier Espinoza|date = November 28, 2011|accessdate = March 12, 2014|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does in-house research evaluating causes and charities, but largely relies on research by other organizations such as [[GiveWell]].&lt;ref name=gwwc-sources&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/methodology/our-sources|title = Our sources|publisher = Giving What We Can|accessdate = December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization The Life You Can Save, which originated from the [[The Life You Can Save|book by the same name]], also focuses on global poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-do-good-a-conversation-with-the-worlds-leading_us_58cb8dcee4b0537abd956f91|title=How To Do Good: A Conversation With The World’s Leading Ethicist|last=Zhang|first=Linch|date=March 17, 2017|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the initial focus of effective altruism was on direct strategies such as health interventions and cash transfers, there has also been interest in more systematic social, economic, and political reform that would facilitate larger long-term poverty reduction.&lt;ref name="scott-weathers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weathers|first1=Scott|title=Can ‘effective altruism’ change the world?

===Animal welfare===

Many effective altruists believe that reducing [[animal suffering]] should be a major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Matthews, [https://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9067641/william-macaskill-effective-altruism "You have 80,000 hours in your career. Here's how to do the most good with them"], ''Vox'', August 3rd 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2.7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims|title=Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate|date=2010-09-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=June 14, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/GlobalWarningExecutiveSummary1.pdf|title=Global Warming Climate Change and Farm Animal Welfare|last=|first=|publisher=Compassion in World Farming|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fishcount.org.uk/published/standard/fishcountfullrptSR.pdf|title=Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish|last=Mood|first=Alison|publisher=fishcount.org.uk|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction.{{sfn|Singer|2015|pp=138, 146–147}} Philosophically, [[wild animal suffering]] may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Effective Altruism for Animals" Panel, Animal Studies|url=http://animalstudies.as.nyu.edu/object/as.events.20150729|website=New York University Animal Studies Initiative|publisher=NYU|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an organization connected with the movement that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their cost-effectiveness and transparency, particularly those that are tackling [[factory farming]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Daniel Engber, [http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/08/animal_activists_crunched_the_numbers_to_learn_that_the_creature_most_in.html "Save the Chicken"], ''Slate'', August 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singer|2015|p=139}} [[Faunalytics]] (formerly the Humane Research Council) is an organization loosely affiliated with the movement that conducts independent research on important animal welfare topics, provides resources for advocates and donors, and works with animal protection organizations to evaluate their work.

===Long term future and global catastrophic risks===

Focusing on the long-term future, some effective altruists believe that the total value of any meaningful metric (wealth, potential for suffering, potential for happiness, etc.) summed up over future generations, far exceeds the value for people living today.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name="eaf-far-future"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of the Far Future|url=https://ea-foundation.org/blog/the-importance-of-the-far-future/|website=Effective Altruism Foundation|publisher=Effective Altruism Foundation|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=2003|title=Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.pdf|journal=Utilitas|volume=15|pages=308–314|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the importance of addressing [[existential risk]]s such as dangers associated with [[biotechnology]] and [[Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|advanced artificial intelligence]] is often highlighted and the subject of active research. Because it is often infeasible to use empirical science (such as randomized control trials) to measure the probability of an existential risk, researchers such as [[Nick Bostrom]] have used other methods such as expert opinion elicitation to estimate their importance.&lt;ref name="xrisk methods"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rowe |first1=Thomas |last2=Beard |first2=Simon |title=Probabilities, methodologies and the evidence base in existential risk assessments |journal=Working paper,  Centre for the Study of Existential Risk |date=2018 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/89506/1/Beard_Existential-Risk-Assessments_Accepted.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations that work actively on research and advocacy for improving the long term future, and have connections with the effective altruist movement, are the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]], and [[Future of Life Institute]].&lt;ref name="guan-op-ed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guan|first1=Melody|title=The New Social Movement of our Generation: Effective Altruism|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/new-social-movement-generation-effective-altruism/|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=Harvard Political Review|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] is focused on the more narrow mission of aligning advanced artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="washpost-ai"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basulto|first1=Dominic|title=The very best ideas for preventing artificial intelligence from wrecking the planet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/07/07/the-very-best-ideas-for-preventing-artificial-intelligence-from-wrecking-the-planet/|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matthews-ea-global"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=I spent a weekend at Google talking with nerds about charity.

==History as a social movement==

The ideas behind effective altruism, such as [[consequentialism]], have been present in practical ethics for a long time and have been reflected in the writings of philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham,&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ram|first1=Aliya|title=The power and efficacy of effective altruism|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1954323c-8eb3-11e5-8be4-3506bf20cc2b|accessdate= February 14, 2018|work=Financial Times|date= December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]],&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA" /&gt; Peter Singer,&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality" /&gt; and [[Peter Unger]]. A basic argument for altruism was defined in Singer's 1972 paper "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]", in which he argued that people have an obligation to help those in need:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it.&lt;ref name="singer1972" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the movement identifying with the name 'effective altruism' itself only came into being in the late 2000s&lt;ref name="tmgycd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/170/The-Most-Good-You-Can-Do|title = The Most Good You Can Do|last = Singer|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Singer|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''The Life You Can Save''}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a community formed around the groups Giving What We Can and Givewell. It has since been growing in size.&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Jennifer |title=The Lessons of Effective Altruism |url=https://www.ethicsandinternationalaffairs.org/2016/the-lessons-of-effective-altruism/ |website=Ethics &amp; International Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2018 |date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet forum [[LessWrong]] also played a role in the development of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Lazari-Radek|first1=Katarzyna|last2=Singer|first2=Peter|title=Utilitarianism: A Very Short Introduction|date=September 27, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[EA Global|Effective altruism conferences]] have been held since 2013.&lt;ref name="huffpost-ea-global" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exponentialtimes.net/videos/jaan-tallinns-keynote-effective-altruism-summit-2013|title = Jaan Tallinn's Keynote - Effective Altruism Summit 2013 |date = November 13, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015|work= Exponential Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Peter Singer published ''[[The Most Good You Can Do]]'', a book on effective altruism. The book describes the philosophy and social movement of effective altruism and argues in favor of it.&lt;ref name="kristof"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last = Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[William MacAskill]] published his book ''[[Doing Good Better|Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference]]'' which helped to further popularize the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/doing-good-better-william-macaskill-review|title=Doing Good Better by William MacAskill review – if you read this book, you'll change the charities you donate to|last=Shariatmadari|first=David|date=August 20, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 21, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/effective-altruism-where-charity-and-rationality-meet.html|title=Effective Altruism: Where Charity and Rationality Meet|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|date=August 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 21, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/|title=The Greatest Good|last=Thompson|first=Derek|date=June 15, 2015|work=The Atlantic|access-date=May 21, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill also created [[Giving What We Can]] and [[80,000 Hours]], both of which are part of the Centre for Effective Altruism.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Criticism==
[[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] has questioned whether children in distant countries should be treated as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be "internally ennobling".&lt;ref name="brooks2013" /&gt; In the ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'', Ken Berger and Robert Penna of [[Charity Navigator]] condemned effective altruism's practice of "weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another", calling this "moralistic, in the worst sense of the word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism|title = The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism|last = Berger|first = Ken|last2 = Penna|first2 = Robert|date = November 25, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry warns about the "measurement problem", stating that some areas, such as medical research, or helping to reform third-world governance "one grinding step at a time", are hard to measure with controlled cost-effectiveness experiments and therefore risk being undervalued by the effective altruism movement.&lt;ref name="gobry" /&gt; Jennifer Rubenstein also hypothesizes that effective altruism can be biased against causes that are not straightforward to measure.&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA" /&gt;

In ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' magazine, Mathew Snow argued that effective altruism "implores individuals to use their money to procure necessities for those who desperately need them, but says nothing about the system that determines how those necessities are produced and distributed in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/peter-singer-charity-effective-altruism/|title = Against Charity|last = Snow|first = Mathew|date = August 25, 2015|accessdate = September 5, 2016|publisher = ''Jacobin''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various critics have similarly objected to effective altruism on the basis of the fact that its proponents tend not to support political causes such as [[anti-capitalism]] that change "the existing global institutional order".&lt;ref name="Berkey" /&gt; Joshua Kissel has replied that anti-capitalism is compatible with effective altruism in theory, while adding that effective altruists and anti-capitalists have reason to be more sympathetic to each other.&lt;ref name=kissel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=eip/|title = Effective Altruism and Anti-Capitalism:  An Attempt at Reconciliation|last = Kissel|first = Joshua|date = January 31, 2017|accessdate = February 19, 2017|publisher = '' Essays in Philosophy ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Berkey has also argued that support for changing institutions such as capitalism does not contradict the principles of effective altruism, because effective altruism is open to any action that will have the greatest positive impact on the world, including the possibility of changing the existing global institutional order.&lt;ref name=Berkey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berkey |first1=Brian |title=The Institutional Critique of Effective Altruism |journal=Utilitas |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=2 |url=https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Institutional-Critique-of-Effective-Altruism.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Ashton argues that we are separately obligated to donate to effective aid charities and to reform the structures that are responsible for poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashford |first1=Elizabeth |title=Severe Poverty as an Unjust Emergency |journal=The Ethics of Giving: Philosophers' Perspectives on Philanthropy |date=2018 |pages=103-148 |doi=10.1093/oso/9780190648879.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elifba alphabet''' ({{lang-sq|Elifbaja}}, from {{lang-ota|الفبا|Elifbâ}}) was the main writing system for the [[Albanian language]] during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 14th century to 1911. This Albanian variant of the [[Abjad]] [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Ottoman-Persian script]] was used to write the Albanian language. The last version of the ''Elifbaja shqip'' was invented by the leader of the [[Albanian National Awakening]], Moslem scholar [[Rexhep Voka]] (1847-1917).

The [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] was mainly favored by [[Albanian people|Albanian]] [[Muslims]], but also used by some [[Christians]]. After being especially used during the [[Bejte]] poetry, a [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] for the Albanian language in [[Arabic script]] was published in 1861 in [[Constantinople]] by [[Daut Boriçi|Mullah Daut Boriçi]], the leader of the [[League of Prizren]].&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Daut+Bori%C3%A7i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIwtachLbDyAIVhG4-Ch10UwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=Daut%20Bori%C3%A7i&amp;f=false| title=Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World|author=H. T. Norris| page=76|year=1993| publisher=University of South Carolina Press| isbn=9780872499775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1909 and 1910 there were movements by Young Turks supporters to adopt an [[Arabic alphabet]], as they considered the Latin script to be [[Islamization of Albania|un-Islamic]]. In [[Elbasan]], Muslim clerics led a demonstration for the Arabic script, telling their congregations that using the Latin script would make them infidels. In 1911, the Young Turks dropped their opposition to the Latin script, and the [[Latin alphabet]] was invented. In order to eliminate ambiguity in the pronunciation of the Arabic script, [[Rexhep Voka]] developed a customized Arabic alphabet consisting of 44 consonants and vowels, which he published in 1911. However, it was hardly used anymore due to the [[Congress of Monastir]]. Tiranli Fazli then used this script to publish a thirty-two page grammar. Only one Albanian newspaper at the time ever appeared in Arabic script, and it lasted a brief period. Regardless of what script appeared, such material raised Albanian national consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsie: ''The Currents of Moslem and Bektash Writing in Albania (1850–1950).''

==The Franklin Method==
The Franklin Method (in German [[:de:Franklin-Methode|Franklin-Methode]]) was founded in 1994, and was originally for dancers. It was inspired by [[Mabel Elsworth Todd]]'s [[ideokinesis]], Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's Body-Mind Centering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodymindcentering.com/Bonnie/ Body-Mind Centering]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sri Aurobindo]]’s Integral Yoga. Extended from [[dance]] field to every kind of human movement, this method combines dynamic science-based [[imagery]], touch, anatomical embodiment and educational skills to create lasting positive change in body and mind, using a range of simple tools, like balls, Theraband,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nureyev-medical.org/ ''Dance Specific Theraband Conditioning'' article by Eric Franklin, IADMS conference 2003, in Rudolf Nureyev Foundation Medical website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thera-band.com/ Thera-Band website]&lt;/ref&gt; and other daily life objects.

Nov. 2000, p. 54-55]&lt;/ref&gt; In every moment, the ideal combination of [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]], [[joints]], [[gravity]], moving parts, [[connective tissue]], and [[muscles]] must be found and directed by the brain and [[nervous system]] by help of appropriate imagery.
 
Imagery promotes a neurogenic changement of muscular condition which allows immediate results, before any myogenic (muscle tissue) one. Connective tissue and inner organs are also directly stimulated, with touch and visualization, in order to change posture and to obtain an inner and outer balance.The exercises have a considerable impact on lowering structural stress, too.

The method is taught all over the world, including the Universities of [[Vienna]], [[Cologne]], [[Karlsruhe]], The Boston Conservatory and the Juilliard School in [[New York City]]. It is recognized by the health providers in [[Switzerland]] and courses are regularly offered at Dance,&lt;ref&gt;''New York New York What a Wonderful IADMS Conference'' by Rachel-Anne Rist, article in Dancing times magazine, Jan 2003, p. 41, 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Association for Dance Medecine and Science 2010 Conference&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pilates]], [[Yoga]] and [[Physiotherapy]] conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsmed.org/bibsearch.asp?field1=Author&amp;field1text=franklin&amp;bool1=&amp;field2=&amp;field2text=&amp;bool2=&amp;field3=&amp;field3text=&amp;topic=&amp;sortby=/ 26th and 27th Annual Symposium on medical problems of dancers and musicians - APAM (Performing Arts Medicine Association) 2007, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medizin.pr-gateway.de/franklin-methode%C2%AE-beim-18e-symposium-romand-de-physiotherapie-in-lausanne/ 18th Physiotherapy Symposium Lausanne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:wCFUoTXY27IJ:www.vistawell.ch/new/deutsch/d_didactiques/physioth_sept11.pdf+&amp;hl=it&amp;gl=it&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgaIMTfVDHd5KDootkXZZQDoxV0JVMWJed35eXNMm0LEO_lhOMtCXS3NgcHBYwnMX2pJV8_rrFFd5BubCrD8gNr-G_cipf_MQubhFpCJtLC7EQGaxJCaX5jpN1FLXl0Vw_TkDOi&amp;sig=AHIEtbQKd6TAoTWQpKMtGM5qYMn8BHojNQ/ ''article on Franklin Method''] by Bettina Halbach, on PT magazine, sep 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Executive functions''' (collectively referred to as '''executive function''' and '''cognitive control''') are a set of [[cognition|cognitive processes]] that are necessary for the cognitive control of [[behavior]]: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include basic cognitive processes such as [[attentional control]], [[cognitive inhibition]], [[inhibitory control]], [[working memory]], and [[cognitive flexibility]]. Higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include [[planning]] and [[fluid intelligence]] (e.g., [[reasoning]] and [[problem solving]]).&lt;ref name="NHM pathways"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Malenka |first1=RC |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |last3=Hyman |first3=SE | editor1-last=Sydor |editor1-first=A |editor2-last=Brown |editor2-first=RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 155–157 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 6: Widely Projecting Systems: Monoamines, Acetylcholine, and Orexin | quote=DA has multiple actions in the prefrontal cortex.

Noradrenergic projections from the LC thus interact with dopaminergic projections from the VTA to regulate cognitive control.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions 2008 review"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2008|title=Assessment of executive functions: review of instruments and identification of critical issues|journal=Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=201–216|doi=10.1016/j.acn.2007.08.010|pmid=18096360|quote=The term "executive functions" is an umbrella term comprising a wide range of cognitive processes and behavioral competencies which include verbal reasoning, problem-solving, planning, sequencing, the ability to sustain attention, resistance to interference, utilization of feedback, multitasking, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to deal with novelty (Burgess, Veitch, de lacy Costello, &amp; Shallice, 2000; Damasio, 1995; Grafman &amp; Litvan, 1999; Shallice, 1988; Stuss &amp; Benson, 1986; Stuss, Shallice, Alexander, &amp; Picton, 1995).|vauthors=Chan RC, Shum D, Toulopoulou T, Chen EY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt; Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt; Both [[neuropsychological test]]s (e.g., the [[Stroop test]]) and rating scales (e.g., the [[Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function]]) are used to measure executive functions. They are usually performed as part of a [[neuropsychological assessment|more comprehensive assessment]] to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Cognitive control and [[stimulus control]], which is associated with [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[classical conditioning]], represent opposite processes (internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors;&lt;ref name="Cognitive – stimulus"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Washburn |first1=DA | title = The Stroop effect at 80: The competition between stimulus control and cognitive control | journal = J Exp Anal Behav | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–13 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26781048 | doi = 10.1002/jeab.194 | quote = Today, arguably more than at any time in history, the constructs of attention, executive functioning, and cognitive control seem to be pervasive and preeminent in research and theory. Even within the cognitive framework, however, there has long been an understanding that behavior is multiply determined, and that many responses are relatively automatic, unattended, contention-scheduled, and habitual. Indeed, the cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and self-regulation that appear to be hallmarks of cognitive control are noteworthy only in contrast to responses that are relatively rigid, associative, and involuntary. }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, inhibitory control is necessary for overriding stimulus-driven behavioral responses (stimulus control of behavior).&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Diamond |first1=Adele |author1-link=Adele Diamond | title = Executive functions | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking "outside the box," seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten &amp; Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker &amp; Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo &amp; Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;EFs can be improved (Diamond &amp; Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&amp;nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson &amp; Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&amp;nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn't make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&amp;nbsp;... The subthalamic nucleus appears to play a critical role in preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}}&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084861/figure/F4/ Figure 4: Executive functions and related terms]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prefrontal cortex]] is necessary but not solely sufficient for executive functions;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EFmeta-analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-PFC cognitive processes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malenka |first1=RC |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |last3=Hyman |first3=SE |editor1-last=Sydor |editor1-first=A |editor2-last=Brown |editor2-first=RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | page = 315 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control | quote = However, damage to the prefrontal cortex has a significant deleterious effect on social behavior, decision making, and adaptive responding to the changing circumstances of life.&amp;nbsp;... Several subregions of the prefrontal cortex have been implicated in partly distinct aspects of cognitive control, although these distinctions remain somewhat vaguely defined. The ''anterior cingulate cortex'' is involved in processes that require correct decision-making, as seen in conflict resolution (eg, the Stroop test, see in Chapter 16), or cortical inhibition (eg, stopping one task and switching to another). The ''medial prefrontal cortex'' is involved in supervisory attentional functions (eg, action-outcome rules) and behavioral flexibility (the ability to switch strategies). The ''dorsolateral prefrontal cortex'', the last brain area to undergo myelination during development in late adolescence, is implicated in matching sensory inputs with planned motor responses. The ''ventromedial prefrontal cortex'' seems to regulate social cognition, including empathy. The ''orbitofrontal cortex'' is involved in social decision making and in representing the valuations assigned to different experiences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[subthalamic nucleus]] also have a role in mediating inhibitory control.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control" /&gt;

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&amp;nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior.

== Neuroanatomy ==
Historically, the executive functions have been seen as regulated by the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes, but it is still a matter of ongoing debate if that really is the case.&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarez|first1=Julie A.|last2=Emory|first2=Eugene |title=Executive function and the frontal lobes: A meta-analytic review|journal=Neuropsychology Review|year=2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=17–42|doi=10.1007/s11065-006-9002-x|pmid=16794878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though articles on prefrontal lobe lesions commonly refer to disturbances of executive functions and vice versa, a review found indications for the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] but not for the [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of executive function measures to frontal lobe functioning. This means that both frontal and non-frontal brain regions are necessary for intact executive functions. Probably &lt;!-- this is not an editor writing weasel words, but the word that the authors of the referenced article use--&gt; the frontal lobes need to participate in basically all of the executive functions, but it is not the only brain structure involved.&lt;!-- to anyone who wants to copyedit this sentence: the original sentence in the article is: "Thus, participation of the frontal lobes in virtually any "executive process" is probably a necessary, but largely insufficient, requirement.--&gt;&lt;ref name="EFmeta-analysis" /&gt;

* The  [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) is involved in emotional drives, experience and integration.&lt;ref name=Lezak /&gt; Associated cognitive functions include inhibition of inappropriate responses, decision making and motivated behaviors. Lesions in this area can lead to low drive states such as [[apathy]], [[abulia]] or [[akinetic mutism]] and may also result in low drive states for such basic needs as food or drink and possibly decreased interest in social or vocational activities and sex.&lt;ref name=Lezak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allman|first1=John M. |last2=Hakeem|first2=Atiya |last3=Erwin|first3=Joseph M. |last4=Nimchinsky|first4=Esther |last5=Hof|first5=Patrick |title=The anterior cingulate cortex: the evolution of an interface between emotion and cognition|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2001|volume=935|issue=1|pages=107–117|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03476.x|pmid=11411161|bibcode=2001NYASA.935..107A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The  [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (OFC) plays a key role in impulse control, maintenance of set, monitoring ongoing behavior and socially appropriate behaviors.&lt;ref name=Lezak /&gt; The orbitofrontal cortex also has roles in representing the value of rewards based on sensory stimuli and evaluating subjective emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolls |first1=Edmund T. |last2=Grabenhorst|first2=Fabian |title=The orbitofrontal cortex and beyond: From affect to decision-making|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|year=2008|volume=86|issue=3|pages=216–244|doi= 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.09.001|pmid=18824074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions can cause disinhibition, impulsivity, aggressive outbursts, sexual promiscuity and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis /&gt;

Furthermore, in their review, Alvarez and Emory state that: "The frontal lobes have multiple connections to cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites. The basis of 'higher-level' cognitive functions such as inhibition, flexibility of thinking, problem solving, planning, impulse control, concept formation, abstract thinking, and creativity often arise from much simpler, 'lower-level' forms of cognition and behavior. Thus, the concept of executive function must be broad enough to include anatomical structures that represent a diverse and diffuse portion of the central nervous system."&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis /&gt;

The [[cerebellum]] also appears to be involved in mediating certain executive functions.&lt;ref name="pmid22068584"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koziol LF, Budding DE, Chidekel D | title = From movement to thought: executive function, embodied cognition, and the cerebellum | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 505–25 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22068584 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-011-0321-y | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25439295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noroozian M | title = The role of the cerebellum in cognition: beyond coordination in the central nervous system | journal = Neurol Clin | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 1081–104 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25439295 | doi = 10.1016/j.ncl.2014.07.005 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesized role ==

The executive system is thought to be heavily involved in handling novel situations outside the domain of some of our 'automatic' psychological processes that could be explained by the reproduction of learned [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] or set behaviors. Psychologists [[Don Norman]] and [[Tim Shallice]] have outlined five types of situations in which routine activation of behavior would not be sufficient for optimal performance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norman|first1=DA |author1-link=Don Norman |last2=Shallice|first2=T |author2-link=Tim Shallice |date=1980 |chapter=Attention to action: Willed and automatic control of behaviour |editor1-last=Gazzaniga|editor1-first=MS |title=Cognitive neuroscience: a reader |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |publication-date=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-631-21660-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}
# Those that involve planning or decision making
# Those that involve error correction or troubleshooting
# Situations where responses are not well-rehearsed or contain novel sequences of actions
# Dangerous or technically difficult situations
# Situations that require the overcoming of a strong habitual response or resisting temptation.

A ''prepotent response'' is a response for which immediate [[reinforcement]] (positive or negative) is available or has been previously associated with that response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barkley |first1=Russell A. |last2=Murphy |first2=Kevin R. |date=2006 |title=Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Clinical Workbook |edition=3rd |volume=2 |isbn=978-1-59385-227-6 |oclc=314949058 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} The executive functions are often invoked when it is necessary to override these prepotent responses that might otherwise be automatically elicited by stimuli in the external environment. For example, on being presented with a potentially rewarding stimulus, such as a tasty piece of [[chocolate cake]], a person might have the automatic response to take a bite.  However, where such behavior conflicts with internal plans (such as having decided not to eat chocolate cake while on a diet), the executive functions might be engaged to inhibit that response.

Although suppression of these prepotent responses is ordinarily considered adaptive, problems for the development of the individual and the culture arise when feelings of right and wrong are overridden by cultural expectations or when creative impulses are overridden by executive inhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cherkes-Julkowski|first1=Miriam |title=The DYSfunctionality of Executive Function |publisher=Surviving Education Guides |location=Apache Junction, AZ |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-9765299-2-7 |oclc=77573143 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

== Historical perspective ==

Although research into the executive functions and their neural basis has increased markedly over recent years, the theoretical framework in which it is situated is not new. In the 1940s, the British psychologist [[Donald Broadbent]] drew a distinction between "automatic" and "controlled" processes (a distinction characterized more fully by [[Richard Shiffrin|Shiffrin]] and Schneider in 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shiffrin|first1=RM |last2=Schneider|first2=W |title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: II: Perceptual learning, automatic attending, and a general theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=127–90 |date=March 1977 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.127 |citeseerx=10.1.1.227.1856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the notion of [[selective attention]], to which executive functions are closely allied.  In 1975, the US psychologist [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]] used the term "cognitive control" in his book chapter entitled "Attention and cognitive control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Posner |first1=MI |last2=Snyder |first2=CRR |chapter=Attention and cognitive control |editor1-last=Solso |editor1-first=RL |title=Information processing and cognition: the Loyola symposium |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-470-81230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of influential researchers such as Michael Posner, [[Joaquin Fuster]], [[Tim Shallice]], and their colleagues in the 1980s (and later [[Trevor Robbins]], Bob Knight, Don Stuss, and others) laid much of the groundwork for recent research into executive functions.  For example, Posner proposed that there is a separate "executive" branch of the attentional system, which is responsible for focusing [[attention]] on selected aspects of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posner|first1=MI |last2=Petersen|first2=SE |title=The attention system of the human brain |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=25–42 |year=1990 |pmid=2183676 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.13.030190.000325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[neuropsychologist]] Tim Shallice similarly suggested that attention is regulated by a "supervisory system", which can override automatic responses in favour of scheduling behaviour on the basis of plans or intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shallice |first1=T |title=From neuropsychology to mental structure |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-521-31360-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, a consensus emerged that this control system is housed in the most anterior portion of the brain, the [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC).

Psychologist [[Alan Baddeley]] had proposed a similar system as part of his model of [[working memory]]&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986 /&gt; and argued that there must be a component (which he named the "central executive") that allows information to be manipulated in [[short-term memory]] (for example, when doing [[mental arithmetic]]).

== Development ==
{{further|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Cognitive control and memory}}
The executive functions are among the last mental functions to reach maturity. This is due to the delayed maturation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is not completely [[myelination|myelinated]] until well into a person's third decade of life. Development of executive functions tends to occur in spurts, when new skills, strategies, and forms of awareness emerge.

=== Early childhood ===
[[Inhibitory control]] and [[working memory]] act as basic executive functions that makes it possible for more complex executive functions like problem-solving to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Senn|first1=TE|last2=Espy|first2=KA |last3=Kaufmann|first3=PM |title=Using path analysis to understand executive function organization in preschool children |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |pages=445–464 |year=2004 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2601_5 |pmid=15276904 |issue=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/dcnlfacpub/8|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibitory control and working memory are among the earliest executive functions to appear, with initial signs observed in infants, 7 to 12-months old.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2002 /&gt; Then in the preschool years, children display a spurt in performance on tasks of inhibition and working memory, usually between the ages of 3 to 5 years.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Best2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Best|first1=JR |last2=Miller|first2=PH |last3=Jones|first3=LL |title=Executive functions after age 5: Changes and correlates |journal=Developmental Review |volume=29 |pages=180–200 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2009.05.002 |pmid=20161467 |issue=3 |pmc=2792574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this time, cognitive flexibility, goal-directed behavior, and planning begin to develop.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;  Nevertheless, preschool children do not have fully mature executive functions and continue to make errors related to these emerging abilities – often not due to the absence of the abilities, but rather because they lack the awareness to know when and how to use particular strategies in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Espy |first1=KA |title=Using developmental, cognitive, and neuroscience approaches to understand executive functions in preschool children |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |pages=379–384 |year=2004 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2601_1 |pmid=15276900 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preadolescence ===
Preadolescent children continue to exhibit certain growth spurts in executive functions, suggesting that this development does not necessarily occur in a linear manner, along with the preliminary maturing of particular functions as well.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2002 /&gt;  During preadolescence, children display major increases in verbal working memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brocki|first1=KC |last2=Bohlin|first2=G |title=Executive functions in children aged 6 to 13: A dimensional and developmental study; |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |pages=571–593 |year=2004 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2602_3 |pmid=15456685 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; goal-directed behavior (with a potential spurt around 12 years of age);&lt;ref name = Anderson2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson|first1=VA|last2=Anderson|first2=P |last3=Northam|first3=E |last4=Jacobs|first4=R |last5=Catroppa|first5=C |title=Development of executive functions through late childhood and adolescence in an Australian sample |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=20 |pages=385–406 |year=2001 |doi=10.1207/S15326942DN2001_5 |pmid=11827095 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; response inhibition and selective attention;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klimkeit|first1=EI |last2=Mattingley|first2=JB |last3=Sheppard|first3=DM |last4=Farrow|first4=M |last5=Bradshaw|first5=JL |title=Examining the development of attention and executive functions in children with a novel paradigm |journal=Child Neuropsychology |volume=10 |pages=201–211 |year=2004 |pmid=15590499 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/09297040409609811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and strategic planning and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=Anderson2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeLuca2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Luca|first1=CR |last2=Wood|first2=SJ |last3=Anderson|first3=V |last4=Buchanan|first4=JA |last5=Proffitt|first5=T |last6=Mahony|first6=K |last7=Pantelis|first7=C |title=Normative data from the CANTAB I: Development of executive function over the lifespan |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=25 |pages=242–254 |year=2003 |doi=10.1076/jcen.25.2.242.13639 |pmid=12754681 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Luciana2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luciana|first1=M |last2=Nelson|first2=CA |title=Assessment of neuropsychological function through use of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery:  Performance in 4- to 12-year old children |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=22 |pages=595–624 |year=2002 |doi=10.1207/S15326942DN2203_3 |pmid=12661972 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, between the ages of 8 to 10, [[cognitive flexibility]] in particular begins to match adult levels.&lt;ref name=DeLuca2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Luciana2002 /&gt;  However, similar to patterns in childhood development, executive functioning in preadolescents is limited because they do not reliably apply these executive functions across multiple contexts as a result of ongoing development of inhibitory control.&lt;ref name=DeLuca2008 /&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Many executive functions may begin in childhood and preadolescence, such as inhibitory control. Yet, it is during adolescence when the different brain systems become better integrated. At this time, youth implement executive functions, such as inhibitory control, more efficiently and effectively and improve throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=Luna2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luna|first1=B |last2=Garver|first2=KE |last3=Urban|first3=TA |last4=Lazar|first4=NA | author4-link = Nicole Lazar |last5=Sweeney|first5=JA |title=Maturation of cognitive processes from late childhood to adulthood |journal=Child Development |volume=75 |pages=1357–1372 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00745.x |pmid=15369519 |issue=5 |citeseerx=10.1.1.498.6633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leon-Carrion|first1=J |last2=García-Orza|first2=J |last3=Pérez-Santamaría|first3=FJ |title=Development of the inhibitory component of the executive functions in children and adolescents |journal=International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=114 |pages=1291–1311 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/00207450490476066 |pmid=15370187 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as inhibitory control emerges in childhood and improves over time, planning and goal-directed behavior also demonstrate an extended time course with ongoing growth over adolescence.&lt;ref name=Best2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Anderson2001 /&gt;  Likewise, functions such as attentional control, with a potential spurt at age 15,&lt;ref name = Anderson2001 /&gt; along with working memory,&lt;ref name=Luna2004 /&gt; continue developing at this stage.

=== Adulthood ===
The major change that occurs in the brain in adulthood is the constant myelination of neurons in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt; At age 20–29, executive functioning skills are at their peak, which allows people of this age to participate in some of the most challenging mental tasks. These skills begin to decline in later adulthood. Working memory and spatial span are areas where decline is most readily noted. Cognitive flexibility, however, has a late onset of impairment and does not usually start declining until around age 70 in normally functioning adults.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt; Impaired executive functioning has been found to be the best predictor of functional decline in the elderly.

== Models ==

=== Top-down inhibitory control ===
Aside from facilitatory or amplificatory mechanisms of control, many authors have argued for [[Cognitive inhibition|inhibitory mechanisms]] in the domain of response control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aron|first1=AR |last2=Poldrack|first2=RA |title=Cortical and subcortical contributions to Stop signal response inhibition: role of the subthalamic nucleus |journal=J.

=== Working memory model ===
One influential model is Baddeley's multicomponent model of working memory, which is composed of a central executive system that regulates three other subsystems: the phonological loop, which maintains verbal information; the visuospatial sketchpad, which maintains visual and spatial information; and the more recently developed episodic buffer that integrates short-term and long-term memory, holding and manipulating a limited amount of information from multiple domains in temporal and spatially sequenced episodes.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Alan D. |author1-link=Alan Baddeley |title=Working memory |series=Oxford psychology series |volume=11 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-852116-7 |oclc=13125659 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Alan |chapter=16 Fractionating the Central Executive |editor1-last=Knight |editor1-first=Robert L. |editor2-last=Stuss |editor2-first=Donald T. |title=Principles of frontal lobe function |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages=246–260 |isbn=978-0-19-513497-1 |oclc=48383566 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervisory attentional system (SAS) ===
Another conceptual model is the [[supervisory attentional system]] (SAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=DA |last2=Shallice |first2=T |chapter=Attention to action: Willed and automatic control of behaviour |editor1-last=Shapiro |editor1-first=David L. |editor2-last=Schwartz |editor2-first=Gary |title=Consciousness and self-regulation: advances in research |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |orig-year=1976 |date=1986 |pages=1–14 |isbn=978-0-306-33601-0 |oclc=2392770  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shallice|first1=Tim |last2=Burgess|first2=Paul |last3=Robertson|first3=I. |title= The domain of supervisory processes and temporal organisation of behaviour |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=351 |pages=1405–1412 |year=1996 |doi= 10.1098/rstb.1996.0124 |issue= 1346 |pmid=8941952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, contention scheduling is the process where an individual's well-established schemas automatically respond to routine situations while executive functions are used when faced with novel situations.  In these new situations, attentional control will be a crucial element to help generate new schema, implement these schema, and then assess their accuracy.

=== Self-regulatory model ===
[[Russell Barkley]] proposed a widely known model of executive functioning that is based on [[Self-control|self-regulation]]. Primarily derived from work examining behavioral inhibition, it views executive functions as composed of four main abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barkley |first1=RA |title= Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions:  Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD |journal= Psychological Bulletin |volume=121 |pages=65–94 |year=1997 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.121.1.65 |pmid= 9000892 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One element is working memory that allows individuals to resist interfering information. A second component is the management of emotional responses in order to achieve goal-directed behaviors. Thirdly, internalization of self-directed speech is used to control and sustain rule-governed behavior and to generate plans for problem-solving. Lastly, information is analyzed and synthesized into new behavioral responses to meet one's goals. Changing one's behavioral response to meet a new goal or modify an objective is a higher level skill that requires a fusion of executive functions including self-regulation, and accessing prior knowledge and experiences.

According to this model, the executive system of the human brain provides for the cross-temporal organization of behavior towards goals and the future and coordinates actions and strategies for everyday goal-directed tasks. Essentially, this system permits humans to self-regulate their behavior so as to sustain action and problem solving toward goals specifically and the future more generally. Thus, executive function deficits pose serious problems for a person's ability to engage in self-regulation over time to attain their goals and anticipate and prepare for the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Russell A.

=== Problem-solving model ===
Yet another model of executive functions is a problem-solving framework where executive functions is considered a macroconstruct composed of subfunctions working in different phases to (a) represent a problem, (b) plan for a solution by selecting and ordering strategies, (c) maintain the strategies in short-term memory in order to perform them by certain rules, and then (d) evaluate the results with error detection and error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelazo|first1=PD |last2=Carter|first2=A |last3=Reznick|first3=J |last4=Frye|first4=D |title= Early development of executive function:  A problem-solving framework |journal= Review of General Psychology |volume=1 |pages=198–226 |year=1997 |doi= 10.1037/1089-2680.1.2.198 |issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lezak's conceptual model ===
One of the most widespread conceptual models on executive functions is Lezak's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lezak |first1=Muriel Deutsch |title=Neuropsychological assessment |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |edition=3rd |oclc=925640891 |isbn=978-0-19-509031-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework proposes four broad domains of volition, planning, purposive action, and effective performance as working together to accomplish global executive functioning needs. While this model may broadly appeal to clinicians and researchers to help identify and assess certain executive functioning components, it lacks a distinct theoretical basis and relatively few attempts at validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=PJ |chapter=Towards a developmental framework of executive function |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=V |editor2-last=Jacobs |editor2-first=R |editor3-last=Anderson |editor3-first=PJ |title=Executive functions and the frontal lobes: A lifespan perspective |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |year=2008 |pages=3–21 |oclc=182857040 |isbn=978-1-84169-490-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miller &amp; Cohen's model ===
In 2001,  Earl Miller and Jonathan Cohen published their article "An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function", in which they argue that cognitive control is the primary function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and that control is implemented by increasing the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of sensory or motor [[neuron]]s that are engaged by task- or goal-relevant elements of the external environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1=EK |last2=Cohen|first2=JD |title=An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=167–202 |year=2001 |pmid=11283309 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a key paragraph, they argue:

{{quote|We assume that the PFC serves a specific function in cognitive control: the active maintenance of patterns of activity that represent goals and the means to achieve them. They provide bias signals throughout much of the rest of the brain, affecting not only visual processes but also other sensory modalities, as well as systems responsible for response execution, memory retrieval, emotional evaluation, etc. The aggregate effect of these bias signals is to guide the flow of neural activity along pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task.}}

Miller and Cohen draw explicitly upon an earlier theory of visual attention that conceptualises perception of visual scenes in terms of competition among multiple representations – such as colors, individuals, or objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desimone|first1=R |last2=Duncan|first2=J |title=Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=193–222 |year=1995 |pmid=7605061 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.18.030195.001205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[selective attention|Selective visual attention]] acts to 'bias' this competition in favour of certain selected features or representations.  For example, imagine that you are waiting at a busy train station for a friend who is wearing a red coat.  You are able to selectively narrow the focus of your attention to search for red objects, in the hope of identifying your friend.  Desimone and Duncan argue that the brain achieves this by selectively increasing the gain of neurons responsive to the color red, such that output from these neurons is more likely to reach a downstream [[information processing|processing stage]], and, as a consequence, to guide [[behaviour]]. According to Miller and Cohen, this [[selective attention]] mechanism is in fact just a special case of cognitive control – one in which the biasing occurs in the sensory domain.  According to Miller and Cohen's model, the PFC can exert control over input (sensory) or output (response) [[neuron]]s, as well as over assemblies involved in [[memory]], or [[emotion]].  Cognitive control is mediated by reciprocal PFC [[functional integration|connectivity]] with the [[sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[motor cortex|motor cortices]], and with the [[limbic system]].  Within their approach, thus, the term 'cognitive control' is applied to any situation where a biasing signal is used to promote task-appropriate responding, and control thus becomes a crucial component of a  wide range of psychological constructs such as [[selective attention]], error monitoring, [[decision-making]], [[memory inhibition]], and response inhibition.

=== Miyake and Friedman's model ===
Miyake and Friedman's theory of executive functions proposes that there are three aspects of executive functions: updating, inhibition, and shifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miyake|first1=A |last2=Friedman|first2=NP |last3=Emerson|first3=MJ |last4=Witzki|first4=AH |last5=Howerter|first5=A |last6=Wager|first6=TD |title=The unity and diversity of executive functions and their contributions to complex 'frontal lobe' tasks: A latent variable analysis |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=41|pages=49–100 |year=2000 |doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0734 |pmid=10945922 |issue=1 |citeseerx=10.1.1.485.1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cornerstone of this theoretical framework is the understanding that individual differences in executive functions reflect both unity (i.e., common EF skills) and diversity of each component (e.g., shifting-specific).  In other words, aspects of updating, inhibition, and shifting are related, yet each remains a distinct entity.  First, updating is defined as the continuous monitoring and quick addition or deletion of contents within one's working memory.  Second, inhibition is one's capacity to supersede responses that are prepotent in a given situation.  Third, shifting is one's cognitive flexibility to switch between different tasks or mental states.

Miyake and Friedman also suggest that the current body of research in executive functions suggest four general conclusions about these skills. The first conclusion is the unity and diversity aspects of executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaughan|first1=L |last2=Giovanello|first2=K |title=Executive function in daily life: Age-related influences of executive processes on instrumental activities of daily living |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=25 |pages=343–355 |year=2010 |doi=10.1037/a0017729 |pmid=20545419 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiebe|first1=SA |last2=Espy|first2=KA |last3=Charak|first3=D |title=Using confirmatory factor analysis to understand executive control in preschool children: I.

=== Banich's "Cascade of control" model ===
This model from 2009 integrates theories from other models, and involves a sequential cascade of brain regions involved in maintaining attentional sets in order to arrive at a goal. In sequence, the model assumes the involvement of the posterior [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC), the mid-DLPFC, and the posterior and anterior dorsal ACC.&lt;ref name = Banich2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banich |first1=MT |title= Executive function: The search for an integrated account |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |pages=89–94 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01615.x |issue=2 |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~mbanich/p/SearchIntegratedAccount.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive task used in the article is selecting a response in the [[Stroop task]], among conflicting color and word responses, specifically a stimulus where the word "green" is printed in red ink. The posterior DLPFC creates an appropriate attentional set, or rules for the brain to accomplish the current goal. For the Stroop task, this involves activating the areas of the brain involved in color perception, and not those involved in word comprehension. It counteracts biases and irrelevant information, like the fact that the semantic perception of the word is more salient to most people than the color in which it is printed.

Next, the mid-DLPFC selects the representation that will fulfill the goal. The task-relevant information must be separated from other sources of information in the task. In the example, this means focusing on the ink color and not the word.

The posterior dorsal  [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) is next in the cascade, and it is responsible for response selection. This is where the decision is made whether you will say green (the written word and the incorrect answer) or red (the font color and correct answer).

Following the response, the anterior dorsal ACC is involved in response evaluation, deciding whether you were correct or incorrect. Activity in this region increases when the probability of an error is higher.

The activity of any of the areas involved in this model depends on the efficiency of the areas that came before it. If the DLPFC imposes a lot of control on the response, the ACC will require less activity.&lt;ref name = Banich2009 /&gt;

Recent work using individual differences in cognitive style has shown exciting support for this model. Researchers had participants complete an auditory version of the Stroop task, in which either the location or semantic meaning of a directional word had to be attended to. Participants that either had a strong bias toward spatial or semantic information (different cognitive styles) were then recruited to participate in the task. As predicted, participants that has a strong bias toward spatial information had more difficulty paying attention to the semantic information and elicited increased electrophysiological activity from the ACC. A similar activity pattern was also found for participants that had a strong bias toward verbal information when they tried to attend to spatial information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 23994425| year = 2013| last1=Buzzell|first1=GA |last2=Roberts|first2=DM |last3=Baldwin|first3=CL |last4=McDonald|first4=CG | title = An electrophysiological correlate of conflict processing in an auditory spatial Stroop task: The effect of individual differences in navigational style| journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology| volume = 90| issue = 2| pages = 265–71| doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==

Assessment of executive functions involves gathering data from several sources and synthesizing the information to look for trends and patterns across time and settings. Apart from standardized neuropsychological tests, other measures can and should be used, such as [[behaviour checklist]]s, [[observations]], [[interviews]], and [[work samples]]. From these, conclusions may be drawn on the use of executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Castellanos|first1=Irina|last2=Kronenberger|first2=William G.|last3=Pisoni|first3=David B.|date=|year=2016|title=Questionnaire-based assessment of executive functioning: Psychometrics|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina_Castellanos/publication/309101878_Questionnaire-based_assessment_of_executive_functioning_in_pediatric_psychology_Psychometrics/links/582a1b7908ae138f1bf31c9e.pdf|journal=Applied Neuropsychology: Child|volume=0|issue=2|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/21622965.2016.1248557|pmid=27841670|quote=Clinical  evaluation  of  EF  typically  includes  an  office-  based  visit  involving  administration  of  a  battery  of   neuropsychological assessment instruments.  Despite  their advantages,  however,  individually-administered  neuro-psychological measures of EF have two primary limitations:  First,  in  most  cases,  they  must  be  individually  administered and scored by a technician or professional  in an office setting, which limits their utility for screening  or  brief  assessment  purposes.  Second,  relations between office-based  neuropsychological  measures  of  EF  and  actual  behavior  in  the  daily  environment  are modest (Barkley, 2012), leading to some caution when applying neuropsychological test results to conclusions about behavioral outcomes. As a result of these limitations of office-based neuropsychological tests of EF, parent- and teacher-report behavior checklist measures of EF have  been  developed for both  screening  purposes and  to complement  the results of performance-based neuropsychological  testing  by providing reports  of  EF  behavior  in  daily life  (Barkley, 2011b;  Gioia  et  al., 2000; Naglieri &amp; Goldstein,  2013). These checklists have the advantage of good psychometrics, strong ecological validity, and high clinical utility as a result of their ease of administration, scoring, and interpretation."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different kinds of instruments (e.g., performance based, self-report) that measure executive functions across development. These assessments can serve a diagnostic purpose for a number of clinical populations.

== Experimental evidence ==

The executive system has been traditionally quite hard to define, mainly due to what psychologist [[Paul W. Burgess]] calls a lack of "process-behaviour correspondence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rabbitt |first1=PMA |chapter=Theory and methodology in executive function research |title=Methodology of frontal and executive function |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-86377-485-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, there is no single behavior that can in itself be tied to executive function, or indeed [[executive dysfunction]]. For example, it is quite obvious what reading-impaired patients cannot do, but it is not so obvious what exactly executive-impaired patients might be incapable of.

This is largely due to the nature of the executive system itself. It is mainly concerned with the dynamic, "online" co-ordination of cognitive resources, and, hence, its effect can be observed only by measuring other cognitive processes. In similar manner, it does not always fully engage outside of real-world situations. As [[neurologist]] [[Antonio Damasio]] has reported, a patient with severe day-to-day executive problems may still pass paper-and-pencil or lab-based tests of executive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saver|first1=JL |last2=Damasio|first2=AR |title=Preserved access and processing of social knowledge in a patient with acquired sociopathy due to ventromedial frontal damage |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1241–9 |year=1991 |pmid=1791934 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(91)90037-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of the executive system were largely driven by observations of patients having suffered [[frontal lobe]] damage. They exhibited disorganized actions and strategies for everyday tasks (a group of behaviors now known as [[dysexecutive syndrome]]) although they seemed to perform normally when clinical or lab-based tests were used to assess more fundamental cognitive functions such as [[memory]], [[learning]], [[language]], and [[reasoning]]. It was hypothesized that, to explain this unusual behaviour, there must be an overarching system that co-ordinates other cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Shimamura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shimamura |first1=AP |title=The role of the prefrontal cortex in dynamic filtering |journal= Psychobiology |volume=28 |pages=207–218 |year=2000 |doi=10.3758/BF03331979|doi-broken-date=2018-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the experimental evidence for the neural structures involved in executive functions comes from laboratory tasks such as the [[stroop effect|Stroop task]] or the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Task]] (WCST).  In the Stroop task, for example, human subjects are asked to name the color that color words are printed in when the ink color and word meaning often conflict (for example, the word "RED" in green ink). Executive functions are needed to perform this task, as the relatively overlearned and automatic behaviour (word reading) has to be inhibited in favour of a less practiced task – naming the ink color.  Recent [[functional neuroimaging]] studies have shown that two parts of the PFC, the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) and the [[prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC), are thought to be particularly important for performing this task.

=== Context-sensitivity of PFC neurons ===
Other evidence for the involvement of the PFC in executive functions comes from single-cell [[electrophysiology]] studies in non-human [[primate]]s, such as the [[macaque]] monkey, which have shown that (in contrast to cells in the posterior brain) many PFC neurons are sensitive to a conjunction of a stimulus and a context.  For example, PFC cells might respond to a green cue in a condition where that cue signals that a leftwards fast movement of the eyes and the head should be made, but not to a green cue in another experimental context.  This is important, because the optimal deployment of executive functions is invariably context-dependent.

One example from Miller &amp; Cohen involves a pedestrian crossing the street.  In the United States, where cars drive on the [[Right- and left-hand traffic|right side of the road]], an American learns to look '''left''' when crossing the street.  However, if that American visits a country where cars drive on the left, such as the United Kingdom, then the ''opposite'' behavior would be required (looking to the '''right''').  In this case, the automatic response needs to be suppressed and executive functions must make the American look to the right while in the UK.

Neurologically, this behavioural repertoire clearly requires a neural system that is able to integrate the stimulus (the road) with a context (US or UK) to cue a behaviour (look left or look right).  Current evidence suggests that neurons in the PFC appear to represent precisely this sort of information.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other evidence from single-cell [[electrophysiology]] in monkeys implicates ventrolateral PFC (inferior prefrontal convexity) in the control of motor responses. For example, cells that increase their firing rate to NoGo signals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sakagami|first1=M |last2=Tsutsui|first2=Ki |last3=Lauwereyns|first3=J |last4=Koizumi|first4=M |last5=Kobayashi|first5=S |last6=Hikosaka|first6=O |title=A code for behavioral inhibition on the basis of color, but not motion, in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex of macaque monkey |journal=J.

=== Attentional biasing in sensory regions ===
[[Electrophysiology]] and [[functional neuroimaging]] studies involving [[human]] subjects have been used to describe the neural mechanisms underlying attentional biasing.  Most studies have looked for activation at the 'sites' of biasing, such as in the [[visual cortex|visual]] or [[auditory cortex|auditory cortices]].  Early studies employed [[event-related potential]]s to reveal that electrical brain responses recorded over left and right visual cortex are enhanced when the subject is instructed to attend to the appropriate (contralateral) side of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hillyard|first1=SA |last2=Anllo-Vento|first2=L |title=Event-related brain potentials in the study of visual selective attention |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=781–7 |date=February 1998|pmid=9448241 |pmc=33798 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9448241 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.781|bibcode=1998PNAS...95..781H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of bloodflow-based neuroimaging techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) has more recently permitted the demonstration that neural activity in a number of sensory regions, including [[visual cortex#V4|color-]], [[visual cortex#V5|motion-]], and [[face perception|face-responsive]] regions of visual cortex, is enhanced when subjects are directed to attend to that dimension of a stimulus, suggestive of [[Gain (electronics)|gain control]] in sensory neocortex.   For example, in a typical study, Liu and coworkers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu|first1=T |last2=Slotnick|first2=SD |last3=Serences|first3=JT |last4=Yantis|first4=S |title=Cortical mechanisms of feature-based attentional control |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1334–43 |date=December 2003|pmid=14615298 |url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14615298 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhg080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented subjects with arrays of dots moving to the left or right, presented in either red or green.  Preceding each stimulus, an instruction cue indicated whether subjects should respond on the basis of the colour or the direction of the dots.  Even though colour and motion were present in all stimulus arrays, fMRI activity in [[visual cortex#V4|colour-sensitive regions]] (V4) was enhanced when subjects were instructed to attend to the colour, and activity in [[visual cortex#V5|motion-sensitive regions]] was increased when subjects were cued to attend to the direction of motion.  Several studies have also reported evidence for the biasing signal prior to stimulus onset, with the observation that regions of the frontal cortex tend to come active prior to the onset of an expected stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kastner|first1=S |last2=Pinsk|first2=MA |last3=De Weerd|first3=P |last4=Desimone|first4=R |last5=Ungerleider|first5=LG |title=Increased activity in human visual cortex during directed attention in the absence of visual stimulation |journal=Neuron |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=751–61 |date=April 1999|pmid=10230795 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896-6273(00)80734-5 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80734-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectivity between the PFC and sensory regions ===
Despite the growing currency of the 'biasing' model of executive functions, direct evidence for functional connectivity between the PFC and sensory regions when executive functions are used, is to date rather sparse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1=BT |last2=d'Esposito|first2=M |title=Searching for "the top" in top-down control |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=535–8 |date=November 2005|pmid=16301170 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the only direct evidence comes from studies in which a portion of frontal cortex is damaged, and a corresponding effect is observed far from the lesion site, in the responses of sensory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barceló|first1=F |last2=Suwazono|first2=S |last3=Knight|first3=RT |title=Prefrontal modulation of visual processing in humans |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=399–403 |date=April 2000|pmid=10725931 |doi=10.1038/73975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuster|first1=JM |last2=Bauer|first2=RH |last3=Jervey|first3=JP |title=Functional interactions between inferotemporal and prefrontal cortex in a cognitive task |journal=Brain Res. |volume=330 |issue=2 |pages=299–307 |date=March 1985|pmid=3986545 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(85)90689-4 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(85)90689-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few studies have explored whether this effect is specific to situations where executive functions are required.  Other methods for measuring connectivity between distant brain regions, such as correlation in the fMRI response, have yielded indirect evidence that the frontal cortex and sensory regions communicate during a variety of processes thought to engage executive functions, such as working memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gazzaley|first1=A |last2=Rissman|first2=J |last3=d'Esposito|first3=M |title=Functional connectivity during working memory maintenance |journal=Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=580–99 |date=December 2004|pmid=15849899 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=1530-7026&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=580&amp;aulast=Gazzaley |doi=10.3758/CABN.4.4.580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but more research is required to establish how information flows between the PFC and the rest of the brain when executive functions are used. As an early step in this direction, an fMRI study on the flow of information processing during visuospatial reasoning has provided evidence for causal associations (inferred from the temporal order of activity) between sensory-related activity in occipital and parietal cortices and activity in posterior and anterior PFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shokri-Kojori |first1=E |last2=Motes|first2=MA |last3=Rypma|first3=B |last4=Krawczyk|first4=DC |title=The network architecture of cortical processing in visuo-spatial reasoning |journal=Sci.

=== Bilingualism and executive functions ===
A growing body of research demonstrates that bilinguals show advantages in executive functions, specifically inhibitory control and task switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bialystok |first1=Ellen |title=Bilingualism in development: Language, literacy, and cognition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=2001 |oclc=51202836 |isbn=978-0-511-60596-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Carlson SM, Meltzoff AM 2008 282–298"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson|first1=SM |last2=Meltzoff|first2=AM |title=Bilingual experience and executive functioning in young children |journal=Developmental Science |volume=11 |pages=282–298 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00675.x |pmid=18333982 |issue=2 |pmc=3647884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for this is that speaking two languages requires controlling one's attention and choosing the correct language to speak. Across development, bilingual infants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conboy|first1=BT |last2=Sommerville|first2=JA |last3=Kuhl|first3=PK |title=Cognitive control factors in speech at 11 months |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=44 |pages=1505–1512 |year=2008 |doi=10.1037/a0012975 |pmid=18793082 |issue=5 |pmc=2562344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; children,&lt;ref name="Carlson SM, Meltzoff AM 2008 282–298" /&gt; and elderly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bialystok|first1=E |last2=Craik|first2=FIM |last3=Klein|first3=R |last4=Viswanathan|first4=M |title=Bilingualism, aging, and cognitive control: Evidence from the Simon task |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=19 |pages=290–303 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1037/0882-7974.19.2.290 |pmid= 15222822 |issue=2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.524.3897 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show a bilingual advantage when it comes to executive functioning. Bimodal bilinguals, or people who speak one oral language and one sign language, do not demonstrate this bilingual advantage in executive functioning tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emmorey |first1=K |last2=Luk |first2=G |last3=Pyers |first3=JE |last4=Bialystok |first4=E |title=The source of enhanced cognitive control in bilinguals |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1201–1206 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02224.x|pmid=19121123 |pmc=2677184|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12122308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because one is not required to actively inhibit one language in order to speak the other.
Bilingual individuals also seem to have an advantage in an area known as conflict processing, which occurs when there are multiple representations of one particular response (for example, a word in one language and its translation in the individual's other language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=A |last2=Hernandez |first2=M |last3=Sebastian-Galles |first3=N |title=Bilingualism aids conflict resolution: Evidence from the ANT task |journal=Cognition |volume=106 |pages=59–86 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.013 |pmid=17275801 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] has been shown to be involved with conflict processing. However, there are still some doubts. In a meta-analytic review, researchers concluded that bilingualism did not enhance executive functioning in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehtonen|first=Minna|last2=Soveri|first2=Anna|last3=Laine|first3=Aini|last4=Järvenpää|first4=Janica|last5=de Bruin|first5=Angela|last6=Antfolk|first6=Jan|date=April 2018|title=Is bilingualism associated with enhanced executive functioning in adults?

==In disease or disorder==
The study of executive function in [[Parkinson's disease]] suggests subcortical areas such as the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]] and [[basal ganglia]] are important in these processes.  [[Dopamine]] modulation of the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the efficacy of dopaminergic drugs on executive function, and gives rise to the [[Yerkes-Dodson law|Yerkes Dodson Curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leh|first1=Sandra E|last2=Petrides|first2=Michael|last3=Strafella|first3=Antonio P|title=The Neural Circuitry of Executive Functions in Healthy Subjects and Parkinson's Disease|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=16 February 2017|volume=35|issue=1|pages=70–85|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.88|issn=0893-133X|pmid=19657332|pmc=3055448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inverted U represents decreased executive functioning with excessive arousal (or increased catecholamine release during stress), and decreased executive functioning with insufficient arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robbins|first1=T.W.|last2=Arnsten|first2=A.F.T.|title=The Neuropsychopharmacology of Fronto-Executive Function: Monoaminergic Modulation|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|date=1 January 2009|volume=32|pages=267–287|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.051508.135535|issn=0147-006X|pmid=19555290|pmc=2863127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The low activity polymorphism of [[Catechol-O-methyltransferase]] is associated with slight increase in performance on executive function tasks in healthy persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=J. H.|last2=Jones|first2=P. B.|last3=Robbins|first3=T. W.|last4=Müller|first4=U.|title=Effects of the catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism on executive function: a meta-analysis of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test in schizophrenia and healthy controls|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=27 February 2007|volume=12|issue=5|pages=502–509|doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001973|pmid=17325717|url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n5/full/4001973a.html|language=en|issn=1359-4184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Executive functions are impaired in multiple disorders include [[anxiety disorder]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[schizophrenia]] and [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosenbocus|first1=Sheik|last2=Chahal|first2=Raj|title=A Review of Executive Function Deficits and Pharmacological Management in Children and Adolescents|journal=Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|date=16 February 2017|volume=21|issue=3|pages=223–229|issn=1719-8429|pmc=3413474|pmid=22876270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesions to the prefrontal cortex, such as in the case of [[Phineas Gage]], may also result in deficits of executive function.  Damage to these areas may also manifest in deficits of other areas of function, such as [[motivation]], and [[social functioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szczepanski|first1=Sara M.|last2=Knight|first2=Robert T.|title=Insights into Human Behavior from Lesions to the Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Neuron|volume=83|issue=5|pages=1002–1018|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.08.011|pmid=25175878|pmc=4156912|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future directions ==
Other important evidence for executive functions processes in the prefrontal cortex have been described.  One widely cited review article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ridderinkhof|first1=KR |last2=Ullsperger|first2=M |last3=Crone|first3=EA |last4=Nieuwenhuis|first4=S |title=The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control |journal=Science |volume=306 |issue=5695 |pages=443–7 |date=October 2004|pmid=15486290 |doi=10.1126/science.1100301 |bibcode=2004Sci...306..443R |hdl=1871/17182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the role of the medial part of the PFC in situations where executive functions are likely to be engaged – for example, where it is important to detect errors, identify situations where stimulus conflict may arise, make decisions under uncertainty, or when a reduced probability of obtaining favourable performance outcomes is detected.  This review, like many others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Botvinick|first1=MM |last2=Braver|first2=TS |last3=Barch|first3=DM |last4=Carter|first4=CS |last5=Cohen|first5=JD |title=Conflict monitoring and cognitive control |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=624–52 |date=July 2001|pmid=11488380 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/108/3/624 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlights interactions between [[prefrontal cortex|medial and lateral PFC]], whereby posterior medial frontal cortex signals the need for increased executive functions and sends this signal on to areas in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that actually implement control. Yet there has been no compelling evidence at all that this view is correct, and, indeed, one article showed that patients with lateral PFC damage had reduced ERNs (a putative sign of dorsomedial monitoring/error-feedback)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gehring |first1=WJ |last2=Knight|first2=RT |title=Prefrontal-cingulate interactions in action monitoring |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=516–20 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10769394 |doi=10.1038/74899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – suggesting, if anything, that the direction of flow of the control could be in the reverse direction. Another prominent theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koechlin|first1=E |last2=Ody|first2=C |last3=Kouneiher|first3=F |title=The architecture of cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5648 |pages=1181–5 |date=November 2003|pmid=14615530 |doi=10.1126/science.1088545 |bibcode=2003Sci...302.1181K |citeseerx=10.1.1.71.8826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises that interactions along the perpendicular axis of the frontal cortex, arguing that a 'cascade' of interactions between anterior PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and [[premotor cortex]] guides behaviour in accordance with past context, present context, and current sensorimotor associations, respectively.

Advances in [[neuroimaging]] techniques have allowed studies of genetic links to executive functions, with the goal of using the imaging techniques as potential [[endophenotype]]s for discovering the genetic causes of executive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biol Psychol |year=2007 |title=Imaging the genetics of executive function |last1=Greene|first1=CM |last2=Braet|first2=W |last3=Johnson|first3=KA |last4=Bellgrove|first4=MA |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.11.009 |pmid=18178303 |volume=79 |pages=30–42 |issue=1 |hdl=10197/6121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More research is required to develop interventions that can improve executive functions and help people generalize those skills to daily activities and settings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Adele|last2=Ling|first2=Daphne S.|date=2016-04-01|title=Conclusions about interventions, programs, and approaches for improving executive functions that appear justified and those that, despite much hype, do not|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929315300517|journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience|series=Flux Congress 2014|volume=18|pages=34–48|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2015.11.005|pmc=5108631|pmid=26749076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">{{Other uses|Falling (disambiguation){{!}}Falling}}A [[sense|sensation]] of '''falling''' occurs when the [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|labyrinth]] or ''vestibular apparatus'', a system of fluid-filled passages in the [[ear|inner ear]], detects changes in acceleration. This sensation can occur when a person begins to fall, which in terms of [[mechanics]] amounts to a sudden acceleration increase from zero to [[Gravitational acceleration|roughly 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. If the body is in [[free fall]] (for example, during [[skydiving]]) with no other momenta (rotation, etc.) there is no falling sensation. This almost never occurs in real-life falling situations because when the faller leaves their support there are usually very significant quantities of residual momenta such as rotation and these momenta continue as the person falls, causing a sensation of dysphoria. The faller doesn't fall straight down but spins, flips, etc. due to these residual momenta and also due to the asymmetric forces of air resistance on his asymmetric body. While velocity continues to increase, the downward acceleration due to [[gravity]] remains constant. Increasing [[Drag (physics)|drag force]] may even cause a feeling of ascent.

The vestibular apparatus also detects spatial orientation with respect to visual input.  A similar sensation of falling can be induced when the eyes detect rapid apparent motion with respect to the environment.  This system enables people to keep their balance by signalling when a physical correction is necessary. Some medical conditions, known as [[balance disorder]]s, also induce the sensation of falling. In the [[hypnagogia|early stages of sleep]], a falling sensation may be perceived in connection with a [[hypnic jerk]], sometimes awaking the sleeper abruptly.

== Labyrinth ==
The [[vestibular system]] works with other sensorimotor systems in the body, such as the visual system (eyes) and skeletal system (bones and joints), to check and maintain the position of our body at rest or in motion. The vestibular apparatus functions by detecting forces that act upon bodies including gravity. There are two sections in the labyrinth that are helpful for accomplishing those tasks: the semicircular canals and the otolithic organs.

==Balance disorder==

A [[balance disorder]] is a condition that makes a person feel nausea, disorientation or dizziness, as if moving, spinning or falling even though steady.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Balance Disorders|url = http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/balance/pages/balance_disorders.aspx|website = www.nidcd.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-01|date = April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balance disorder can be caused by medication, problems of inner ear or the brain.

==Hypnic jerk==
[[Hypnic jerk]], also called a boggie jerk, is a normal reaction that can be caused by anxiety, caffeine, a dream, or discomfort of sleeping. A hypnic jerk is the feeling triggered by a sudden muscle twitch, causing the feeling of falling while sleeping or dreaming. People normally experience hypnic jerks moments before the first stage of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are Hypnagogic Jerks? Twitches Before Sleep.|url = http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/05/19/what-are-hypnagogic-jerks-twitches-before-sleep/|website = mentalhealthdaily.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 70% of people have experienced hypnic jerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Do People 'Twitch' When Falling Asleep?|url = http://www.livescience.com/39225-why-people-twitch-falling-asleep.html|accessdate = 2015-10-01|last = Castro|date = August 27, 2013|first = Joesph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnic jerks are most common in children, when dreams are considered the most simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why your body jerks before you fall asleep|url = http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120522-suffer-from-sleep-shudders|website = www.bbc.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01|first = Tom|last = Stafford|date = May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no completely accurate explanation of this phenomenon, but most experts{{who|date=January 2013}} agree that as muscles begin to slacken right after one falls asleep, the brain senses these relaxation signals and misinterpret as one is falling down. Then the brain will send signals to muscles to keep the balance.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Studies{{which|date=January 2013}} showed that there is a correlation between the frequency of hypnic jerks and anxiety. Fatigue, discomfort of the bed, highly intense exercise and stress might cause people to jerk during sleeping.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}

'''Genetypes''' is a taxonomic concept proposed in 2010 to describe any [[genetic sequence|genetic sequences]] from [[type (biology)|type specimens]].&lt;ref name=Chakrabarty2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Prosanta|title=Genetypes: a concept to help integrate molecular systematics and traditional taxonomy|journal=Zootaxa|year=2010|volume=2632|pages=67–68|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/zt02632p068.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisonetal2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=I.

This nomenclature is designed to label, or flag, genetic sequences that were sampled from type specimens. The nomenclature of genetypes proposes that genetic sequences from a [[holotype]] should be referred to as a “hologenetype” (from: '''holo'''type and '''genetype'''), sequences from a topotype will be a “topogenetype,” and so forth. In addition, the genetic marker(s) used should also be incorporated into the nomenclature (e.g., paragenetype ND2).

The genetypes nomenclatural system could be used to flag “gold standard” sequences that due to their direct link to type specimens will be more credible than standard sequences whose species identification may be problematic. Misidentifications plague many sequences on [[GenBank]]{{cn|date=December 2013}} and having some sequences that are linked to type specimens will help locate and manage misidentifications and to create positively identified "gold standard" sequences available for comparison. It is suggested that this nomenclature be used in publications and databases that display or discuss sequences from type specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFB Instruction to Authors |url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=0022-1112 |publisher=Journal of Fish Biology }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisonetal2011/&gt;

The genetypes concept was superseded by the [[GenSeq]] concept, proposed in 2013 due to some confusion among researchers that genetypes were equivalent to [[name-bearing type]]s.&lt;ref name=Chakrabarty2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Prosanta|author2=Warren, Melanie |author3=Page, Lawrence |author4= Baldwin, Carole |title=GenSeq: An updated nomenclature and ranking for genetic sequences from type and non-type sources|journal=ZooKeys|year=2013|volume=346|pages=29–41|doi=10.3897/zookeys.346.5753|pmid=24223486 |pmc=3821064}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|reason=What does "genetypes were equivalent to name-bearing types" mean?|date=February 2014}}

== Overview ==
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of [[Geology of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Geology of Tasmania|Tasmania]]) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a [[Geoethics|geoethical]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peppoloni S. and Di Capua G. (2012), "[http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/6099 Geoethics and geological culture: awareness, responsibility and challenges]". Annals of Geophysics, 55, 3, 335-341. doi: 10.4401/ag-6099.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to José Brilha geodiversity may be of scientific value or valued for other aspects. Geodiversity of scientific value can be either geosites or geoheritage elements that are ''[[ex situ]]''. Similarly geodiversity that is of little or no scientific value may be categorized as sites of geodiversity or geodiversity elements that are ''ex situ''.&lt;ref name=Brilha2014/&gt;

[[Image:Acer palmatum BotGartenMuenster Faecherahorn 6691.jpg|right|225px|thumb|This [[cultivar]] of [[Japanese maple]] has a [[dome]]-like habit.]]
'''Habit''' is equivalent to '''habitus''' in some applications in [[biology]]; the term refers variously to aspects of behaviour or structure, as follows: 
*In [[zoology]] (particularly in [[ethology]]), '''habit''' usually refers to aspects of more or less predictable ''behaviour'', [[instinct]]ive or otherwise, though it also has broader application. '''Habitus''' refers to the characteristic form or morphology of a species.
*In botany '''habit''' is the characteristic form in which a given species of [[plant]] grows (see [[Glossary of plant morphology#Plant habit]]).&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==
In [[zoology]], ''habit'' (not to be confused with ''habitus'' as described below) usually refers to a specific [[behavior]] pattern, either adopted, [[Learning|learned]], pathological, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate]], or directly related to [[physiology]]. For example:
* ...the [cat] was in the ''habit'' of springing upon the [door knocker] in order to gain admission...&lt;ref name="ChambersChambers1835"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Chambers|author2=Robert Chambers|title=Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|year=1835|publisher=W. Orr|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If these sensitive parrots are kept in cages, they quickly take up the ''habit'' of feather plucking.&lt;ref name="LantermannVriends1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Lantermann|author2=Matthew M. Vriends|title=New Parrot Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ilp6E-rV4NYC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1986|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-8120-3729-6|pages=110–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[spider monkey]] has an [[arboreal]] ''habit'' and rarely ventures onto the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|forest]] floor.
* The [[brittlestar]] has the ''habit'' of breaking off arms as a means of [[Antipredator adaptation|defense]].

''Mode of life'' (or ''lifestyle'', ''modus vivendi'') is a concept related to ''habit'', and it sometimes is referred to as the ''habit'' of an animal. It may refer to the [[animal locomotion|locomotor]] capabilities, as in "([[motile]] ''habit''", [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], errant, sedentary), [[feeding behaviour]] and mechanisms, nutrition mode (free-living, [[parasitic nutrition|parasitic]], [[holozoic nutrition|holozoic]], [[saprotrophic]], [[Primary nutritional groups|trophic type]]), type of [[habitat]] ([[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[arboreal]], [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]], [[marine biology|marine]], freshwater, seawater, [[benthos|benthic]], [[pelagic]], [[nektonic]], [[planktonic]], etc.),  period of activity ([[Diurnality|diurnal]], [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]), types of [[ecological interaction]], etc.

The habits of plants and animals often change in response to changes in their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. For example: if a species develops a disease or there is a drastic change of habitat or local climate, or it is removed to a different region, then the normal habits may change. Such changes may be either [[Wiktionary:pathological|pathological]], or [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wynne|first=Parry|title=Disease May Help Shape Animals' Migration Habits|url=http://www.livescience.com/10441-disease-shape-animals-migration-habits.html|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In [[botany]], habit is the general appearance, growth form, or [[plant architecture|architecture]]. For example:
* Many species of [[maple]] have a [[shrub]]by ''habit'' and may form [[shrub|bushes]] or [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]]s rather than [[tree]]s.
* Certain [[alpine plants]] have been chosen for [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] because of their [[dwarfing|dwarf]] ''habit''.

Plants may be [[woody plant|woody]] or [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]]. The main types of woody plants are [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s. Climbing plants ([[vine]]s) can be woody (lianas) or herbaceous (nonwoody vines). Plants can also be categorized in terms of their ''habit'' as [[subshrub]]s (dwarf shrub, bush), [[cushion plant]]s and [[succulent]]s.

There is some overlap between the classifications of plants according to their habit and their [[plant life-form|life-form]].

Other terms in biology refer similarly to various [[Taxon|taxa]]; for example:
* [[Fungi]] are described by their ''growth patterns'': [[mold]]s, [[yeast]]s, [[mushroom]]s and [[dimorphic fungi]]. 
* [[Lichen]]s structure is described their ''growth form'': foliose, [[crustose]], fruticose or gelatinous.
* [[Bryophyte]]s structure is described as foliose or [[thallose]].
* The structure of a given species of [[algae]] is referred to as its ''type'' or ''{{Interlanguage link multi|level of organization|de|3=Organisationsstufe}}''. 
* [[Bacteria]] are described by their ''[[Bacterial cellular morphologies|morphology]]'' or ''shape''. 
* [[Animal]] structure is described by  its ''[[body plan]]'', which encompasses the [[body symmetry]], the type of [[germ layer]]s and of [[body cavity|body cavities]].

Since the distinction between the concepts – mode of behavior and [[Morphology (biology)|morphological form]] – are significant in zoology, the term ''habitus'' (from which the word ''habit'' derives) is used to describe form as distinct from behaviour (''habit''). The term ''habitus'' also occurs in botanical texts, but there it is used almost interchangeably with ''habit'', because plant behaviour generally does not correspond closely to the concept of habits in the zoological sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">'''Health Web Science''' ('''HWS''') is a sub-discipline of [[Web science|Web Science]] that examines the interplay between health sciences, health and well-being, and the Web. It assumes that each domain influences the others. HWS thus complements and overlaps with [[Health 2.0|Medicine 2.0]] (medicine enabled by emerging technologies).&lt;ref&gt;McHattie LS, Cumming G, French T. Transforming Patient Experience: Health Web Science Meets Medicine 2.0 Med 2.0 2014;3(1):e2 URL:http://www.medicine20.com/2014/1/e2 DOI: 10.2196/med20.3128.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has uncovered [[emergent properties]] that arise as individuals interact with each other, with healthcare providers and with the Web itself.

==History==
HWS began at the Web Science Curriculum meeting in the summer of 2010 at the University of Southampton where approximately forty scholars came together to discuss the subject. That was followed by a foundational Workshop in Koblenz 2011 under the aegis of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Elizabeth H.|last2=Cumming|first2=Grant P.|last3=Luciano|first3=Joanne S.|date=2011-01-01|title=Health Web Science: Application of Web Science to the Area of Health Education and Health Care|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2064741.2064746|journal=Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Web Science and Information Exchange in the Medical Web|series=MedEx '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=11–14|doi=10.1145/2064741.2064746|isbn=9781450309509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/|title=ACM|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue to more precisely define HWS as a sub-discipline of Web Science began among Web-oriented investigators at the 2012 Medicine 2.0 Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicine20congress.com/ocs/index.php/med/med2012|title=Medicine 2.0'12 (Boston, USA)|website=www.medicine20congress.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Joanne S.|last2=Cumming|first2=Grant P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Mark D.|last4=Kahana|first4=Eva|date=2013-01-01|title=The emergent discipline of health web science|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e166|doi=10.2196/jmir.2499|issn=1438-8871|pmc=3758025|pmid=23968998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Joanne S.|last2=Cumming|first2=Grant P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Mark D.|last4=Kahana|first4=Eva|date=2013-01-01|title=The emergent discipline of health web science|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e166|doi=10.2196/jmir.2499|issn=1438-8871|pmc=3758025|pmid=23968998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nascent discipline of Health Web Science is further described and developed in the monograph "Health Web Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Joanne S.|title=Health Web Science|url=http://www.nowpublishers.com/articles/foundations-and-trends-in-web-science/WEB-019|journal=Foundations and Trends® in Web Science|volume=4|issue=4|pages=269–419|doi=10.1561/1800000019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A call to action at the ACM Web Science workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.websci13.org/workshops/wk9-life-web-science-workshop/|title=WK9 - Life Web Science Workshop - ACM Web Science 2013|website=www.websci13.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked the community to consider how to accelerate the discipline. In particular, beyond the available knowledge-gathering technologies (e.g. [[blogs]], social-medicine portals, experience mining, [[graph theory]], [[Network theory|network analysis]], and [[game theory]]), what additional is required to deal with the Health Web's emergent properties? For example, what is needed to curate, interrogate, and visualize the combination of both '[[Big Data]]' – arising from the increasingly pervasive sources and sensors including "the [[Internet of Things|Internet of things]], the [[Quantified Self|quantified self]], [[smart cities]], and smart homes – and smaller-scale data arising from individual patient conversations, self-reporting, and self-exploration? How are small-scale innovations safely and efficiently scaled up to the size of the Web and scaled out to millions of patients?&lt;ref&gt;Gillam et al.

One research group argued for technologies that enable predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory (P4) medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=Leroy|last2=Friend|first2=Stephen H.|title=Predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory (P4) cancer medicine|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227|journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology|volume=8|issue=3|pages=184–187|doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stated needs include an "Expert Patient" capable of making sense of online medical information in a personal context, tools to cope with information overload through e.g., [[text mining]] and semantic technologies, in particular through algorithm-aided decision making.

=== Health web observatory ===
At the Medicine 2.0 European meeting in 2014, the case was made for the need to design bespoke health web observatories. The Web Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webscience.org/|title=Web Science Trust|website=Web Science Trust|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of a Web observatory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webscience.org/web-observatory/|title=Web Observatory|website=Web Science Trust|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an integrated collection of data sources and analysis tools that enables observation and experimentation for Web study,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Wendy and Tiropanis, Thanassis (2012) Web Evolution and Web Science. Computer Networks, 56, (18), 3859-3865. Eprints:http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/343770/&lt;/ref&gt; and positioned it to bridge the gap between big data analytics and the data.&lt;ref&gt;Tiropanis, T, Hall, W, Shadbolt N, De Roure, David Contractor N, Hendler J.

An '''ideal''' is a [[principle]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] that one actively pursues as a [[goal]], usually in the context of [[ethics]], and one's prioritization of ideals can serve to indicate the extent of one's dedication to each. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]], but is willing to [[lie]] to protect a friend, demonstrates not only devotion to [[friendship]], but also belief in its supersedence of honesty in importance.

The belief in ideals is called '''ethical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry into the Nature and Function of Ideals|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=0520078888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied ethics==
In some theories of [[applied ethics]], such as that of [[Rushworth Kidder]], there is importance given to such orders as a way to [[dispute resolution|resolve disputes]].  In [[law]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness.

==In politics==
In [[politics]] ideals play a pivotal role.  During the [[French Revolution]], the principles of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood]]" were raised to the status of ideals. The [[Green_Party_of_the_United_States#Ideology|Ten Key Values of the US Green Party]] are likewise raised to such status today. In fact, most political movements have a certain set of ideals. However, in many cases, one can easily find instances where ideals were "not lived up to" - some of which are cases where one simply proved to outweigh another for some specific decision, or where all were compromised simply to retain the [[power (sociology)|power]] to continue to pursue them.

==Idols and heroes==
A different form of ideal is an [[idolatry|idol]] or [[hero]], who is held up as a [[moral example]].  Since this is an actual person or fictional character, it is too complex and multi-faceted to be considered an ideal in the abstract sense. However, when they are encountered in the form of a story, with only a few traits on display, they are a simplified [[archetype]] from which one can very easily derive [[stereotype]]s or mimicry.  In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of [[Muhammad]] is held up as "ideal", but must be interpreted for believers through the tale of his life, or [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], and his many sayings, the [[hadith]].

==Ideal and virtue==
Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, and resolving conflicts between them, it is not uncommon to see them reduced to [[dogma]]. One way to avoid this, according to [[Bernard Crick]], is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a process, rather than an outcome.  His [[political virtues]] try to raise the practical habits useful in resolving disputes into ideals of their own.  A [[virtue]], in general, is an ideal that one can make a [[habituation|habit]].

==Relative ideal==
In formal axiology, [[Robert S. Hartman]] contended that being ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as "good" as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In [[ethics]], by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.

'''Illegal immigration''' refers to the [[wikt:migration|migration]] of people into a country in ways that violate the [[immigration law]]s of that country, or the remaining in a country of people who no longer have the legal right to remain. 

Illegal immigration, as well as [[immigration]] in general, is overwhelmingly financially upward, from a poorer to a richer country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark|last=Taylor|title=The Drivers of Immigration in Contemporary Society: Unequal Distribution of Resources and Opportunities|work=Human Ecology|volume=35|number=6|date=December 2007|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3194641502768341|accessdate=10 December 2009|doi=10.1007/s10745-007-9111-z|pages=775–776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in another country illegally includes a variety of restrictions, as well as the risk of being detained and deported or of facing other sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=V.

Asylum seekers who were denied asylum may face [[impediment to expulsion]], for example if the home country refuses to receive the person or if new asylum reasons occur after the decision. In some countries or cases, these people are considered as illegal immigrants, and in others, they may get a temporary residence permit, for example with reference to the principle of [[non-refoulement]] in the international [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Refugee Convention]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]], referring to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], has shown in a number of indicative judgments that there are enforcement barriers to expulsion to certain countries, for example due to the risk of torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"fulltext":["impediment to expulsion"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328055357/http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{ |date=28 March 2017 }},"kpthesaurus":["350"]} Search results on "Impediment to expulsion" in the European Court of Human Rights archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
There have been campaigns in many countries since 2007 discouraging the use of the term "illegal immigrant". They are generally based on the argument that the act of immigrating illegally does not make the people themselves illegal, but rather they are "people who have immigrated illegally". In the [[United States]], a "Drop the I-Word" campaign was launched in 2010 advocating for the use of terms such as '''undocumented immigrants''' or '''unauthorized immigrants''' when referring to the foreign nationals who reside in a country illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colorlines.com/droptheiword/|title=Drop the I-Word Campaign|work=Race Forward|access-date=2 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223051558/http://colorlines.com/droptheiword/|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picum.org/words-matter/|title=Words matter • PICUM|publisher=|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220225318/http://picum.org/words-matter/|archive-date=20 December 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News associations that have discontinued or discourage the use of the adjective "illegal" to describe nouns that describe people include the US [[Associated Press]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ap.org/2013/04/02/illegal-immigrant-no-more/ Illegal Immigrant no more] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822002138/http://blog.ap.org/2013/04/02/illegal-immigrant-no-more/ |date=22 August 2013 }} Associated Press Blog, 2013 April 2&lt;/ref&gt; UK [[Press Association]], [[European Journalism Observatory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nazhmidinova|first=Rukhshona|title=User Generated Racism: Russia’s media and migrants|url=http://en.ejo.ch/8244/ethics_quality/user-generated-racism-russias-media-migrants#more-8244|publisher=The European Journalism Observatory|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505202900/http://en.ejo.ch/8244/ethics_quality/user-generated-racism-russias-media-migrants#more-8244|archive-date=5 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Journalism Centre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How journalism can rid migration of its sour reputation|url=http://ejc.net/magazine/article/how-journalism-can-rid-migration-of-its-sour-reputation#.U2eXWIGSxA0|publisher=European Journalism Centre|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505180957/http://ejc.net/magazine/article/how-journalism-can-rid-migration-of-its-sour-reputation#.U2eXWIGSxA0|archive-date=5 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association of European Journalists]], [[Australian Press Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Asylum seekers', 'illegal immigrants' and entry without a visa|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/advisory-guidelines/|work=Advisory Guidelines 2011|publisher=Australian Press Council|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801075645/http://www.presscouncil.org.au/advisory-guidelines/|archive-date=1 August 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Angela|title=Missing the Boat?

For example, Associated Press continues to use the term "illegal immigration" to describe the action of entering or residing in a country illegally.

In contrast, in some contexts the term "illegal immigrants" is shortened, often pejoratively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/llegals/?_r=0|title=‘Illegals’|access-date=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525114202/https://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/llegals/?_r=0|archive-date=25 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "'''illegals'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html|title=Here’s the Reality About Illegal Immigrants in the United States|last=Yee|first=Vivian|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629024527/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html|archive-date=29 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/07/25/crimes_by_illegals_are_buried_in_amnesty_push|title= Crimes by Illegals are Buried in Amnesty Push|access-date= 4 June 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220220/http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/07/25/crimes_by_illegals_are_buried_in_amnesty_push|archive-date= 14 July 2014|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bazelon |first=Emily |date=23 August 2015 |title=The Unwelcome Return of 'Illegals' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/the-unwelcome-return-of-illegals.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=19 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818140913/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/the-unwelcome-return-of-illegals.html |archive-date=18 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/121-murders-attributed-illegal-immigrants-released/?page=all|title= 121 murders attributed to illegals released by Obama administration|last1= Dinan|first1= Stephen|website= The Washington Times|access-date= 21 August 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150811040145/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/121-murders-attributed-illegal-immigrants-released/?page=all|archive-date= 11 August 2015|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the term '''undocumented''' has been cited by [[The New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Undocumented, Unauthorized: The Terms of Immigration Reporting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/insider/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-the-terms-of-immigration-reporting.html|access-date=10 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310171926/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/insider/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-the-terms-of-immigration-reporting.html|archive-date=10 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "term preferred by many immigrants and their advocates, but it has a flavor of [[euphemism]] and should be used with caution outside quotation". [[Newsweek]] questions the use of the phrase 'undocumented immigrants' as a method of euphemistic [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]], namely, "a psychological technique that can influence the perception of social phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Say ‘Illegal Alien.’ I Say ‘Undocumented Immigrant.’ Who’s Right?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/you-say-illegal-alien-i-say-undocumented-immigrant-whos-right-750644|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325231936/http://www.newsweek.com/you-say-illegal-alien-i-say-undocumented-immigrant-whos-right-750644|archive-date=25 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsweek also suggests that persons who enter a country unlawfully cannot be entirely "undocumented" because they "just lack the certain specific documents for legal residency and employment. Many have drivers licenses, debit cards, library cards, and school identifications which are useful documents in specific contexts but not nearly so much for immigration." For example, in the U.S., youths brought into the country illegally are granted access to public K-12 education and benefits regardless of citizenship status,&lt;ref name="Gonzales"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=Roberto G.|year=2011|title=Learning to Be Illegal:  Undocumented Youth and Shifting Legal Contexts in the Transition to Adulthood|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|publisher=[[American Sociological Association]]|volume=76|issue=4|pages=602–619|doi=10.1177/0003122411411901|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf|accessdate=March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000648/http://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Aug11ASRFeature.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the youths are documented for educational purposes, and are not entirely undocumented. U.S. immigration laws do use the phrase '''illegal immigrant''' at least in some contexts.

A related term, '''irregular migration''', is sometimes used e.g. by the [[International Organization for Migration]], but it describes a somewhat wider concept which also includes illegal emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iom.int/key-migration-terms|title=Key Migration Terms|date=14 January 2015|publisher=|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112042555/https://www.iom.int/key-migration-terms|archive-date=12 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal immigration vs unauthorized immigration===
Overstaying a visa is a [[civil violation]] handled by [[immigration court]], while entering (including re-entering) the US without approval from an immigration officer is a crime: specifically a [[misdemeanor]] on the first offense. Illegal reentry after deportation is a federal offense. This is the distinction between the larger group referred to as '''unauthorized immigrants''' and the smaller subgroup referred to as '''criminal immigrants'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[CNN]] |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/undocumented-immigrants-not-necessarily-criminal/index.html |title=Are undocumented immigrants committing a crime? Not necessarily |first=Laura |last=Jarrett |date=24 February 2017 |quote=Under federal law, it is a crime for anyone to enter into the US without the approval of an immigration officer -- it's a misdemeanor offense that carries fines and no more than six months in prison. Many foreign nationals, however, enter the country legally every day on valid work or travel visas, and end up overstaying for a variety of reasons. But that's not a violation of federal criminal law -- it's a civil violation that gets handled in immigration court proceedings.&lt;br&gt;So although there are more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the US, they haven't all committed a crime just by being in the country. |access-date=11 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704035122/https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/undocumented-immigrants-not-necessarily-criminal/index.html |archive-date=4 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|bolded terminology is not contained in cited source - July 2018|date=July 2018}}

According to economist [[George Borjas]], immigrants may have caused the decline of real wages of US workers without a high school degree by 9% between 1980 and 2000 due to increased competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George|last=Borjas|title=The Labor Demand Curve is Downward Sloping: Reexamining the Impact of Immigration on the Labor Market|work=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=118|number=4|pages=1335–1374|year=2003 |doi=10.1162/003355303322552810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists, such as [[Gordon Hanson]] and [[Douglas Massey]], criticized this view, and said that it is oversimplified and does not account for contradictory evidence, such as the low net illegal immigration from Mexico to the US before the 1980s despite significant economic disparity.&lt;ref name="logic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/ImmigrationCSR26.pdf|title=The Economic Logic of Illegal Immigration.

Since the decline of working class [[blue-collar]] jobs in manufacturing and industry, younger native-born generations have acquired higher education. In the US, only 12% of the labor force has less than a high school education, but 70% of illegal workers from Mexico lack a high school degree.&lt;ref name="logic"/&gt; The majority of new blue-collar jobs qualify as Massey's "underclass" work, and suffer from unreliability, subservient roles and, critically, a lack of potential for advancement. These "underclass" jobs, which have a disproportionate number of undocumented immigrants, include harvesting crops, unskilled labor in landscaping and construction, house-cleaning, and maid and [[busboy]] work in hotels and restaurants. However, as even these "underclass" jobs have higher relative wages than those in home countries they are still attractive for undocumented immigrants and since many undocumented immigrants often anticipate working only temporarily in the destination country, the lack of opportunity for advancement is seen by many as less of a problem. Support for this claim can be seen in a Pew Hispanic Center poll of over 3,000 undocumented immigrants from Mexico in the US, which found that 79% would voluntarily join a [[temporary worker]] program that allowed them to work legally for several years but then required them to leave.&lt;ref name="pew survey"&gt;{{cite web|first=Roberto|last=Suro|title=Survey of Mexican Migrants, Part One: Attitudes about Immigration and Major Demographic Characteristics|work=Pew Hispanic Center|date=2 March 2005|url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/41.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211132206/http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/41.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it is assumed that the willingness to take undesirable jobs is what gives undocumented immigrants their employment.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; Evidence for this may be seen in the average wages of illegal day laborers in California, which was between $10 and $12 per hour according to a 2005 study, and the fact that this was higher than many entry-level white collar or service jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Abel|last1=Valenzuela, Jr.|first2=Nik|last2=Theodore|first3=Edwin|last3=Meléndez|first4=Ana Luz|last4=Gonzalez|title=On the Corner: Day Labor in the US|work=UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty|date=January 2006|accessdate=11 December 2009|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/issr/csup/uploaded_files/Natl_DayLabor-On_the_Corner1.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010012928/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/issr/csup/uploaded_files/Natl_DayLabor-On_the_Corner1.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entry-level white collar and service jobs offer advancement opportunities only for people with work permits and citizenship.

Research{{which?|date=September 2018}} indicates that the advantage to firms employing undocumented immigrants increases as more firms in the industry do so, further increases with the breadth{{clarify|reason=What is market breadth?|date=September 2018}} of a firm's market, and also with the labor intensity of the firm's production process. However, the advantage decreases with the skill level of the firm's workers, meaning that illegal immigrants do not provide as much competitive advantage when a high-skilled workforce is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/pubs/wp/wp1202a.pdf |title=Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ''Does Employing Undocumented Workers Give Firms a Competitive Advantage?'', November 2012 |access-date=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412073407/http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/pubs/wp/wp1202a.pdf |archive-date=12 April 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for illegal immigration==

===Trade liberalization===
In recent years, developing countries have pursued the benefits of [[globalization]] by adopting measures to liberalize trade. But rapid opening of domestic markets may lead to displacement of large numbers of agricultural or unskilled workers, who are more likely to seek employment and a higher quality of life by illegal immigration.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Poverty===
Undocumented immigrants are not impoverished by standards of their home countries. The poorest classes in a developing country may lack the resources needed to mount an attempt to cross illegally, or the connections to friends or family already in the destination country. Studies from the Pew Hispanic Center have shown that the education and wage levels of illegal Mexican immigrants in the US are around the median for Mexico and that they are not a suitable predictor of one's choice to immigrate.&lt;ref name="pew survey"/&gt;

Other examples do show that increases in poverty, especially when associated with immediate crises, can increase the likelihood of illegal migration. The [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], subsequent to the start of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), was associated with widespread poverty and a lower valuation for the peso relative to the dollar.&lt;ref name="pietro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epriee.ncl.ac.uk/dipietro.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217070854/http://www.epriee.ncl.ac.uk/dipietro.pdf |archivedate=17 February 2005|title=Trade, Legal, and Illegal Immigration|publisher=University of Westminster|author=Giorgio di Pietro}}{{dubious|date=March 2012}} Accessed 11 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It also marked the start of a massive swell in Mexican immigration, in which net illegal migration to the US increased every year from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s.

There are also examples where [[natural disasters]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] can amplify [[poverty]]-driven migration flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=59616|title=Ethiopia: High population growth could slow development|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=4 March 2012|work=IRIN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611185946/http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=59616|archive-date=11 June 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family reunification in new country of residence===
Some undocumented immigrants seek to live with loved ones, such as a spouse or other family members.&lt;ref name="washpost1"&gt;{{cite news|first=N.

Having family who have immigrated or being from a community with many immigrants is a much better predictor of one's choice to immigrate than poverty.&lt;ref name="pew survey"/&gt; Family reunification visas may be applied for by legal residents or naturalized citizens to bring their family members into a destination state legally, but these visas may be limited in number and subject to yearly quotas. This may result in family members entering illegally in order to reunify. From studying Mexican migration patterns, Douglas Massey finds that the likelihood that a Mexican national will emigrate illegally to the US increases dramatically if they have one or more family members already residing in the United States, legally or illegally.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;

===Wars and asylum===
[[File:20101009 Arrested refugees immigrants in Fylakio detention center Thrace Evros Greece restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Arrested refugees-immigrants in Fylakio detention center, Evros, Greece.]]
[[Unauthorised arrival]] into another country may be prompted by the need to escape civil war or [[Political repression|repression]] in the country of origin. However, somebody who flees such a situation is in most countries under no circumstances an undocumented immigrant. If victims of forced displacement apply for asylum in the country they fled to and are granted refugee status they have the right to remain permanently. If [[asylum seekers]] are not granted some kind of legal protection status, then they may have to leave the country, or stay as illegal immigrants.

According to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] [[refugees]] should be exempted from immigration laws and should expect protection from the country they entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm|title=Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|date= 28 July 1951|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=19 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725074145/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |archivedate=25 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, up to the countries involved to decide if a particular immigrant is a refugee or not, and hence whether they are subject to the immigration controls. Furthermore, countries that did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention or do not attempt to follow its guidelines are likely to consider refugees and asylum seekers as illegal immigrants.

===Deprivation of citizenship===

In a 2012 news story, the [[Common Sense Media|''CSM'']] reported, "The estimated 750,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]], one of the most miserable and oppressed minorities in the world, are deeply resentful of their almost complete absence of civil rights in [[Myanmar]].

In some countries, people born on national territory (henceforth not "immigrants") do not automatically obtain the nationality of their birthplace, and may have no legal title of residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://149.101.23.2/graphics/publicaffairs/factsheets/948.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070503023041/http://149.101.23.2/graphics/publicaffairs/factsheets/948.htm |archivedate=3 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems faced by illegal immigrants==
Aside from the possibility that they may be intercepted and deported, illegal immigrants also face other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/migration-exploitation-illegal-labor-domestic-servitude-sex|title=Spheres of Exploitation: Thwarting Actors Who Profit from Illegal Labor, Domestic Servitude, and Sex Work|author=Meghan Benton|authors=|date=January 2014|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|page=|docket=|quote=|author-link=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of access to services===
Illegal immigrants usually have no or very limited access to [[public health]] systems, proper housing, [[education]] and [[bank]]s. Some immigrants [[forgery|forge]] identity documents  to get the access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=98736 |title=World´S Top Teaching Award In Medieval Studies Goes To Fsu Professor |publisher=American Chronicle |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194755/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=98736 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{main article|Human Trafficking}}
After the end of the legal international [[slave trade]] by the Europeans and the United States in the early 19th century, the illegal importation of [[slave]]s has continued, albeit at much reduced levels.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} For example, research at [[San Diego State University]] estimates that there are 2.4 million victims of human trafficking among illegal Mexican immigrants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/240223.pdf |title=Looking for a Hidden Population: Trafficking of Migrant Laborers in San Diego County |access-date=1 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729070836/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/240223.pdf |archive-date=29 July 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not as common as in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, some women are smuggled into the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/09/23_16691.shtml|title=Modern slavery thriving in the U.S.|first=Janet|last=Gilmore|date=23 September 2004|work=UC Berkeley News|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018163408/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/09/23_16691.shtml|archive-date=18 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have been kidnapped or tricked into slavery to work as laborers, after entering the country, for example in factories. Those trafficked in this manner often face additional barriers to escaping slavery, since their status as undocumented immigrants makes it difficult for them to gain access to help or services. For example, [[Burma|Burmese]] women trafficked into Thailand and forced to work in factories or as prostitutes may not speak the language and may be vulnerable to abuse by police due to their undocumented immigrant status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bales |first = Kevin |authorlink = Kevin Bales |title = Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy |publisher = University of California Press |year= 1999 |isbn = 0-520-22463-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping and ransoms===
In some regions, people that are still en route to their destination country are also sometimes kidnapped, for example for [[ransom]]. In some instances, they are also [[torture]]d, [[rape]]d, and killed if the requested ransom does not arrive. One case in point are the [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritrean]] migrants that are en route to Israel. A large number of them are captured in north Sinai (Egypt) and Eastern Sudan and held in the buildings in north Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asmarino.com/alewana/2038-close-the-torture-houses-in-north-sinai-and-egypt|title=Close the Torture Houses in North Sinai and Egypt|work=[AI] Asmarino Independent|access-date=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704101108/http://asmarino.com/alewana/2038-close-the-torture-houses-in-north-sinai-and-egypt|archive-date=4 July 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sound of torture documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have laws requiring workers to have proper documentation, often intended to prevent or minimize the employment of undocumented immigrants.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} However the penalties against employers are often small and the acceptable identification requirements vague, ill-defined and seldom checked or enforced, making it easy for employers to hire illegal labor.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} Where the [[minimum wage]] is several times the prevailing wage in the home country, employers sometimes pay less than the legal minimum wage or have unsafe working conditions, relying on the reluctance of illegal workers to report the violations to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald|last3=Jacobson|first3=Jeffrey|title=Undocumented Status as a Social Determinant of Occupational Safety and Health: The Workers' Perspective|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|date=2015|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%27_perspective|accessdate=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073634/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%27_perspective|archive-date=5 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

Immigrants from countries that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the [[United States–Mexico border]], the Mona Channel between the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], [[Fuerteventura]], and the [[Strait of Otranto]]. Because these methods are illegal, they are often dangerous. Would-be immigrants have been known to suffocate in [[shipping container]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2000/01/10/migrants000110.html|title=Three undocumented migrants die in shipping container|date=11 November 2000|accessdate=3 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013191646/http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2000/01/10/migrants000110.html|archive-date=13 October 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[boxcar]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Siskind Susser Bland|url=http://www.visalaw.com/98aug/33aug98.html|title=At least 52 immigrants die of heat crossing from Mexico|accessdate=3 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023001/http://www.visalaw.com/98aug/33aug98.html|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trucks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/english/200103/06/eng20010306_64193.html|work=People's Dailt Online|date=6 March 2001|title=Ninth on Trial in Dutch Court for Murder and Illegal Immigration|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119062811/http://english.people.com.cn/english/200103/06/eng20010306_64193.html|archive-date=19 January 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sink in [[shipwreck]]s caused by unseaworthy vessels, die of [[dehydration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=21975|title=Illegal Immigration: An American Tragedy|first=Allan J.|last=Ashinoff|date=12 March 2007|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194753/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=21975|archive-date=29 October 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Hypothermia|exposure]] during long walks without water. An official estimate puts the number of people who died in illegal crossings across the U.S.–Mexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954 (see [[immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border]]).

[[Human smuggling]] is the practice of intermediaries aiding undocumented immigrants in crossing over international borders in financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, [[human trafficking]]. A human smuggler will facilitate [[illegal entry]] into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, [[fraud]], or [[deception]] to obtain and transport people.

Types of notorious human smugglers include [[Snakehead (gang)|Snakehead]] [[gang]]s present in [[mainland China]] (especially in [[Fujian]]) that smuggle laborers into [[Pacific Rim]] states (making [[Chinatown]]s frequent centers of illegal immigration) and "coyotes", who smuggle undocumented immigrants to the [[Southwestern United States]] and have been known to abuse or even kill their passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060723-9999-1m23killed.html|title=Immigrant found slain in Grant Hill house|first=Lola|last=Sherman|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=23 July 2006|accessdate=4 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620221607/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060723-9999-1m23killed.html|archive-date=20 June 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes undocumented immigrants are abandoned by their human traffickers if there are difficulties, often dying in the process. Others may be victims of intentional killing.

===Overstaying a visa===
Many undocumented immigrants are migrants who originally arrive in a country lawfully but overstay their authorized residence (overstaying a [[visa (document)|visa]]).&lt;ref name="iom5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cis.org/Illegal|title=Illegal Immigration|accessdate=4 March 2012|work=Center for Immigration Studies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229021452/http://www.cis.org/illegal|archive-date=29 February 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_10_24/us/immigrants_overstay_visas_us.htm |title=When immigrants overstay visas, US does little |publisher=Workpermit.com |date=24 October 2005 |accessdate=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019005849/http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_10_24/us/immigrants_overstay_visas_us.htm |archive-date=19 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most of the estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants in Canada (perhaps as high as 500,000) are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected but who have not yet been expelled from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Marina Jimenez |url =  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/200000-illegal-immigrants-toiling-in-canadas-underground-economy/article18437108/ |title = 200,000 undocumented immigrants toiling in Canada's underground economy |work = Globe and Mail |date = 15 November 2003 |location = Toronto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is formed by children of foreigners born in countries observing ''[[jus soli]]'' ("right of territory"), such as was the case in France until 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = European University Institute |title = EUDO Citizenship Observatory |url = http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/IusSoli.pdf |date = June 2010 |accessdate = 16 July 2015 |location = Newark, New Jersey |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170308143238/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/IusSoli.pdf |archive-date = 8 March 2017 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ireland until 2005.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent |title=Irish citizenship through birth or descent |publisher=Citizensinformation.ie |date= |accessdate=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529043056/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent |archive-date=29 May 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these countries, it was possible to obtain French or Irish nationality (respectively) solely by being born in France before 1994 or in Ireland before 2005&lt;ref name="citizensinformation.ie"/&gt; (respectively). At present, a French born child of foreign parents does not automatically obtain French nationality until residency duration conditions are met&lt;ref name="iom5" /&gt;. Since 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland does not automatically acquire Irish nationality unless certain conditions are met.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation.ie"/&gt;

===Sham marriages===
Another method is by entering into a [[sham marriage]] where the marriage is contracted into for purely immigration advantage by a couple who are not in a genuine relationship. Common reasons for sham marriages are to gain [[immigration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Ginger owner sentenced for sham-marriage scheme |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011129819_thaiginger20m.html |publisher=Seattle Times |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=11 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006165550/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011129819_thaiginger20m.html |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this is called '''immigration fraud'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owner of Thai Ginger admits to immigration fraud – paying people to 'marry' her relatives|url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/65882672.html|publisher=Bellevue Reporter|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=11 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028085213/http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/65882672.html|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) residency, work or [[citizenship]] rights for one or both of the spouses, or for other benefits.

In the United Kingdom, those who arrange, participate in, or officiate over a sham marriage may be charged with a number of offenses, including assisting unlawful immigration and conspiracy to facilitate breach of immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;Crown Prosecution Service, [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/immigration/#b01 Immigration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215741/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/immigration/#b01 |date=8 April 2014 }}, accessed 4 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has a penalty of a $250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence for such arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aboutusvisas.com/immigration-marriage-fraud/ |title=Just Say No to Immigration Marriage Fraud |publisher=The Law Office of Tanya M.

===Australia===
{{Main article|Immigration in Australia}}
Official government sources put the number of visa overstayers in Australia at approximately 50,000. This has been the official number of illegal immigrants for about 25 years and is considered to be low. Other sources have placed it at up to 100,000, but no detailed study has been completed to quantify this number, which could be significantly higher.

On 1 June 2013, the ''Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Act 2013'' commenced. This new law puts the onus on businesses to ensure that their employees maintain the necessary work entitlements in Australia. The new legislation also enables the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship to levy infringement notices against business (AUD $15,300) and individual (AUD $3,060) employers on a [[strict liability]] basis – meaning that there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vsure.com.au/employer-sanctions-legislation/ |title=Employer Sanctions Legislation |publisher=vSure |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060141/http://www.vsure.com.au/employer-sanctions-legislation/ |archive-date=23 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australias-borders/compliance/legalworkers/factsheet.htm |title=Fact Sheet – Employing Legal Workers |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061217/http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australias-borders/compliance/legalworkers/factsheet.htm |archive-date=23 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhutan===
{{Main article|Illegal immigration in Bhutan}}
[[Immigration in Bhutan]] by Nepalese settlers ([[Lhotshampa]]) began slowly towards the end of the 19th century. The government passed the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985]] to clarify and try to enforce the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958]] to control the flood of illegal immigration. Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be undocumented immigrants. In 1991 and 1992, [[Bhutan]] expelled roughly 139,110 ethnic [[Nepal]]is, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since. The United States has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 [[Bhutanese refugees]] of Nepalese origin now living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The Bhutanese government, even today, has not been able to sort the problem of giving citizenship to those people who are married to Bhutanese, even though they have been in the country for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm |title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' |author = Bhaumik, Subir |date = 7 November 2007 |work = BBC News |accessdate = 19 September 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080819203907/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm |archive-date = 19 August 2008 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{See also|Illegal immigration in Brazil}}
Brazil has long been part of international migration routes. In 2009, the government estimated the number if illegal immigrants at about 200,000 people; a [[Catholic]] charity working with immigrants said there were 600,000 illegal immigrants (75,000 of which from [[Bolivia]]). That same year, the [[Brazilian Parliament]] approved an amnesty, opening a six-month window for all foreigners to seek legalization irrespective of their previous standing before the law. Brazil had last legalized all immigrants in 1998; bilateral deals, one of which promoted the legalization of all reciprocal immigrants with Bolivia to date, signed in 2005, are also common.&lt;ref name="Globo"&gt;{{cite web |author=Da BBC |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL365307-5598,00.html |title=Globo.com |publisher=G1.globo.com |date= |accessdate=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925090704/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL365307-5598,00.html |archive-date=25 September 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the numbers by Roy revealed that on average around 91000 Bangladeshi nationals might have crossed over to India every year during the years 1981–1991 but how many of them were identified and pushed back is not known.

According to a pro-Indian scholar, the trip to India from Bangladesh is one of the cheapest in the world, with a trip costing around Rs.2000 (around $30 US), which includes the fee for the "Tour Operator". As Bangladeshis are cultural similar to the [[Bengali people]] in India, they are able to pass off as Indian citizens and settle down in any part of India to establish a future.,&lt;ref name=ibtimes/&gt; for a very small price. This false identity can be bolstered with false documentation available for as little as Rs.200 ($3 US) can even make them part of the vote bank.&lt;ref name=facingglobal /&gt;


India is constructing barriers on its eastern borders to combat the surge of migrants. The [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]] is 4,000&amp;nbsp;km (2,500&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Presently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4653810.stm|title=Villagers left in limbo by border fence|work=BBC News|access-date=16 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930063811/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4653810.stm|archive-date=30 September 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This obstruction will virtually isolate Bangladesh from India.

===Philippines===
It was estimated by Teresita Ang-See, a prominent leader and activist of the [[Chinese Filipino]] community, that by 2007, as much as 100,000 illegal immigrants from [[China]] are living in the Philippines, a tenth of the ethnic Chinese population. The latest influx has come in part because of Manila's move in 2005 to liberalise entry procedures for Chinese tourists and investors, a move that helped triple the number of Chinese visitors to 133,000 last year. Many of the new Chinese immigrants encounter hostility from many Filipinos, including Filipino-born Chinese, for being perceived as engaging in criminal activities and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landingin |first=Roel |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/194f1172-3a01-11dc-9d73-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Paradox for Philippines as Chinese set up shop |publisher=FT.com |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many immigrant ethnic groups have much higher birth rates than native Russians, further shifting the balance. Some [[Chinese people|Chinese]] flee the overpopulation and birth control regulations of their home country and settle in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]] and in southern [[Siberia]].

Illegal border crossing is considered a crime, and captured illegal border crossers have been sentenced to prison terms. For example, ''[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]'' reported in October 2008 the case of a [[North Korea]]n who was detained after illegally crossing the [[Amur River]] from China. Considered by Russian authorities an "[[economic migrant]]", he was sentenced to 6 months in prison and was to be deported to the country of his nationality after serving his sentence, even though he may now risk an even heavier penalty there. That was just one of the 26 cases year-to-date of illegal entrants, of various nationalities, receiving criminal punishment in [[Amur Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rg.ru/2008/10/29/reg-priamurje/koreets-anons.html|author=Yevgeniy Basenko (Евгений Басенко)|title=A North Korean has swum across the Amur, only to end up in a Russian prison.

The Schengen Area is a multilateral agreement between 26 states in which they in most cases abolish the border control between themselves. These states include most of the EU countries, as well as the EEC countries Norway, Switzerland and Iceland. Any person who is physically inside any of the Schengen states will usually be able to travel to any other Schengen state without hindrance from the law enforcement, even if he or she has no legal right to enter another Schengen Area member state. A person who wishes to immigrate illegally to a Schengen Area member state may therefore find it more practical to enter it through another member state. According to a BBC report from 2012, over 80% of illegal immigrants entering the European Union pass through Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18371800 |work=BBC |title=Journey across crisis-hit Greece:Immigration challenge |date=9 June 2012 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630212258/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18371800 |archive-date=30 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schengen Agreement does not regulate treatment of persons who enter the Schengen Area illegally. This is therefore left to the individual states, and other applicable international treaties and European [[case law]]. Illegal immigration to Schengen and to Europe in general was increasing sharply since approximately early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10865652/Illegal-immigration-to-Europe-shows-sharp-rise.html|title = Illegal immigration to Europe shows sharp rise|publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author = David Barrett|access-date = 5 April 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180531080844/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10865652/Illegal-immigration-to-Europe-shows-sharp-rise.html|archive-date = 31 May 2018|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes for this increase are the conflicts that followed the [[Arab Spring]]; in particular, the civil war in Syria has driven millions of people from their homes, and the disintegration of the Libyan government removed a major barrier for the African migrants.

Illegal immigration to some of the Schengen Area states might face different consideration depending on countries such as Bulgaria, France, Greece.

Approximately 11 million illegal immigrants were estimated to be living in the United States in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0516/p01s02-ussc.html | title = illegal immigrants in the US: How many are there? | work = csmonitor.com | date = 2006-05-16 | last = Knickerbocker | first = Brad | access-date = 25 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120505124757/http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0516/p01s02-ussc.html | archive-date = 5 May 2012 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates from the Pew Hispanic Center show the number of illegal immigrants has declined to 11.1 million in March 2009, from a peak of 12 million in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pewhispanic.org/2010/09/01/us-unauthorized-immigration-flows-are-down-sharply-since-mid-decade |title = U.S. Unauthorized Immigration Flows Are Down Sharply Since Mid-Decade |work = Pew Research Center |date = 2010-09-01 |last = PASSEL |first = JEFFREY S. |last2 = COHN |first2 = D’VERA |access-date = 27 July 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180609061038/http://www.pewhispanic.org/2010/09/01/us-unauthorized-immigration-flows-are-down-sharply-since-mid-decade/ |archive-date = 9 June 2018 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the illegal immigrants are from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4703307 | title = Study Details Lives of Illegal Immigrants in U.S. | work = NPR | date = 2005-06-14 | last = Kahn | first = Carrie | access-date = 5 April 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180612135927/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4703307 | archive-date = 12 June 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of illegal immigration has long been controversial in the United States. In 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] called for Congress to endorse his guest worker proposal, stating that illegal immigrants took jobs that Americans would not take.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2006-04-10-immigrants-economic-impact_x.htm |title= Immigrants Claim Pivotal Role in Economy | work = USA Today |date=2006-04-11 |last = Lynch |first = David J. |last2 =   Woodyard |first2 =Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pew Hispanic Center]] notes that while the number of legal immigrants arriving has not varied substantially since the 1980s, the number of illegal immigrants has increased dramatically and, since the mid-1990s, has surpassed the number of [[Immigration to the United States|legal immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/46.pdf |title= Illegal Migrants: Numbers and Characteristics |accessdate= 1 March 2009 |date= 14 May 2005 |work=  |publisher= Pew Hispanic Center |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090301015524/http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/46.pdf |archive-date= 1 March 2009 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties for employers of illegal immigrants, of $2,000–$10,000 and up to six months' imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc/ref/8usc1324a.htm |title= Title 8—Aliens and Nationality, Chapter 12—Immigration and Nationality, Subchapter II—Immigration (Sec. 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and 8 U.S.C. 1324a) |accessdate= 1 March 2009 |date=  |work= U.S. Code Online |publisher= United States Department of Justice |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081230034455/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc/ref/8USC1324a.htm |archivedate= 30 December 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; go largely unenforced.

Political groups like [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Americans for Legal Immigration|Americans for Legal Immigration]] have formed to demand enforcement of immigration laws and secure borders. ALIPAC has also called for "safe departure" border checkpoints, free of criminal checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/27/anti-immigrant-group-calls-safe-passage-illegals|title=Anti-Illegal Immigration Group Calls for 'Safe Passage' of Illegals Out of U.S.|work=Fox News|access-date=28 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729040548/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/27/anti-immigrant-group-calls-safe-passage-illegals/|archive-date=29 July 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 news story, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported, &lt;blockquote&gt;... illegal immigrants in 2010 were parents of 5.5 million children, 4.5 million of whom were [[Anchor baby|born in the U.S.]] and are citizens. Because illegal immigrants are younger and more likely to be married, they represented a disproportionate share of births—8% of the babies born in the U.S. between March 2009 and March 2010 were to at least one illegal immigrant parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/02/nation/la-na-pew-immigration-20110202 |title= Illegal immigration in U.S. stabilizes |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 2011-02-02 |last= Riccardi |first= Nicholas |access-date= 16 July 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121011130249/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/02/nation/la-na-pew-immigration-20110202 |archive-date= 11 October 2012 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Immigration from Mexico to the United States has slowed in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goerdt|first=Ana|title=Ignoring the numbers on Mexico-U.S. migration|url=http://borderfactcheck.tumblr.com/post/25371709357/ignoring-numbers-us-mexico-migration|work=Border Fact Check|publisher=Washington Office on Latin America|accessdate=23 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929100332/http://borderfactcheck.tumblr.com/post/25371709357/ignoring-numbers-us-mexico-migration|archive-date=29 September 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to the slowing of the U.S. economy, the buildup in security along the border and increased violence on the Mexican side of the [[Mexico-United States border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isacson|first1=Adam|last2=Meyer|first2=Maureen|title=Beyond the Border Buildup: Security and Migrants along the U.S.-Mexico Border|year=2012|publisher=Washington Office on Latin America|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-9834517-8-5|page=57|url=http://www.wola.org/files/Beyond_the_Border_Buildup_FINAL.pdf|access-date=23 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227193202/http://www.wola.org/files/Beyond_the_Border_Buildup_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Library of Congress]], announced it would use "noncitizens" and "unauthorized immigration" rather than "illegal aliens" as a bibliographical term. It said the once common phrase had become offensive, and was not precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-library-congress-alien-20160403-story.html |title= Library of Congress to stop using term 'illegal alien' |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 2016-04-03 |last= Padilla |first= Steve |last2= Rivera |first2= Selene |access-date= 27 July 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180727181436/http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-library-congress-alien-20160403-story.html |archive-date= 27 July 2018 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] instructed the US attorneys offices not to use the term "undocumented immigrants", but to instead refer to people as "illegal aliens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/justice-department-illegal-aliens-undocumented|title=Justice Department: Use 'illegal aliens,' not 'undocumented'|work=CNN|date=2018-06-24|last=Kopan|first=Tal|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727181035/https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/justice-department-illegal-aliens-undocumented|archive-date=27 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
An estimated 200,000 Colombians have fled the [[Colombian civil war (1964–present)|Colombian civil war]] and sought safety in Venezuela. Most of them lack identity documents and this hampers their access to services, as well as to the labor market. The Venezuelan government has no specific policies on refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LSGZ-7AYHES?OpenDocument|title=Colombia: UNHCR signs agreement with Venezuelan "Banco del Pueblo Soberano"|work=ReliefWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/content/venezuela Venezuela | Child Soldiers Global Report 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826063839/http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/content/venezuela |date=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, he has been serving as the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[Chairman]] of [[Infinitum AS]], the operator of the national paid recycling scheme for bottles and cans marked with the official "recyclable" or "[[Container deposit legislation|deposit]]" logo in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arguing about bottle deposit money (English-translated title)|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/krangler-om-pantepenger/241926|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better sorting, better price (English-translated title)|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/industri-jo-bedre-sortering-jo-bedre-pris/248784|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Being a graduated from [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]] in [[Trondheim]], Maldum has served in different technical and leadership positions before being appointed as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Infinitum in 2007.

==Advocating for environment==
Through his career and especially in deposit-return system for bottles, he became a known figure for advocating for environment in Norway, lecturing at academic gatherings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logistics Seminar in Bergen, February 2007|url=http://www.logistikkforeningen.no/file.php?id=271|website=Logistikkforeningen.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national TV programs to promote the idea of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Søk - Kjell Olav Maldum|url=https://tv.nrk.no/sok?q=Kjell%20Olav%20Maldum&amp;filter=rettigheter|website=NRK TV|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has promoted sustainable production with low impact on environment and recycling of one-way containers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vil heve panten på boks og flasker|url=https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/vil-heve-panten-pa-boks-og-flasker-1.7307823|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV 16.09.2011 (program nr 1435)|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/16.09.2011-_program-nr-1435_-1.7794618|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangler 40 millioner bokser|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/mangler-40-millioner-bokser-1.5507016|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avoid wasting food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right in the garbage with fruit and vegetables (English-translated title)|url=http://www.vg.no/forbruker/mat-og-drikke/mat/rett-i-soepla-med-frukt-og-groent/a/105074/|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;In 2006 he won the Optimization Award of the year in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optimization Award 2006: the winner is Kjell Olav Maldum - Ny Teknikk|url=http://www.nyteknikk.no/index.php?articleid=2570|website=www.nyteknikk.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the first time that a person won the award instead of an entity for "his extensive efforts to ensure that the retail sector have optimal logistics and thus be the most environmentally friendly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emballasjedagene 07: Kjell Olav Maldum fikk Optimeringsprisen {{!}} PACKobserver|url=http://www.packobserver.dk/idn651.asp|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Maldum has been behind the deposit-return TV commercials and "Infinitum movement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum Movement|url=http://infinitummovement.no/|website=Infinitum Movement|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Norway where a number of celebrities, artists and athletes advertise and encourage for recycling of the materials in the society. The movememnt encourages people to infinitely recycle instead the containers instead of just rhewoing them away. Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] also took part&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Se Dagsrevyen 21|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/dagsrevyen-21/NNFA21101614/16-10-2014|website=National Norwegian TV - NRK|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statsministeren gir sin pant til TV-aksjonen|url=http://infinitum.no/aktuelt/statsministeren-gir-sin-pant-til-tv-aksjonen|website=infinitum.no|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the TV action for the bottle recycling.

==Special initiatives==
*Coca-Cola switching to deposit bottles
Until 2014 [[Coca-Cola]] has been using non-deposit bottle for its beverages in Norway. Kjell Olav Maldum played a central role in negotiations for Coca-Cola Norway switching from non-deposit refillable bottles to non-refillable deposit bottles. The move was considered as an environmentally friendly one to introduce deposit on bottles and decrease littering, but it also led to downsizing of Coca-Cola in Norway due to less labor needed for one-way bottles and made headline in Norwegian market about the job losses and also counter-arguments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cola-kutt kan gi nye arbeidsplasser|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/cola-kutt-kan-gi-nye-arbeidsplasser-1.7991853|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola Norway also promised to invest in recycling facilities inside Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Packaging: Recycling|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/packaging-recycling|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Recycling cans in Norway
Maldum was also behind the efforts that finally led to the recycling of aluminum cans performed in Norway. The aluminum cans that have been collected in Norway were used to be sent to France for recycling but it has been recycled by Norsk Hydro in Holmestrand since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solholm|first1=Rolleiv|title=More environmentally friendly recycling|url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/culture/museums/29252|website=www.norwaypost.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was considered as environmentally friendly step vowing for recycling 60,000 mt of aluminium annually in Holmestrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now recycled in Norway: drink cans get a shorter trip to their new life  - Norsk Hydro|url=http://www.hydro.com/en/Press-room/News/Archive/2013/Now-recycled-in-Norway-drink-cans-get-a-shorter-trip-to-their-new-life-/|website=www.hydro.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''l''-diversity''' is a form of group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation. This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The ''l''-diversity model is an extension of the [[k-anonymity|''k''-anonymity]] model which reduces the granularity of data representation using techniques including generalization and suppression such that any given record maps onto at least ''k-1'' other records in the data.   The ''l''-diversity model handles some of the weaknesses in the ''k''-anonymity model where protected identities to the level of ''k''-individuals is not equivalent to protecting the corresponding sensitive values that were generalized or suppressed, especially when the sensitive values within a group exhibit homogeneity. The ''l''-diversity model adds the promotion of intra-group diversity for sensitive values in the anonymization mechanism.

==Attacks on ''k''-anonymity==

While ''k''-anonymity is a promising approach to take for group based anonymization given its simplicity and wide array of algorithms that perform it, it is however susceptible to many attacks. When background knowledge is available to an attacker, such attacks become even more effective. Such attacks include:

* '''Homogeneity Attack''': This attack leverages the case where all the values for a sensitive value within a set of ''k'' records are identical. In such cases, even though the data has been ''k''-anonymized, the sensitive value for the set of ''k'' records may be exactly predicted.
* '''Background Knowledge Attack''': This attack leverages an association between one or more quasi-identifier attributes with the sensitive attribute to reduce the set of possible values for the sensitive attribute. For example, Machanavajjhala, Kifer, Gehrke, and Venkitasubramaniam (2007) showed that knowing that heart attacks occur at a reduced rate in Japanese patients could be used to narrow the range of values for a sensitive attribute of a patient's disease.

==Formal definition==

Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred for ''k''-anonymity data, the ''l''-diversity method was created to further ''k''-anonymity by additionally maintaining the diversity of sensitive fields.  The book ''Privacy-Preserving Data Mining – Models and Algorithms'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy-Preserving Data Mining – Models and Algorithms|last = Aggarwal|first = Charu C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-387-70991-8|location = |pages = 11-52 |url = http://charuaggarwal.net/generalsurvey.pdf|chapter = A General Survey of Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Models and Algorithms|last2 = Yu|first2 = Philip S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''l''-diversity as being:

{{quote|Let a q*-block be a set of tuples such that its non-sensitive values generalize to q*. A q*-block is ''l''-diverse if it contains ''l'' "well represented" values for the sensitive attribute S. A table is ''l''-diverse, if every q*-block in it is ''l''-diverse.}}

The paper ''t''-Closeness: Privacy beyond ''k''-anonymity and ''l''-diversity (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4221659|journal = IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering, 2007.

Machanavajjhala et. al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = L-diversity: Privacy Beyond K-anonymity|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1217299.1217302|journal = ACM Trans. Knowl. Discov.

Based on this information, Alice learns that Umeko’s information is contained in record number 1,2,3, or 4. Without additional information, Alice is not sure whether Umeko caught a virus or has heart disease. However, it is well known that Japanese have an extremely low incidence of heart disease. Therefore Alice concludes with near certainty that Umeko has a viral infection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; define “well-represented” in three possible ways:
# '''Distinct ''l''-diversity''' – The simplest definition ensures that at least ''l'' distinct values for the sensitive field in each equivalence class.
# '''Entropy ''l''-diversity''' – The most complex definition defines ''Entropy'' of an equivalent class ''E'' to be the negation of summation of ''s'' across the domain of the sensitive attribute of ''p''(''E'',''s'')log(''p''(''E'',''s'')) where ''p''(''E'',''s'') is the fraction of records in ''E'' that have the sensitive value ''s''. A table has entropy ''l''-diversity when for every equivalent class ''E'', ''Entropy''(''E'') ≥ log(''l'').
# '''Recursive (''c''-''l'')-diversity''' – A compromise definition that ensures the most common value does not appear too often while less common values are ensured to not appear too infrequently.

Aggarwal and Yu (2008) note that when there is more than one sensitive field the ''l''-diversity problem becomes more difficult due to added dimensionalities.

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

}}
Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

}}

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Language politics}}
[[File:French and Flemish Sign in Brussels.jpg|thumb|The politics of language are evident in French-speaking Brussels, which is located in the Flanders region of Belgium, where people typically speak Flemish.  Divisive preference of either language is avoided by using both French and Flemish on nearly all signs in Brussels.]]
'''Language politics''' is the way language and linguistic differences between peoples are dealt with in the political arena.  This could manifest as government recognition, as well as how language is treated in official capacities.  Some examples:

*Legal status of a language as an [[official language]] in a [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]]. This generally means that all official documents affecting a country or region are published in the official language(s), but not in those that are not. Evidence in a court of law may also be expected to be presented in an official language.&lt;ref name=Patten2011&gt;{{cite journal |title= Political Theory and Language Policy |author= Alan Patten |journal= Political Theory |volume=29 |number=5 |date=October 2011 |pages=691–715 |publisher=Princeton|url= http://www.princeton.edu/~apatten/languagepolicy_politicaltheory.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2018 |format=pdf|doi=10.1177/0090591701029005005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In countries where there are more than one main language, there are often political implications in decisions that are seen to promote one group of speakers over another, and this is often referred to as language politics. An example of a country with this type of language politics is [[Belgium]].
*In countries where there is one main language, immigrants seeking full [[citizenship]] may be expected to have a degree of fluency in that language ('language politics' then being a reference to the debate over the appropriateness of this). This has been a feature of [[Australian politics]].
*At various times [[minority language]]s have either been promoted or banned in schools, as politicians have either sought to promote a minority language with a view to strengthening the cultural identity of its speakers, or banning its use (either for teaching, or on occasion an entire ban on its use), with a view to promoting a national identity based on the majority language. An example of recent promotion of a minority language are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Leonese language|Leonese]] by the Leonese City Council, an example of official discouragement of a minority language is [[Breton language|Breton]].
*Language politics also sometimes relates to [[dialect]], where speakers of a particular dialect are perceived as speaking a more culturally 'advanced' or 'correct' form of the language. Politicians may therefore try to use that dialect rather than their own when in the public eye. Alternatively, at times those speaking the dialect perceived as more 'correct' may try to use another dialect when in the public eye to be seen as a 'man/woman of the people'.
*To promote national identity, what are strictly dialects of the same language may be promoted as separate languages to promote a sense of national identity (examples include [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]&amp;nbsp;– the latter two also use different scripts for what is linguistically the same language&amp;nbsp;– [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] for Serbian and [[Latin alphabet|roman script]] for Croatian). Whether or not something is a language can also involve language politics, for instance, [[Political views on the Macedonian language|Macedonian]].
*The use of 'he' and other words implying the masculine in documents has been a political issue relating to [[women's rights]].
*The use of words which are considered by some to have negative implications to describe a group of people e.g. Gypsies (or even more negatively, 'Gypos') instead of [[Romani people|Romani]], or indeed using the term 'Gypsies' to cover [[Irish Traveller|Traveller]] peoples as well as Romanies.
*'[[Political correctness]]' issues often stem from the use of words. For instance, some may object to the person in charge of an organisation being referred to as 'chairman', on the grounds that it implies a man must be in charge.
*Co-existence of competing spelling systems for the same language, associated with different political camps. E.g.
** [[Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]]
** [[Reforms of Russian orthography|Simplification of Russian orthography]]; proposals for such a reform were viewed as subversive in the late years of the Russian Empire and were implemented by the  [[Bolshevik]]s in 1918, after which the "old orthography" became associated with the [[White movement]].
** The two spelling systems for the [[Belarusian language]], one of which is associated with the country's political opposition.
Language is also utilised in political matters to unify, organise and criticise in order to unify a political group.
* The [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]] preserved in [[Transnistria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16907">In [[statistics]], the '''likelihood principle''' is that, given a [[statistical model]], all the evidence in a [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] relevant to model parameters is contained in the [[likelihood function]].

A likelihood function arises from a [[probability density function]] considered as a function of its distributional parameterization argument. For example, consider a model which gives the probability density function ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''θ'') of observable [[random variable]] ''X'' as a function of a parameter&amp;nbsp;''θ''. Then for a specific value ''x'' of ''X'', the function &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt;(''θ''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''x'') =&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''θ'') is a likelihood function of&amp;nbsp;''θ'': it gives a measure of how "likely" any particular value of ''θ'' is, if we know that ''X'' has the value&amp;nbsp;''x''. The density function may be a density with respect to counting measure, i.e. a [[probability mass function]].

Two likelihood functions are ''equivalent'' if one is a scalar multiple of the other. The '''likelihood principle''' is this: all information from the data that is relevant to inferences about the value of the model parameters is in the equivalence class to which the likelihood function belongs. The '''strong likelihood principle''' applies this same criterion to cases such as sequential experiments where the sample of data that is available results from applying a [[stopping rule]] to the observations earlier in the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms. OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

Suppose

*''X'' is the number of successes in twelve [[statistical independence|independent]] [[Bernoulli trial]]s with probability ''θ'' of success on each trial, and
*''Y'' is the number of independent Bernoulli trials needed to get three successes, again with probability ''θ'' (= 1/2 for a coin-toss) of success on each trial.

Then the observation that ''X'' = 3 induces the likelihood function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(\theta  \mid X=3) = \binom{12} 3 \theta^3(1-\theta)^9 = 220\theta^3(1-\theta)^9, &lt;/math&gt;

while the observation that ''Y'' = 12 induces the likelihood function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(\theta \mid Y=12) = \binom{11} 2 \theta^3(1-\theta)^9 = 55\theta^3(1-\theta)^9.&lt;/math&gt;

The likelihood principle says that, as the data are the same in both cases, the inferences drawn about the value of θ should also be the same. In addition, all the inferential content in the data about the value of θ is contained in the two likelihoods, and is the same if they are proportional to one another. This is the case in the above example, reflecting the fact that the difference between observing ''X'' = 3 and observing ''Y'' = 12 lies not in the actual data, but merely in the [[design of experiments|design of the experiment]]. Specifically, in one case, one has decided in advance to try twelve times; in the other, to keep trying until three successes are observed.  The inference about θ should be the same, and this is reflected in the fact that the two likelihoods are proportional to each other.

This is not always the case, however. The use of [[frequentist]] methods involving [[p-values]] leads to different inferences for the two cases above,&lt;ref name="Vidakovic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidakovic|first1=Brani|title=The Likelihood Principle|url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~brani/isyebayes/bank/handout2.pdf|website=H.

==The law of likelihood==

A related concept is the '''law of likelihood''', the notion that the extent to which the evidence supports one parameter value or hypothesis against another is equal to the ratio of their likelihoods.
That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = {\mathcal L(a\mid X=x) \over \mathcal L(b\mid X=x)} = {P(X=x\mid a) \over P(X=x\mid b)}&lt;/math&gt;
is the degree to which the observation x supports parameter value or hypothesis ''a'' against ''b''. If this ratio is 1, the evidence is indifferent; if greater than 1, the evidence supports the value ''a'' against ''b''; or if less, then vice versa.  The use of [[Bayes factor]]s can extend this by taking account of the complexity of different hypotheses.

Combining the likelihood principle with the law of likelihood yields the consequence that the parameter value which maximizes the likelihood function is the value which is most strongly supported by the evidence. This is the basis for the widely used [[maximum likelihood|method of maximum likelihood]].

== History ==

The likelihood principle was first identified by that name in print in 1962
(Barnard et al., Birnbaum, and Savage et al.),
but arguments for the same principle, unnamed, and the use of the principle in applications goes back to the works of [[Ronald A. Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] in the 1920s. 
The law of likelihood was identified by that name by [[Ian Hacking|I. Hacking]] (1965).
More recently the likelihood principle as a general principle of inference has been championed by [[A. W. F. Edwards]]. The likelihood principle has been applied to the [[philosophy of science]] by R. Royall.&lt;ref&gt;Royall, Richard (1997) Statistical Evidence: A likelihood paradigm. Chapman and Hall, Boca Raton. {{ISBN|0-412-04411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Birnbaum|Birnbaum]] proved that the likelihood principle follows from two more primitive and seemingly reasonable principles, the ''[[conditionality principle]]'' and the ''[[sufficiency principle]]''. The conditionality principle says that if an experiment is chosen by a random process independent of the states of nature &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then only the experiment actually performed is relevant to inferences about &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The sufficiency principle says that if &lt;math&gt;T(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sufficient statistic]] for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and if in two experiments with data &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; we have  &lt;math&gt;T(x_1)=T(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then the evidence about &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; given by the two experiments is the same.

== Arguments for and against ==
Some widely used methods of conventional statistics, for example many [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s, are not consistent with the likelihood principle.

Let us briefly consider some of the arguments for and against the likelihood principle.

===The original Birnbaum argument===

Birnbaum's proof of the likelihood principle has been disputed by philosophers of science, including [[Deborah Mayo]]&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, D. (2010) [http://www.phil.vt.edu/dmayo/personal_website/ch%207%20mayo%20birnbaum%20proof.pdf "An Error in the Argument from Conditionality and Sufficiency to the Likelihood Principle"] in ''Error and Inference: Recent Exchanges on Experimental Reasoning, Reliability and the Objectivity and Rationality of Science'' (D Mayo and A. Spanos eds.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 305-314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Deborah (2014), "[https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1408368565 On the Birnbaum Argument for the Strong Likelihood Principle]", ''[[Statistical Science]]'', 29: 227-266 (with Discussion).&lt;/ref&gt; and statisticians including Michael Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Michael (2013) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5468 What does the proof of Birnbaum's theorem prove?]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a new proof of the likelihood principle has been provided by Greg Gandenberger.&lt;ref&gt;Gandenberger, Greg (2014), "A new proof of the likelihood principle", ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'', 66: 475-503; {{doi|10.1093/bjps/axt039}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental design arguments on the likelihood principle===
Unrealized events play a role in some common statistical methods. For example, the result of a [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]] depends on the [[p-value|''p''-value]], the probability of a result as extreme or more extreme than the observation, and that probability may depend on the design of the experiment. To the extent that the likelihood principle is accepted, such methods are therefore denied.

Some classical significance tests are not based on the likelihood.  A commonly cited example is the [[optional stopping]] problem. Suppose I tell you that I tossed a coin 12 times and in the process observed 3 heads. You might make some inference about the probability of heads and whether the coin was fair. Suppose now I tell that I tossed the coin ''until'' I observed 3 heads, and I tossed it 12 times. Will you now make some different inference?

The likelihood function is the same in both cases: it is proportional to
:&lt;math&gt;p^3 (1-p)^9.&lt;/math&gt;

According to the likelihood principle, the inference should be the same in either case.

Suppose a number of scientists are assessing the probability of a certain outcome (which we shall call 'success') in experimental trials. Conventional wisdom suggests that if there is no bias towards success or failure then the success probability would be one half.  Adam, a scientist, conducted 12 trials and obtains 3 successes and 9 failures.  Then he left the lab.

Bill, a colleague in the same lab, continued Adam's  work and published Adam's results, along with a significance test. He tested the [[null hypothesis]] that ''p'', the success probability, is equal to a half, versus ''p'' &lt; 0.5. The probability of the observed result that out of 12 trials 3 or something fewer (i.e. more extreme) were successes, if ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is true, is

:&lt;math&gt;\left({12 \choose 9}+{12 \choose 10}+{12 \choose 11}+{12 \choose 12}\right)\left({1 \over 2}\right)^{12}&lt;/math&gt;

which is 299/4096 = 7.3%. Thus the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 5% significance level.

Charlotte, another scientist, reads Bill's paper and writes a letter, saying that it is possible that Adam kept trying until he obtained 3 successes, in which case the probability of needing to conduct 12 or more experiments is given by

: &lt;math&gt;1-\left({10 \choose 2}\left({1 \over 2}\right)^{11}+{9 \choose 2}\left({1 \over 2} \right)^{10}+\cdots +{2 \choose 2}\left({1 \over 2}\right)^3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is 134/4096 = 3.27%. Now the result ''is'' statistically significant at the 5% level. Note that there is no contradiction among these two results; both computations are correct.

To these scientists, whether a result is significant or not depends on the design of the experiment, not on the likelihood (in the sense of the likelihood function) of the parameter value being&amp;nbsp;1/2.

Results of this kind are considered by some as arguments against the likelihood principle. For others it exemplifies the value of the likelihood principle and is an argument against significance tests.

Similar themes appear when comparing [[Fisher's exact test]] with [[Pearson's chi-squared test]].

===The voltmeter story===

An argument in favor of the likelihood principle is given by Edwards in his book ''Likelihood''. He cites the following story from J.W. Pratt, slightly condensed here. Note that the likelihood function depends only on what actually happened, and not on what ''could'' have happened.

: An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltage. The measurements range from 75 to 99 volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100, so the population appears to be 'censored'. This necessitates a new analysis, if the statistician is orthodox. However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000 volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But, the next day the engineer informs the statistician that this second meter was not working at the time of the measuring. The statistician ascertains that the engineer would not have held up the measurements until the meter was fixed, and informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. "Next you'll be asking about my oscilloscope".

This story can be translated to Adam's stopping rule above, as follows. Adam stopped immediately after 3 successes, because his boss Bill had instructed him to do so. Adam did not die. After the publication of the statistical analysis by Bill, Adam discovers that he has missed a second instruction from Bill to conduct 12 trials instead, and that Bill's paper is based on this second instruction. Adam is very glad that he got his 3 successes after exactly 12 trials, and explains to his friend Charlotte that by coincidence he executed the second instruction. Later, he is astonished to hear about Charlotte's letter explaining that now the result is significant.

In [[ethology]] and [[social science]], '''male bonding''' is the formation of close personal relationships, and patterns of [[friendship]] or cooperation between males.

In the context of human relationships, male bonding is used to describe friendship between men, or the way in which men befriend each other. The expression is sometimes used synonymously with the word [[camaraderie]]. The first widely noticed use of the term was in ''Men in Groups'' (1969; 2004) by anthropologist [[Lionel Tiger]].

Male bonding can take place in various locations such as gyms, locker rooms, sport fields or courts, fraternities, and barbershops. This can include playing musical instruments, video games, business ventures, creative endeavors, journeys, quests, sporting activities, fishing, hunting, camping, gambling, social drinking, smoking cigars, working with tools, or even just conversing.

In [[behavioral geography]], a '''mental map''' is a person's [[Perspective (cognitive)|point-of-view]] perception of their area of interaction. Although this kind of subject matter would seem most likely to be studied by fields in the [[social sciences]], this particular subject is most often studied by modern day [[geographers]]. They study it to determine [[Subjectivity|subjective]] qualities from the public such as personal preference and practical uses of geography like driving directions. [[Mass media]] also have a virtually direct effect on a person's mental map of the geographical world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalmaps.info Mental Maps Resource Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived geographical dimensions of a foreign nation (relative to one's own nation) may often be heavily influenced by the amount of time and relative news coverage that the news media may spend covering news events from that foreign region. For instance, a person might perceive a small island to be nearly the size of a continent, merely based on the amount of news coverage that he or she is exposed to on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/cs/culturalgeography/a/mentalmaps.htm Mental Maps on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Experimental psychology|psychology]], the term names the information maintained in the mind of an organism by means of which it may plan activities, select routes over previously traveled territories, etc. The rapid traversal of a familiar [[maze]] depends on this kind of mental map if scents or other markers laid down by the subject are eliminated before the maze is re-run.

==Background==
Mental maps are an outcome of the field of behavioral geography. The imagined maps are considered one of the first studies that intersected geographical settings with human action.&lt;ref name="Gregory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=Derek|title=Dictionary of Human Geography: Mental maps/Cognitive Maps|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken|edition=5th |author2=Johnston, Rom |author3=Pratt, Geraldine |page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most prominent contribution and study of mental maps was in the writings of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]]. In ''[[The Image of the City]]'', Lynch used simple sketches of maps created from memory of an urban area to reveal five elements of the city; nodes, edges, districts, paths and landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|title=The Image of the City|year=1960|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lynch claimed that “Most often our perception of the city is not sustained, but rather partial, fragmentary, mixed with other concerns. Nearly every sense is in operation, and the image is the composite of them all.” (Lynch, 1960, p 2.) The creation of a mental map relies on memory as opposed to being copied from a preexisting map or image. In ''The Image of the City'', Lynch asks a participant to create a map as follows: “Make it just as if you were making a rapid description of the city to a stranger, covering all the main features. We don’t expect an accurate drawing- just a rough sketch.” (Lynch 1960, p 141) In the field of human geography mental maps have led to an emphasizing of social factors and the use of social methods versus quantitative or positivist methods.&lt;ref name="Gregory" /&gt; Mental maps have often led to revelations regarding social conditions of a particular space or area. Haken and Portugali (2003) developed an information view, which 
argued that the face of the city is its information &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haken|first=Herman|author2=Portugali, Juval|title=The face of the city is its information|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=August 2003|volume=23|pages=385–408|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(03)00003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Bin Jiang (2012) argued that the image of the city (or mental map) arises out of the scaling of city artifacts and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|title=The image of the city out of the underlying scaling of city artifacts or locations|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=2012|volume=103|pages= 1552–1566| doi = 10.1080/00045608.2013.779503 |arxiv=1209.1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed that why the image of city can be formed 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|title=Why can the image of the city be formed| arxiv=1212.3703|bibcode=2012arXiv1212.3703J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, and he even suggested ways of computing the image of the city, or more precisely the kind of collective image of the city, using increasingly available geographic information such as Flickr and Twitter
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|title=Computing the image of the city| arxiv=1212.0940|bibcode=2012arXiv1212.0940J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Research applications==
Mental maps have been used in a collection of spatial research. Many studies have been performed that focus on the quality of an environment in terms of feelings such as fear, desire and stress. A study by Matei et al. in 2001 used mental maps to reveal the role of media in shaping urban space in Los Angeles. The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to process 215 mental maps taken from seven neighborhoods across the city. The results showed that people’s fear perceptions in Los Angeles are not associated with high crime rates but are instead associated with a concentration of certain ethnicities in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matei|first=Sorin |author2=Ball-Rokeach, Sandra |author3=Qiu Linchuan, Jack|title=Fear and Misperception of Los Angeles Urban Space: A Spatial-Statistical Study of Communication-Shaped Mental Maps|journal=Communication Research|date=August 2001|volume=28|issue=4|pages=429–463|accessdate=4 November 2012|url=http://mentalmap.org/files/matei_fear_CR.pdf|doi=10.1177/009365001028004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mental maps recorded in the study draw attention to these areas of concentrated ethnicities as parts of the urban space to avoid or stay away from. 
	
Mental maps have also been used to describe the urban experience of children. In a 2008 study by Olga den Besten mental maps were used to map out the fears and dislikes of children in Berlin and Paris. The study looked into the absence of children in today’s cities and the urban environment from a child’s perspective of safety, stress and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Den Besten|first=Olga den|title=Local belonging and ‘geographies of emotions’: Immigrant children’s experience of their neighbourhoods in Paris and Berlin|journal=Childhood|date=May 2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=181–195|url=http://chd.sagepub.com/content/17/2/181|accessdate=4 November 2012|doi=10.1177/0907568210365649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Gould and Rodney White have performed prominent analyses in the book “Mental Maps.” This book is an investigation into people’s spatial desires. The book asks of its participants: “Suppose you were suddenly given the chance to choose where you would like to live- an entirely free choice that you could make quite independently of the usual constraints of income or job availability. Where would you choose to go?” (Gould, 1974, p 15) Gould and White use their findings to create a surface of desire for various areas of the world. The surface of desire is meant to show people’s environmental preferences and regional biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Peter|title=Mental Maps|year=1993|publisher=Rutledge|location=New York|author2=White, Rodney|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment done by [[Edward C. Tolman]], the development of a mental map was seen in rats.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B. (2011). ''Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.).'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; A rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it. After this initial exploration, the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right. The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial mental map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed.

The idea of mental maps is also used in strategic analysis. David Brewster, an Australian strategic analyst, has applied the concept to strategic conceptions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.

'''Military meteorology''' is [[meteorology]] applied to [[military]] purposes, by [[armed forces]] or other agencies. It is one of the most common fields of employment for meteorologists. 

[[World War II]] brought great advances in meteorology as large-scale military land, sea, and air campaigns were highly dependent on weather, particularly forecasts provided by the [[Royal Navy]], [[Met Office]] and [[USAAF]] for the [[Normandy landing#Weather|Normandy landing]] and [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]].  

University meteorology departments grew rapidly as the military services sent cadets to be trained as weather officers. Wartime technological developments such as radar also proved to be valuable meteorological observing systems. More recently, the use of [[satellite]]s in space has contributed extensively to military meteorology.

Military meteorologists currently operate with a wide variety of military units, from aircraft carriers to special forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8127">A '''multi-compartment model''' is a type of [[mathematical model]] used for describing the way materials or energies are transmitted among the ''compartments'' of a system. Each compartment is assumed to be a homogeneous entity within which the entities being modelled are equivalent. For instance, in a pharmacokinetic model, the compartments may represent different sections of a body within which the concentration of a drug is assumed to be uniformly equal.

Hence a multi-compartment model is a [[lumped parameters]] model.

Multi-compartment models are used in many fields including [[pharmacokinetics]], [[compartmental models in epidemiology|epidemiology]], [[biomedicine]], [[systems theory]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]], engineering, physics, information science and social science. The circuits systems can be viewed as a multi-compartment model as well.

In systems theory, it involves the description of a network whose components are compartments that represent a population of elements that are equivalent with respect to the manner in which they process input signals to the compartment.

:
*Instant homogeneous distribution of materials or energies within a "compartment."
*The exchange rate of materials or energies among the compartments is related to the densities of these compartments.
*Usually, it is desirable that the materials do not undergo chemical reactions while transmitting among the compartments.
*When concentration of the cell is of interest, typically the volume is assumed to be constant over time, though this may not be totally true in reality. 
     
Most commonly, the mathematics of multi-compartment models is simplified to provide only a single parameter—such as concentration—within a compartment.

== Single-compartment model ==
[[Image:Singlecell.PNG]]

Possibly the simplest application of multi-compartment model is in the single-cell concentration monitoring (see the figure above). If the volume of a cell is ''V'', the [[mass]] of [[solution|solute]] is ''q'', the input is ''u''(''t'') and the secretion of the solution is proportional to the density of it within the cell, then the concentration of the solution ''C'' within the cell over time is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=u(t)-kq&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the proportionality.

==Multi-Compartment Model==
As the number of compartments increases, the model can be very complex and the solutions usually beyond ordinary calculation.

The formulae for '''n-cell''' multi-compartment models become:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot{q}_1=q_1 k_{11}+q_2 k_{12}+\cdots+q_n k_{1n}+u_1(t) \\
\dot{q}_2=q_1 k_{21}+q_2 k_{22}+\cdots+q_n k_{2n}+u_2(t) \\
\vdots\\
\dot{q}_n=q_1 k_{n1}+q_2 k_{n2}+\cdots+q_n k_{nn}+u_n(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
:&lt;math&gt;0=\sum^n_{i=1}{k_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; (as the total 'contents' of all compartments is constant in a closed system)

Or in matrix forms:
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\dot{q}}=\mathbf{Kq}+\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11}&amp; k_{12} &amp;\cdots &amp;k_{1n}\\
k_{21}&amp; k_{22} &amp; \cdots&amp;k_{2n}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots \\
k_{n1}&amp; k_{n2} &amp;\cdots &amp;k_{nn}\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\mathbf{q}=\begin{bmatrix}
q_1 \\
q_2 \\
\vdots \\
q_n
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}
u_1(t) \\
u_2(t) \\
\vdots \\
u_n(t)
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp;\cdots &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; (as the total 'contents' of all compartments is constant in a closed system)

In the special case of a closed system (see below) i.e. where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=0&lt;/math&gt; then there is a general solution.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v_2} + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t} \mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt; are the respective [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, .... and &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

However it can be shown that given the above requirement to ensure the 'contents' of a closed system are constant, then for every pair of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] and [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] then either &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v}=0&lt;/math&gt; and also that one [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] is 0, say &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;

So
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = c_1  \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v_2} + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t} \mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v_i}=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}=2, 3, \dots n&lt;/math&gt;

This solution can be rearranged:

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{q} = 
\Bigg[ \mathbf{v_1}\begin{bmatrix}
 c_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
+ \mathbf{v_2}\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; c_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
+ \dots + \mathbf{v_n}\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; c_n \\
 \end{bmatrix} \Bigg]
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
e^{\lambda_2t} \\
 \vdots \\
e^{\lambda_nt} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This somewhat inelegant equation demonstrates that all solutions of an ''n-cell'' multi-compartment model with constant or no inputs are of the form:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{A}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
e^{\lambda_2t} \\
 \vdots \\
e^{\lambda_nt} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''nxn'' matrix and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are constants.
Where &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
 a &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Model topologies==
Generally speaking, as the number of compartments increase, it is challenging both to find the algebraic and numerical solutions of the model. However, there are special cases of models, which rarely exist in nature, when the topologies exhibit certain regularities that the solutions become easier to find. The model can be classified according to the interconnection of cells and input/output characteristics:

#'''Closed model''': No sinks or source, lit. all ''k''&lt;sub&gt;oi&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0;
#'''Open model''': There are sinks or/and sources among cells.
#'''Catenary model''': All compartments are arranged in a chain, with each pool connecting only to its neighbors. This model has two or more cells.
#'''Cyclic model''': It's a special case of the catenary model, with three or more cells, in which the first and last cell are connected, i.e. ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0 or/and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0.
#'''Mammillary model''': Consists of a central compartment with peripheral compartments connecting to it. There are no interconnections among other compartments. 
#'''Reducible model''': It's a set of unconnected models. It bears great resemblance to the computer concept of '''forest''' as against '''trees'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6485">'''Multiplicity''' ({{lang-fr|multiplicité}}) is an assertion that there is more than one geo-[[historical trajectory]]. It is a philosophical concept developed by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Henri Bergson]] from [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s description of the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|mathematical concept]].&lt;ref&gt;"It was Riemann in the field of physics and mathematics who dreamed about the notion of 'multiplicity' and other different kinds of multiplicities. The philosophical importance of this notion then appeared in Husserl's ''Formal and Transcendental Logic'', as well as in Bergson's ''Essay on the Immediate Given of Awareness''" (Deleuze 1986, 13).&lt;/ref&gt; It forms an important part of the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]], particularly in his collaboration with [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–80). In his ''Foucault'' (1986), Deleuze describes [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969) as "the most decisive step yet taken in the theory-practice of multiplicities."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 14).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The philosopher Jonathan Roffe describes Deleuze's concept of Multiplicity as follows: "A  multiplicity  is,  in  the  most  basic  sense,  a  complex  structure  that does not reference a prior unity. Multiplicities are not parts of a greater whole that have been fragmented, and they cannot be considered manifold expressions of a single concept or transcendent unity. On these grounds, Deleuze opposes the dyad One/Many, in all of its forms, with multiplicity. Further, he insists that the crucial point is to consider multiplicity in its substantive form – a multiplicity – rather than as an adjective – as multiplicity of something. Everything for Deleuze is a multiplicity in this fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deleuze Dictionary: the revised edition|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze argues in his commentary ''Bergsonism'' (1966) that the notion of multiplicity forms a central part of Bergson's critique of philosophical [[Negativity (philosophy)|negativity]] and the [[dialectic]]al method. The theory of multiplicities, he explains, must be distinguished from traditional philosophical problems of "the One and the Multiple."&lt;ref&gt;"Multiplicity remains completely indifferent to the traditional problems of the multiple and the one, and above all to the problem of a subject who would think through this multiplicity, give it conditions, account for its origins, and so on. There is neither one nor multiple, which would at all events entail having recourse to a consciousness that would be regulated by the one and developed by the other" (Deleuze 1986, 14).&lt;/ref&gt; By opposing "the One and the Multiple," dialectical philosophy claims "to reconstruct the real," but this claim is false, Bergson argues, since it "involves abstract concepts that are much too general."&lt;ref&gt;See Deleuze (1966, 38-47); The dialectical method "compensates for the inadequacy of a concept that is too broad or too general by invoking the opposite concept, which is no less broad and general [. . .]. The concrete will never be attained by combining the inadequacy of one concept with the inadequacy of its opposite. The singular will never be attained by correcting a generality with another generality" (Deleuze 1966, 44).&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of referring to "the Multiple in general", Bergson's theory of multiplicities distinguishes between two types of multiplicity: continuous multiplicities and discrete multiplicities (a distinction that he developed from [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1966, 39).&lt;/ref&gt; The features of this distinction may be tabulated as follows:

In [[finance]], '''negative amortization''' (also known as '''NegAm''', '''deferred interest''' or '''[[Graduated payment mortgage loan|graduated payment mortgage]]''') occurs whenever the loan payment for any period is less than the interest charged over that period so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases.  As an [[amortization]] method the shorted amount (difference between interest and repayment) is then added to the total amount owed to the lender. Such a practice would have to be agreed upon before shorting the payment so as to avoid default on payment.  This method is generally used in an introductory period before loan payments exceed interest and the loan becomes self-amortizing. The term is most often used for [[mortgage loan]]s; corporate loans with negative amortization are called [[PIK loan]]s.

Amortization refers to the process of paying off a debt (often from a loan or mortgage) through regular payments. A portion of each payment is for interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance. The percentage of interest versus principal in each payment is determined in an [[amortization schedule]].

==Defining characteristics==
Negative amortization only occurs in loans in which the periodic payment does not cover the amount of interest due for that loan period. The unpaid [[accrued interest]] is then capitalized monthly into the outstanding principal balance. The result of this is that the loan balance (or principal) increases by the amount of the unpaid interest on a monthly basis.  The purpose of such a feature is most often for advanced cash management and/or more simply payment flexibility, but not to increase overall affordability.

Neg-Ams also have what is called a recast period, and the recast principal balance cap is in the U.S. based on Federal and State legislation. The recast period is usually 60 months (5 years). The recast principal balance cap (also known as the "neg am limit") is usually up to a 25% increase of the amortized loan balance over the original loan amount. States and lenders can offer products with lesser recast periods and principal balance caps; but cannot issue loans that exceed their state and federal legislated requirements under penalty of law.

A newer loan option has been introduced which allows for a 40-year loan term. This makes the minimum payment even lower than a comparable 30-year term.

==Special cases==

* '''[[Reverse mortgage]]''': In the extreme or limiting case of the principle of negative amortization, the borrower in a loan does not need to make payments on the loan until the loan comes due; that is, all interest is capitalized, and the original principal and all interest accrued as of the due date are paid off together and at once.  The most common context in which this arrangement occurs is that of using residential single-family real estate as collateral for the loan, in which case the loan is known as a [[reverse mortgage]].  In the United States of America, the terms of reverse mortgages are heavily regulated by federal law, which as of January 2016 places a lower age limit on the set of permitted borrowers and requires that the mortgage come due only when the borrower no longer uses the property in question as his/her principal residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hecm/rmtopten.cfm Reverse Mortgages - Top Ten Things to Know - HUD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; usually due to the borrower's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the specificity of the reverse-mortgage concept and the limited context in which the term appears in practice, most United States authorities use the term "negative amortization" to denote those and only those loans in which the borrower pays throughout the lifetime of the loan but during and only during its early stages, known as the negative-amortization or "NegAm" period, makes what are in effect partial payments, namely payments lower than the amount of interest accrued during the payment term.

==Typical circumstances==
All NegAM home loans eventually require full repayment of principal and interest according to the original term of the mortgage and note signed by the borrower.  Most loans only allow NegAM to happen for no more than 5 years, and have terms to "Recast" (see below) the payment to a fully amortizing schedule if the borrower allows the principal balance to rise to a pre-specified amount.

This loan is written often in high cost areas, because the monthly mortgage payments will be lower than any other type of financing instrument.

Negative amortization loans can be high risk loans for inexperienced investors.  These loans tend to be safer in a falling rate market and riskier in a rising rate market.

Start rates on negative amortization or minimum payment option loans can be as low as 1%. This is the payment rate, not the actual interest rate. The payment rate is used to calculate the minimum payment. Other minimum payment options include 1.95% or more.

==Adjustable rate feature==
NegAM loans today are mostly straight [[adjustable rate mortgage]]s (ARMs), meaning that they are fixed for a certain period and adjust every time that period has elapsed; e.g., one month fixed, adjusting every month.  The NegAm loan, like all adjustable rate mortgages, is tied to a specific financial index which is used to determine the interest rate based on the current index and the margin (the [[Markup (business)|markup]] the lender charges).  Most NegAm loans today are tied to the Monthly Treasury Average, in keeping with the monthly adjustments of this loan.  There are also Hybrid ARM loans in which there is a period of fixed payments for months or years, followed by an increased change cycle, such as six months fixed, then monthly adjustable.

The '''[[Graduated payment mortgage loan|graduated payment mortgage]]''' is a "fixed rate" NegAm loan, but since the payment increases over time, it has aspects of the ARM loan until amortizing payments are required.

The most notable differences between the traditional payment option ARM and the hybrid payment option ARM are in the start rate, also known as the "minimum payment" rate.  On a Traditional Payment Option Arm, the minimum payment is based on a principal and interest calculation of 1% - 2.5% on average.

The start rate on a hybrid payment option ARM is higher, yet still extremely competitive payment wise.

On a hybrid payment option ARM, the minimum payment is derived using the "interest only" calculation of the start rate.  The start rate on the hybrid payment option ARM typically is calculated by taking the fully indexed rate (actual note rate), then subtracting 3%, which will give you the start rate.

Example:   7.5% fully indexed rate − 3% = 4.5%  (4.5% would be the start rate on a hybrid pay option ARM)

This guideline can vary among lenders.

Aliases the payment option ARM loans are known by:
* PayOption ARM 
* Negative Amortizing Loan  (Neg Am)
* Pick - A - Pay
* Deferred interest option loan  (this is the way this loan was introduced to the mortgage industry when first created)

==Mortgage terminology==
* Cap
: Percentage rate of change in the NegAm payment.  Each year, the minimum payment due rises.  Most minimum payments today rise at 7.5%.   Considering that raising a rate 1% on a mortgage at 5% is a 20% increase, the NegAm can grow quickly in a rising market.  Typically after the 5th year, the loan is recast to an adjustable loan due in 25 years. This is for a 30 year loan term. Newer payment option loans often offer a 40 year term with a higher underlying interest rate.
* Life cap
: The maximum interest rate allowed after recast according to the terms of the note.  Generally most NegAm loans in the last 5 years have a life cap of 9.95%.  Today many of these loans are capped at 12% or above.
(In general Author is using time references that are relative to a time frame that is not defined. 'Today' which is?; 'last 5 years' from when, etc.)
* Index
: The variable, such as the [[Cost of funds index|COFI]]; COSI; CODI or often MTA, which determines the adjustment as an increase or decrease in the interest rate. Other examples include the LIBOR and TREASURY.
* Margin
: Often disclosed in the adjustable rate rider of a Deed of Trust, the margin is determined by the lender and is used to calculate the interest rate.  Often the loan originator can increase the margin when structuring the product for the borrower.  An increase to the margin will also increase the borrower's interest rate, but will improve the [[yield spread premium]] which the loan originator may receive as compensation from the lender.
* Fully indexed rate (F.I.R.)
: The fully indexed rate is the sum of the margin and the current index value at the time of adjustment. The F.I.R. is the "interest rate" and determines the interest only, 30 year and 15 year amortized payments.  Most adjustable rate products have caps on rate adjustments.  If the note provides for a single adjustment not to exceed an increase by more than 1.5, and the variable index, for example, increased by 2.5 since the last adjustment, the fully indexed rate will top out at a maximum adjustment of 1.5, as stated in the note, for that particular adjustment period.  Often the F.I.R. is used to determine the debt to income ratio when qualifying a borrower for this loan product.
* Payment options
: There are typically 4 payment options (listed from highest to lowest):
:* 15 year payment
:** Amortized over a period of 15 years at the F.I.R.
:* 30 year payment
:** Amortized over a period of 30 years at the F.I.R.
:* Interest only payment
:** F.I.R. times the principal balance, divided by 12 months (with no amortization or reduction in the owed balance).
:* Minimum payment
:** Based on the minimal start rate determined by the lender.  When paying the minimum payment, the difference between the interest only payment and the minimum payment is deferred to the balance of the loan increasing what is owed on the mortgage.
* Period
: How often the NegAm payment changes.  Typically, the minimum payment rises once every twelve months in these types of loans.  Usually the rate of rise is 7.5%.  The F.I.R. is subject to adjusting with the variable Index, most often on a monthly basis, depending on the product.
* Recast
: Premature stop of NegAm.  Should the balance increase to a predetermined amount (from 110% up to 125% of the original balance per federal or state regulations) the loan will be "recast" with one of two payment options: the fully amortized principal and interest payment, or if the maximum balance has been reached before the fifth year, an interest only payment until the loan has matured to the recast date (typically 5 years).
* Stop
: End of NegAm payment schedule.

==Criticisms==
Negative-amortization loans, being relatively popular only in the last decade, have attracted a variety of criticisms:
* Unlike most other adjustable-rate loans, many negative-amortization loans have been advertised with either teaser or artificial, introductory interest rates or with the minimum loan payment expressed as a percentage of the loan amount.  For example, a negative-amortization loan is often advertised as featuring "1% interest", or by prominently displaying a 1% number without explaining the F.I.R.  This practice has been done by large corporate lenders.  This practice has been considered deceptive for two different reasons:  most mortgages do not feature [[teaser rate]]s, so consumers do not look out for them; and, many consumers aren't aware of the negative amortization side effect of only paying 1% of the loan amount per year.  In addition, most negative amortization loans contain a clause saying that the payment may not increase more than 7.5% each year, ''except'' if the 5-year period is over or if the balance has grown by 15%.  Critics say this clause is only there to deceive borrowers into thinking the payment could only jump a small amount, whereas in fact the other two conditions are more likely to occur.
* Negative-amortization loans as a class have the highest potential for what is known as payment shock.  Payment shock is when the required monthly payment jumps from one month to the next, potentially becoming unaffordable.  To compare various mortgages' payment-shock potential (note that the items here do not include escrow payments for insurance and taxes, which can cause changes in the payment amount):
** 30-year (or 15-year) fixed-rate fully amortized mortgages: no possible payment jump.
** 5-year adjustable-rate fully amortized mortgage: No payment jump for 5 years, then a possible payment decrease or increase based on the new interest rate.
** A 10-year interest only mortgage product, recasting to a 20-year amortization schedule (after ten years of interest-only payments) could see a payment increase of up to $600 on a balance of 330K.
** Negative amortization mortgage: no payment jump either until 5 years OR the balance grows 15% (depending on the product) higher than the original amount.  The payment increases, by requiring a full interest-plus-principal payment.  The payment could further increase due to interest-rate changes.  However, all things being equal, the fully amortized payment is almost triple the negatively amortized payment.
** First month free: a loan officer may allow the borrower to skip the first monthly payment on a refinance loan, by simply adding that payment to the principal and charging [[compound interest]] on it for many years.  The borrower may not understand or question the transaction.

In a very hot real estate market a buyer may use a negative-amortizing mortgage to purchase a property with the plan to sell the property at a higher price before the end of the "negam" period.  Therefore, an informed investor could purchase several properties with minimal monthly obligations and make a great profit over a five-year plan in a rising real-estate market.

However, if the property values decrease, it is likely that the borrower will owe more on the property than it is worth, known colloquially in the mortgage industry as "being underwater". In this situation, if the property owner cannot make the new monthly payment, he or she may be faced with foreclosure or having to refinance with a very high [[loan-to-value ratio]], requiring additional monthly obligations, such as mortgage insurance, and higher rates and payments due to the adversity of a high loan-to-value ratio.

It is very easy for borrowers to ignore or misunderstand the complications of this product when being presented with minimal monthly obligations that could be from one half to one third what other, more predictable, mortgage products require.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13082">'''Neo-medievalism''' (or '''neomedievalism''', '''new medievalism''') is a term with a long history&lt;ref&gt;"neo-medieval", s.v. "neo-, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 27 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; that has acquired specific technical senses in two branches of scholarship. In political theory about modern [[international relations]], where the term is originally associated with [[Hedley Bull]], it sees the political order of a globalized world as analogous to high-medieval Europe, where neither states nor the Church, nor other territorial powers, exercised full sovereignty, but instead participated in complex, overlapping and incomplete sovereignties.&lt;ref name=Kobrin&gt;Stephen J. Kobrin. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.131.6106&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Back to the Future: Neomedievalism and the Postmodern Digital World Economy"].&lt;/ref&gt; In literary theory about the use and abuse of texts and tropes from the Middle Ages in [[postmodernity]]. The use of ''neomedieval'' in this sense was popularized by the Italian medievalist [[Umberto Eco]] in his 1986 essay "Dreaming of the Middle Ages".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], "Dreaming of the Middle Ages," in ''Travels in Hyperreality'', transl. by W. Weaver, NY: Harcourt Brace, 1986, pp. 61–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==
The idea of neomedievalism in political theory was first discussed in 1977 by theorist [[Hedley Bull]] in ''[[The Anarchical Society|The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics]]'' to describe the erosion of state [[sovereignty]] in the contemporary globalized world:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also conceivable that sovereign states might disappear and be replaced not by a world government but by a modern and secular equivalent of the kind of universal political organisation that existed in Western Christendom in the Middle Ages. In that system no ruler or state was sovereign in the sense of being supreme over a given territory and a given segment of the Christian population; each had to share authority with vassals beneath, and with the Pope and (in Germany and Italy) the Holy Roman Emperor above. The universal political order of Western Christendom represents an alternative to the system of states which does not yet embody universal government.&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Bull, ''The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics'', 3rd edn (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), pp. 245–46 [first publ. London: Macmillan, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus Bull suggested society might move towards "a new mediaevalism" or a "neo-mediaeval form of universal political order", in which individual notions of rights and a growing sense of a "world common good" were undermining [[Nation-state|national]] [[sovereignty]]. He proposed that such a system might help "avoid the classic dangers of the system of sovereign states by a structure of overlapping structures and cross-cutting loyalties that hold all peoples together in a universal society while at the same time avoiding the concentration inherent in a world government", though "if it were anything like the precedent of Western Christendom, it would contain more ubiquitous and continuous violence and insecurity than does the modern states system".&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Bull, ''The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics'', 3rd edn (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), p. 246 [first publ. London: Macmillan, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;

In this reading, [[globalization]] has resulted in an international system which resembles the medieval one, where political authority was exercised by a range of non-territorial and overlapping agents, such as religious bodies, [[principalities]], [[empires]] and [[city-states]], instead of by a single political authority in the form of a state which has complete sovereignty over its territory. Comparable processes characterising Bull's "new medievalism" include the increasing powers held by regional organisations such as the [[European Union]], as well as the spread of sub-national and devolved governments, such as those of [[Scotland]] and [[Catalonia]]. These challenge the exclusive authority of the state. [[Private military companies]], [[multinational corporations]] and the resurgence of worldwide religious movements (e.g. [[political Islam]]) similarly indicate a reduction in the role of the state and a decentralisation of power and authority.

[[Stephen J. Kobrin]] in 1998 added the forces of the digital world economy to the picture of neomedievalism. In an article entitled "Back to the Future: Neomedievalism and the Postmodern Digital World Economy" in the ''Journal of International Affairs'',&lt;ref name="Kobrin" /&gt; he argued that the sovereign state as we know it{{snd}}defined within certain territorial borders{{snd}}is about to change profoundly, if not to wither away, due in part to the digital world economy created by the Internet, suggesting that cyberspace is a trans-territorial domain operating outside of the jurisdiction of national law.

[[Anthony Clark Arend]] also argued in his 1999 book ''Legal Rules and International Society'' that the international system is moving toward a "neo-medieval" system. He claimed that the trends that Bull noted in 1977 had become even more pronounced by the end of the twentieth century. Arend argues that the emergence of a "neo-medieval" system would have profound implications for the creation and operation of international law.

Although Bull originally envisioned neomedievalism as a positive trend, it has its critics. [[Bruce Holsinger]] in ''Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror'' argues that [[neoconservative]]s "have exploited neomedievalism's conceptual slipperiness for their own tactical ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html|title=Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|accessdate=2017-12-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102062453/http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html|archivedate=2017-01-02|deadurl=no|quote=While international-relations theorists promote neomedievalism as a model for understanding emergent modes of global sovereignty, neoconservatives exploit its conceptual slipperiness for their own tactical ends.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Philip G. Cerny's "Neomedievalism, Civil War and the New Security Dilemma" (1998) also sees neomedievalism as a negative development and claims that the forces of globalization increasingly undermine nation-states and interstate forms of governance "by cross-cutting linkages among different economic sectors and social bonds,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerny|first=Philip G.|date=1998|title=Neomedievalism, civil war and the new security dilemma: Globalisation as durable disorder |url= |journal=Civil Wars|volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=42 |doi=10.1080/13698249808402366 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling globalization a "durable disorder" which eventually leads to the emergence of the new security dilemmas that had analogies in the Middle Ages. Cerny identifies six characteristics of a neomedieval world that contribute to this disorder: multiple competing institutions; lack of exogenous territorializing pressures both on sub-national and international levels; uneven consolidation of new spaces, cleavages, conflicts and inequalities; fragmented loyalties and identities; extensive entrenchment of property rights; and spread of the "grey zones" outside the law as well as black economy.

==Neo-medievalism and medieval studies==
{{See also|Medievalism}}
An early use of the term ''neo-medievalism'' in a sense like Umberto Eco's was in [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s 1953 "[[The Hedgehog and the Fox]]": &lt;blockquote&gt;There is no kinship between him [[Joseph de Maistre|[Joseph de Maistre]]] and those who really did believe in the possibility of some kind of return{{snd}} neo-medievalists from Wackenroder and Görres and Cobbett to G. K. Chesterton, and Slavophils and Distributists and Pre-Raphaelites and other nostalgic romantics; for he believed, as Tolstoy also did, in the exact opposite: in the "inexorable" power of the present moment: in our inability to do away with the sum of conditions which cumulatively determine our basic categories, an order which we can never fully describe or, otherwise than by some immediate awareness of it, come to know.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy’s View of History'' (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1953), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Then, in 1986, Umberto Eco said "we are at present witnessing, both in Europe and America, a period of renewed interest in the Middle Ages, with a curious oscillation between fantastic neomedievalism and responsible philological examination".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recently, the term has been used by various writers such as [[medievalist|medieval historians]] who see it as the intersection between popular fantasy and [[Middle Ages|medieval history]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ketterer (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA211&amp;lpg=RA1-PA211&amp;dq=%22neo+medievalism%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Q0nAw3mTxu&amp;sig=4sqtdAulyPgPJn6_sEyDsxWImLM#PRA1-PA211,M1 "Chapter 18: Fantasic Neomedievalism"] by Kim Selling, in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC Flashes of the Fantastic]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as a term describing the [[post-modern]] study of medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Cary John Lenehan. [http://www.tased.edu.au/tasonline/sca/thesis-d.htm "Postmodern Medievalism"], [[University of Tasmania]], November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread interest in medieval themes in [[popular culture]], especially [[computer games]] such as [[MMORPG]]s, [[film]]s and [[television]], [[neo-medieval music]], and popular [[literature]], has been called ''neomedieval''. Critics have discussed why medieval themes continue to fascinate audiences in a modern, heavily technological world. A possible explanation is the need for a [[romantic nationalism|romanticized historical narrative]] to clarify the confusing panorama of current political and cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eddostern.com/texts/Stern_TOME.html|author=Eddo Stern|title=A Touch of Medieval: Narrative, Magic and Computer Technology in Massively Multiplayer Computer Role-Playing Games|publisher=Tampre University Press 2002|accessdate=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have paid increasing attention to neomedievalism, in what some see as a burgeoning field of study. Important works include Carol L. Robinson and Pamela Clements 2009 paper “Living with Neomedievalism,” in ''Studies in Medievalism'',&lt;ref&gt;Carol L. Robinson and Pamela Clements, “Living with Neomedievalism,” ''Studies in Medievalism'' 18 (2009): 55–75&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and Clements’ anthology ''The Medieval in Motion: Neomedievalism in Film, Television and Electronic Games'' (forthcoming), a collection of papers from MEMS (Medieval Electronic Multimedia Organization),&lt;ref&gt;[http://medievalelectronicmultimedia.org/publications.html ''The Medieval in Motion: Neomedievalism in Film, Television and Electronic Games''] at MEMS.&lt;/ref&gt; the academic journal ''Studies in Medievalism: Defining Neomedievalism(s)'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fugelso (ed.), ''Studies in Medievalism: Defining Neomedievalism(s)'', D. S. Brewer, Cambridge, 2010. {{ISBN|9781843842286}}&lt;/ref&gt; panels at the 2009 Annual International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, Michigan included “Neomedievalist Communities” and “Gaming Neomedievally”, and it was the official focus of the entire 22nd Annual International Conference on Medievalism, “Neomedievalisms” (2007).

'''''Nirvana''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}''; [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|nibbana}}'', ''{{IAST|nibbāna}}'') is the earliest and most common term used to describe the goal of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] path.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589-590}} The literal meaning is "blowing out" or "quenching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the ultimate spiritual goal in Buddhism and marks the [[soteriological]] release from rebirths in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]''.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589-590}}{{Sfn|Keown|2004|pp=194-195}} Nirvana is part of the Third Truth on "cessation of ''[[dukkha]]''" in the [[Four Noble Truths]],{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589-590}} and the ''[[summum bonum]]'' destination of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].{{Sfn|Keown|2004|pp=194-195}}

Within the Buddhist tradition, this term has commonly been interpreted as the extinction of the "three fires",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=65}} or "three poisons",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gombrichthreefires"|According to Gombrich, the use of the term "three fires" alludes to the three fires which a brahmin householder had to keep alight, and tend daily.

Nirvana has also been deemed in Buddhism to be identical with ''[[anatta]]'' (non-self) and ''[[sunyata]]'' (emptiness) states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=82–84}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Genjun Sasaki |title=Linguistic Approach to Buddhist Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUBPAzlxJPUC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0038-0 |pages=124–125 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Hamilton |title=Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pE9lwuScpWwC |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7007-1280-9 |pages=18–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Choong1999p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun-Keat Choong|title=The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJafx7uO0VsC| year=1999| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-1649-7| pages=1–4, 85–88}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author= Ray Billington|title= Understanding Eastern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=58–60 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy|title=Awareness Bound and Unbound: Buddhist Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5KHnVVjwKQC |year=2009|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2680-8 |pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, with the development of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as the absence of the weaving (''vana'') of activity of the mind,{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} the elimination of desire, and escape from the woods, cq. the five ''[[skandha]]s'' or aggregates.

Buddhist scholastic tradition identifies two types of nirvana: ''sopadhishesa-nirvana'' (nirvana with a remainder), and ''[[parinirvana]]'' or ''anupadhishesa-nirvana'' (nirvana without remainder, or final nirvana).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=590}} The founder of Buddhism, the Buddha, is believed to have reached both these states.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=590}} 

''Nirvana'', or the liberation from cycles of rebirth, is the highest aim of the [[Theravada]] tradition. In the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the highest goal is ''[[Buddhahood]]'',  in which there is no abiding in Nirvana, but a Buddha continues to take rebirths in the world to help liberate beings from ''saṃsāra'' by teaching the Buddhist path.

==Etymology==
The term ''nirvana'' describes a state of freedom from suffering and rebirth,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}} but different Buddhist traditions have interpreted the concept in different ways.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{refn|group=quote|Buswell: "It is found in dictionaries as an English word, nirvana, and has acquired a patina that makes many assume its meaning is obvious. Yet, it is a word about which Buddhists themselves have never reached agreement.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}}} The origin is probably pre-Buddhist,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} and its etymology may not be conclusive for its meaning.{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} The term was a more or less central concept among the Jains, the Ajivikas, the Buddhists, and certain Hindu traditions, and it may have been imported into Buddhism with much of its semantic range from other [[Sramanism|sramanic]] movements.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}

Nirvana has a wide range of meanings,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}} although the literal meaning is "blowing out" or "quenching".{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} It refers both to the act and the effect of blowing (at something) to put it out, but also the process and outcome of burning out, becoming extinguished.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{refn|group=quote|Buswell: "The Sanskrit term nirvana is an action noun signifying the act and effect of blowing (at something) to put it out, to blow out, or to extinguish, but the noun also signifies the process and outcome of burning out, becoming extinguished, cooling down, and hence, allaying, calming down, and also taming, making docile. Technically, in the religious traditions of India, the term denotes the process of accomplishing and experiencing freedom from the unquenchable thirst of desire and the pains of repeated births, lives, and deaths.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}}}

The term ''nirvana'' in the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the pre-Buddhist [[Upanishad]]s. According to [[Steven Collins (Buddhist studies scholar)|Collins]], "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, is found in ancient texts of non-Buddhist Indian traditions, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Müller |title=Theosophy Or Psychological Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjiD_XWea7cC |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-07326-4 |pages=307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
The prevalent interpretation of nirvana as "extinction" is based on the etymology of ''nir√vā'' to "blow out".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=10}} ''Nir'' is a negative, while ''va'' is commonly taken to refer to "to blow".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=10}}

The term ''nirvana'' is part of an extensive metaphorical structure that was probably established at a very early age in Buddhism. According to Gombrich, the number of three fires alludes to the three fires which a Brahmin had to keep alight, and thereby symbolise life in the world, as a family-man.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} The meaning of this metaphor was lost in later Buddhism,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{refn|group=quote|Gombrich: "I hope it is not too farfetched to suggest that this may have contributed to an important development in the Mahayana: that it came to separate nirvana from bodhi, 'awakening' to the truth, Enlightenment, and to put a lower value on the former (Gombrich, 1992d). Originally nirvana and bodhi refer to the same thing; they merely use different metaphors for the experience. But the Mahayana tradition separated them and considered that nirvana referred only to the extinction of craving, with the resultant escape from the cycle of rebirth. This interpretation ignores the third fire, delusion: the extinction of delusion is of course in the early texts identical with what can be positively expressed as gnosis, Enlightenment.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66-67}}}} and other explanations of the word ''nirvana'' were sought. Not only passion, hatred and delusion were to be extinguished, but also all cankers (''asava'') or defilements (''khlesa'').{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|Not only the three fires, but also the extinction of the defilements and ''tanha'' are mentioned as ''nirvana'':{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 934-953}}

It thus signifies the extinguishing of the worldly "fires" of greed, hatred, and delusion. But the Pali commentators prefer to treat it as the negation of, or "departure from" (nikkhantatta), the entanglement (vāna) of craving, the derivation which is offered here. For as long as one is entangled by craving, one remains bound in saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and death; but when all craving has been extirpated, one attains Nibbāna, deliverance from the cycle of birth and death.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 5193-5198}}}}{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|pp=51-52, Quote: Etymologically [nirvana] means "to blow out" or "to extinguish," not transitively, but as a fire ceases to draw.

** adding the root ''√vā'' which means "to weave or sew";{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=64}} ''nirvana'' is then explained as abandoning the desire which weaves together life after life.{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|Even [[Buddhaghosa]], the great Theravada commentator, ignored the original etymological meaning of the word, and presented an interpretation of ''nirvana'' based on the root ''√vā'', "to weave."{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}}}}&lt;ref group=web name="Langheld" /&gt;

**  based on this root, ''vana'' has been metaphorically explained by Buddhist scholars as referring to the "forest of defilements",{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=64}} or the [[skandha|five aggregates]];{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} ''nirvana'' then means "escape from the aggregates",{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} or to be "free from that forest of defilements".{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|Gombrich explains that the five ''skandhas'' or aggregates are the bundles of firewood that fuel the three fires.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=67}} The Buddhist practitioner ought to "drop" these bundles, so that the fires are no longer fueled and "blow out".{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=67-68}}}}

The "blowing out" does not mean total annihilation,{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} but the extinguishing of a flame, which returns, and exists in another way.{{sfn|Schreiber|Ehrhard|Diener|2008|p=262}} The term ''nirvana'' can also be used as a verb: "he or she nirvāṇa-s," or "he or she parinirvānṇa-s" (''parinibbāyati'').{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=75}}{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: "Literally nirvāṇa means 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing', although Buddhist commentarial writings, by a play on words, like to explain it as 'the absence of craving'. But where English translations of Buddhist texts have 'he attains nirvāṇa/parinirvāṇa', the more characteristic Pali or Sanskrit idiom is a simple verb: 'he or she nirvāṇa-s' or more often 'he or she parinirvānṇa-s' (parinibbāyati). What the Pali and Sanskrit expression primarily indicates is the event or process of the extinction of the 'fires' of greed, aversion, and delusion."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=75}}}}

The term ''nirvana'', "to blow out",{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|pp=51-52}} has also been interpreted as the extinction of the "three fires",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=65}} or "three poisons",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}} namely of passion or sensuality (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]''), aversion or hate (''[[dvesha]]'') and of delusion or ignorance (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' or ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}} Another explanation of nirvana is the absence of the weaving (''vana'') of activity of the mind.{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}}

===To uncover===
Author Paul Swanson states that some contemporary Buddhism scholars have questioned the above etymologies and whether these are consistent with the core doctrines of Buddhism, particularly about ''anatman'' (non-self) and ''pratityasamutpada'' (causality).{{sfn|Swanson|1997|pp=119-124}} Matsumoto Shirō, for example, states that the original etymological root of ''nirvana'' should not be considered as nir√vā which means "extinction", but should be considered to be nir√vŗ, to "uncover".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=124}} The problem with considering it as extinction or liberation, is that it presupposes a "self" to be extinguished or liberated.{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=124}} According to Matsumoto, the original meaning of ''nirvana'' was therefore not "to extinguish" but "to uncover" the ''atman'' from that which is ''anatman'' (not atman).{{sfn|Swanson|1997|pp=123-124, Swanson cites Matsumoto Shiro (1989), Engi to ku-Nyoraizo shiso hihan [Causality and emptiness – A critique of tathagata-garbha thought], Tokyo Daizo Shuppan, pages 191-192, 195-219}} Other Buddhist scholars such as Takasaki Jikidō disagree, states Swanson, and call the Matsumoto proposal as "too far and leaving nothing that can be called Buddhist".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=124}}

===Moksha, vimutti===
''Nirvana'' is used synonymously with ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit), also ''vimoksha'', or ''vimutti'' (Pali), "release, deliverance from suffering".{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=547}}&lt;ref group=web name="Bowker-vimutti"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-Vimutti.html John Bowker (1997), ''Vimutti'', The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"''Vimoksha'' [解脱] (Skt; Jpn gedatsu ). Emancipation, release, or liberation. The Sanskrit words vimukti, mukti, and moksha also have the same meaning. Vimoksha means release from the bonds of earthly desires, delusion, suffering, and transmigration. While Buddhism sets forth various kinds and stages of emancipation, or enlightenment, the supreme emancipation is nirvana, a state of perfect quietude, freedom, and deliverance."&lt;ref group=web name="vimoksha"&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=2602 The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, ''vimoksha''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011614/http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=2602 |date=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the Pali-canon two kinds of vimutti are discerned:&lt;ref group=web name="Bowker-vimutti" /&gt; 
* ''Ceto-vimutti'', freedom of mind; it is the qualified freedom from suffering, attained through the practice of concentration meditation (samādhi). Vetter translates this as "release of the heart" which means conquering desire thereby attaining a desire-less state of living.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=63-65 with footnotes}}
* ''Pañña-vimutti'', freedom through understanding (prajña); it is the final release from suffering and the end of rebirth, attained through the practice of insight meditation (vipassanā).&lt;ref group=web name="Bowker-vimutti" /&gt;

Ceto-vimutti becomes permanent, only with the attainment of pañña-vimutti.&lt;ref group=web name="Bowker-vimutti" /&gt; According to Gombrich and other scholars, these may be a later development within the canon, reflecting a growing emphasis in earliest Buddhism on ''prajña'', instead of the liberating practice of ''dhyana''; it may also reflect a successful assimilation of non-Buddhist meditation practices in ancient India into the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=96-134}}{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=63-65 with footnotes}} According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Anālayo]], the term ''uttari''-''[[Moksha|vimutti]]'' (highest liberation) is also widely used in the early buddhist texts to refer to liberation from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Anālayo, From Craving to Liberation – Excursions into the Thought-world of the Pāli Discourses (1), 2009, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern scholars such as [[Rupert Gethin]], [[Richard Gombrich]], Donald Lopez and Paul Williams hold that nirvāṇa (''nibbana'' in Pali, also called ''nibbanadhatu'', the property of nibbana), means the 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing' of [[Three poisons|greed, aversion, and delusion]], and that this signifies the permanent cessation of [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2002), Buddhist Thought (Kindle ed.), Taylor &amp; Francis, p 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Gethin, Rupert (1998), Foundations of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (2000), Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction (Kindle ed.), Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Sue, Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [[Samyutta Nikaya]] IV 251 and SN IV 261.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|See:

According to Steven Collins, a synonym widely used for nirvana in early texts is "deathless" or "deathfree" ([[Pali]]: ''amata,'' [[sanskrit]]'': [[Amrita|amrta]]'') and refers to a condition "where there is no death, because there is also no birth, no coming into existence, nothing made by conditioning, and therefore no time."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adds that "the most common thing said about nirvana in Buddhist texts is that it is the ending of suffering ([[dukkha|''dukkha'']])."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Gethin notes, "this is not a 'thing' but an event or experience" that frees one from rebirth in [[Saṃsāra|samsara]]. According to Collins, the term is also widely used as a verb, one therefore "nirvanizes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Richard Gombrich|Gombrich]] argues that the metaphor used in the texts of flames going out, refers to fires which were kept by priests of [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanism]], and symbolize life in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard F. (2006), How Buddhism Began. The conditioned genesis of the early teachings. Second edition, Routledge, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana is also called "unconditioned" (''asankhata''), meaning it is unlike all other conditioned phenomena. 

The cycle of rebirth and suffering continues until a being attains nirvana. One requirement for ending this cycle is to extinguish the fires of attachment (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]''), aversion (''[[dvesha]]'') and ignorance (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' or ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avidya]])''. As [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states "For as long as one is entangled by [[Taṇhā|craving]], one remains bound in saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and death; but when all craving has been extirpated, one attains Nibbāna, deliverance from the cycle of birth and death."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 5188-5193}}

According to Donald Swearer, the journey to nirvana is not a journey to a "separate reality" (contra [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] or [[Jainism]]), but a move towards calm, equanimity, nonattachment and [[Anatta|nonself]].&lt;ref&gt;Loy, David R.

Thomas Kasulis notes that in the early texts, nirvana is often described in negative terms, including “cessation” (''nirodha''), “the absence of craving” (''trsnaksaya''), “detachment,” “the absence of delusion,” and “the unconditioned” (''asamskrta'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jones, Lindsay, Encyclopedia of Religion, volume 10, p. 6628.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that there is little discussion in the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early buddhist texts]] about the metaphysical nature of nirvana, since they seem to hold that metaphysical speculation is an obstacle to the goal. Kasulis mentions the [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|''Malunkyaputta sutta'']] which denies any view about the existence of the Buddha after his final bodily death, all positions (the Buddha exists after death, does not exist, both or neither) are rejected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Likewise, another sutta ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] II 161) has [[Sariputta|Sāriputta]] saying that asking the question "is there anything else?" after the physical death of someone who has attained nirvana is conceptualizing or proliferating (''[[Conceptual proliferation|papañca]]'') about that which is without proliferation (''appapañcaṃ'') and thus a kind of distorted thinking bound up with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmali, B.

In the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early texts]], the practice of the noble path and the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyanas]] was said to lead to the extinction of the three fires, and then proceed to the cessation of all discursive thoughts and apperceptions, then ceasing all feelings (happiness and sadness).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=68-69}}{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=80-81}} According to Collins, nirvana is associated with a meditative attainment called the 'Cessation of Perception/Ideation and Feeling' (''sannavedayitanirodha''), also known as the 'Attainment of Cessation' ([[Nirodha-samāpatti|''nirodhasamapatti'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In later Buddhism, dhyana practice was deemed sufficient only for the extinguishing of passion and hatred, while delusion was extinguished by insight.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66-67}}

=== As a metaphysical place or transcendent consciousness ===
[[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]] has defended the idea that nirvana in the Pali suttas refers to a kind of transformed and transcendent consciousness or discernment (''[[Vijñāna|viññana]]'') that has "stopped" (''nirodhena''). According to Harvey this nirvanic consciousness is said to be "objectless", "infinite" (''anantam''), "unsupported" (''appatiṭṭhita'') and "non-manifestive" (''anidassana'') as well as "beyond time and spatial location".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of The Buddha, in "Werner, ''The Yogi and the Mystic."'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, The Selfless Mind, p. 200-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Rune Johansson's ''The Psychology of Nirvana'' also argued that nirvana could be seen as a transformed state of mind (''citta'').&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Rune, ''The Psychology of Nirvana,'' 1969, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jain_universe.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jain_universe.JPG|thumb|In the cosmology of [[Jainism]], another [[Śramaṇa|sramana]] tradition like Buddhism, liberated beings abide in an actual place (loka) associated with nirvana.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90-92}} Some scholars have argued that originally, Buddhists held a similar view.]]
[[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|Stanislaw Schayer]], a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the [[Nikāya|Nikayas]] preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the [[Mahayana]] tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} Contrary to popular opinion, the Theravada and Mahayana traditions may be "divergent, but equally reliable records of a pre-canonical Buddhism which is now lost forever."{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}} The Mahayana tradition may have preserved a very old, "pre-Canonical" and oral Buddhist tradition, which was largely, but not completely, left out of the Theravada-canon.{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} Schayer's view saw nirvana as an immortal, deathless sphere, a transmundane reality or state.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=374-377}} [[Edward Conze]] had similar ideas about nirvana, citing sources which speak of an eternal and "invisible infinite consciousness, which shines everywhere" as point to the view that nirvana is a kind of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]].{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} A similar view was defended by M. Falk, who held that the nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within [[Saṃsāra|samsara]].{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} M. Falk argues that the early Buddhist view of nirvana is that it is an "abode" or "place" of [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]], which is gained by the enlightened.{{refn|See Digha Nikaya 15, ''Mahanidana Sutta'', which describes a nine-fold chain of causation. Mind-and-body (''nama-rupa'') and consciousness (''vijnana'') do condition here each other (verse 2 &amp; 3). In verse 21 and 22, it is stated that consciousness comes into the mother's womb, and finds a resting place in mind-and-body. {{sfn|Walshe|1995|p=223, 226}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=375}}{{refn|M.

Keith’s argument is also based on the ''Saddhatu Sutra'' as well as "passages where we have explanations of Nirvana which echo the ideas of the Upanishads regarding the ultimate reality." He also refers to the doctrine of "a consciousness, originally pure, defiled by adventitious impurities."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}|group=note}}

A similar view is also defended by C. Lindtner, who argues that in precanonical Buddhism Nirvana is:{{quote|... a place one can actually go to. It is called ''nirvanadhatu'', has no border-signs (''animitta''), is localized somewhere beyond the other six ''dhatus'' (beginning with earth and ending with ''vijñana'') but is closest to ''akasa'' and ''vijñana''. One cannot visualize it, it is ''anidarsana'', but it provides one with firm ground under one’s feet, it is dhruva; once there one will not slip back, it is ''acyutapada''. As opposed to this world, it is a pleasant place to be in, it is sukha, things work well.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{refn|group=note|Cited in Wynne (2007) p.99.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}}}}}

According to Christian Lindtner, the original and early Buddhist concepts of nirvana were similar to those found in competing [[Śramaṇa]] (strivers/ascetics) traditions such as [[Jainism]] and Upanishadic Vedism. It was not a psychological idea or purely related to a being's inner world, but a concept described in terms of the world surrounding the being, cosmology and consciousness.{{Sfn|Lindtner|1997|pp=112-113, 118-119}} All Indian religions, over time, states Lindtner evolved these ideas, internalizing the state but in different ways because early and later [[Vedanta]] continued with the metaphysical idea of [[Brahman]] and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|soul]], but Buddhism did not.{{Sfn|Lindtner|1997|pp=131-132, 110-112, 122-123}} In this view, the canonical Buddhist views on Nirvana was a reaction against early [[Precanonical Buddhism|(pre-canonical) Buddhism]], along with the assumptions of Jainism and the Upanishadic thought on the idea of personal liberation.{{Sfn|Lindtner|1997|p=129}} As a result of this reaction, Nirvana came to be seen as a state of mind, instead of a concrete place.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}} Elements of this precanonical Buddhism may have survived the canonisation, and its subsequent filtering out of ideas, and re-appeared in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]].{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}} According to Lindtner, the existence of multiple, and contradicting ideas, is also reflected in the works of [[Nagarjuna]], who tried to harmonize these different ideas. According to Lindtner, this lead him to taking a "paradoxical" stance, for instance regarding nirvana, rejecting any positive description.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}

Referring to this view, Alexander Wynne holds that there is no evidence in the [[Sutta Pitaka]] that the Buddha held this view, at best it only shows that "some of the early Buddhists were influenced by their Brahminic peers".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Wynne, 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Wynne concludes that the Buddha rejected the views of the [[Vedas]] and that his teachings present a radical departure from these [[Historical Vedic religion|brahminical]] beliefs.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Synonyms and metaphors ==
A commonly used metaphor for nirvana is that of a flame which goes out due to lack of fuel:&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as an oil-lamp burns because of oil and wick, but when the oil and wick are exhausted, and no others are supplied, it goes out through lack of fuel (''anaharo nibbayati''), so the [enlightened] monk … knows that after the break-up of his body, when further life is exhausted, all feelings which are rejoiced in here will become cool.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Collins argues that the Buddhist view of awakening reverses the [[Vedas|Vedic]] view and its metaphors. While in Vedic religion, the fire is seen as a metaphor for the good and for life, Buddhist thought uses the metaphor of fire for the [[three poisons]] and for suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the [[Fire Sermon|''Adittapariyaya Sutta'']] commonly called "the fire sermon" as well as in other similar [[Early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]]. The fire sermon describes the end of the "fires" with a refrain which is used throughout the early texts to describe nibbana:&lt;blockquote&gt;Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.028.than.html Thanissaro (1993)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|Dhammacakkapavattanasutta]],'' the third noble truth of cessation (associated with nirvana) is defined as: "the fading away without remainder and cessation of that same craving, giving it up, relinquishing it, letting it go, not clinging to it."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Collins lists some examples of synonyms used throughout the Pali texts for nibbana:&lt;blockquote&gt;the end, (the place, state) without corruptions, the truth, the further (shore), the subtle, very hard to see, without decay, firm, not liable to dissolution, incomparable, without differentiation, peaceful, deathless, excellent, auspicious, rest, the destruction of craving, marvellous, without affliction, whose nature is to be free from affliction, nibbana [presumably here in one or more creative etymology,= e.g., non-forest], without trouble, dispassion, purity, freedom, without attachment, the island, shelter (cave), protection, refuge, final end, the subduing of pride (or ‘intoxication’), elimination of thirst, destruction of attachment, cutting off of the round (of rebirth), empty, very hard to obtain, where there is no becoming, without misfortune, where there is nothing made, sorrowfree, without danger, whose nature is to be without danger, profound, hard to see, superior, unexcelled (without superior), unequalled, incomparable, foremost, best, without strife, clean, flawless, stainless, happiness, immeasurable, (a firm) standing point, possessing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unconditioned===
In the Theravada-tradition, ''nibbāna'' is regarded as an uncompounded or unconditioned (''asankhata'') [[Abhidharma|dhamma]] (phenomenon, event) which is "transmundane",{{sfn|Choong|1999|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|According to Peter Harvey, the Theravada-tradition tends to minimize mystical tendencies, but there is also a tendency to stress the complete otherness of ''nirvana'' from ''samsara''. The [[Pāli Canon]] provides good grounds for this minimalistic approach, bit it also contains material suggestive of a Vijnavada-type interpretation of ''nirvāṇa'', namely as a [[Eight Consciousnesses#Transformations of consciousness|radical transformation of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness mysticism in the discourses of the Buddha'' in Karel Werner, ''The Yogi and the Mystic; Studies in Indian and Comparative Mysticism."

It is therefore beyond our conceptions of good and evil, right and wrong, existence and non-existence. Even the word 'happiness' (sukha) which is used to describe Nirvāṇa has an entirely different sense here. Sāriputta once said: 'O friend, Nirvāṇa is happiness! Nirvāṇa is happiness!' Then Udāyi asked: 'But, friend Sāriputta, what happiness can it be if there is no sensation?' Sāriputta's reply was highly philosophical and beyond ordinary comprehension: "That there is no sensation itself is happiness'."{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 1105-1113}}}} In Theravada [[Abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] texts like the ''[[Vibhanga]],'' ''nibbana'' or the ''asankhata-dhatu'' (unconditioned element) is defined thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘What is the unconditioned element (''asankhata dhatu'')? It is the cessation of passion, the cessation of hatred and the cessation of delusion.’&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the "Snake-Simile Discourse" ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 22), where the Buddha states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Monks, this Teaching so well proclaimed by me, is plain, open, explicit, free of patchwork. In this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain, open, explicit and free of patchwork; for those who are arahants, free of taints, who have accomplished and completed their task, have laid down the burden, achieved their aim, severed the fetters binding to existence, who are liberated by full knowledge, there is no (future) round of existence that can be ascribed to them. – Majjhima Nikaya i.130 ¶ 42, Translated by Nyanaponika Thera [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html (Nyanaponika, 2006)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, for the Theravada, nirvana is uniquely the only ''asankhata'' ''dhamma'' (unconditioned phenomenon) and unlike other schools, they do not recognize different unconditioned phenomena or different types of nirvana (such as the ''apratistha'' or non-abiding nirvana of [[Mahayana]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Thích, Thiện Châu (1984) The Literature of the Personalists, p. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Thiện Châu, the Theravadins and the Pudgalavadins "remained strictly faithful to the letter of the sutras" and thus held that nirvana is the only unconditioned [[Dhamma theory|dhamma]], while other schools also posited various ''asankhata dhammas'' (such as the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadin]] view that space or ''[[Akasha|akasa]]'' was unconditioned).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

===Stages===
{{StagesFettersRebirths|right|notes=1}}
{{Main article|Four stages of enlightenment}}
The [[Theravada]] tradition identifies four progressive stages.{{refn|group=note|These four stages are: Stream-enterer (Sotapanna), Once returner (Sakadagami), Non-returner (Anagami), Worthy one (Arhat)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert E.

The first three are reborn because they still have some of the fetters, while arhat has abandoned all ten fetters and, upon death will never be reborn in any realm or world, having wholly escaped ''saṃsāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert E.

At the start, a monk's mind treats nirvana as an object (''nibbanadhatu''). This is followed by realizing the insight of three universal ''lakshana'' (marks): impermanence (''anicca''), suffering (''dukkha'') and nonself (''anatman''). Thereafter the monastic practice aims at eliminating the ten fetters that lead to rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr. |author2=Donald S.

According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, individuals up to the level of [[Anagami|non-returning]] may experience ''nibbāna'' as an object of consciousness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary to the Brahma-nimantantika Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.049.than.html#n-9 Access to Insight: Readings in Theravada Buddhism.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See for example the Jhana Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an09/an09.036.than.html Access to Insight: Readings in Theravada Buddhism.]}} Certain contemplations with ''nibbāna'' as an object of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]] lead, if developed, to the level of non-returning.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; At that point of contemplation, which is reached through a progression of [[Vipassana|insight]], if the meditator realizes that even that state is constructed and therefore impermanent, the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] are destroyed, arahantship is attained, and ''nibbāna'' is realized.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 1989, page 93"&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visuddhimagga===
The [[Theravada]] exegete [[Buddhaghosa]] says, in his ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;It is called nibbana (extinction) because it has gone away from (nikkhanta), has escaped from (nissata), is dissociated from, craving, which has acquired in common usage the name ‘fastening (vana)’ because, by ensuring successive becoming, craving serves as a joining together, a binding together, a lacing together, of the four kinds of generation, five destinies, seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of being.&lt;ref&gt;Both the stream-enterer and the once-returner abandon the first three fetters. What distinguishes these stages is that the once-returner additionally attenuates lust, hate and delusion, and will necessarily be reborn only once more.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Buddhaghosa]], ''nibbāna'' is achieved after a long process of committed application to the path of purification (Pali: ''Vissudhimagga''). The Buddha explained that the disciplined way of life he recommended to his students (''dhamma-vinaya'') is a [[gradual training]] extending often over a number of years. To be committed to this path already requires that a seed of wisdom is present in the individual. This wisdom becomes manifest in the experience of awakening (''[[bodhi]]''). Attaining ''nibbāna'', in either the current or some future birth, depends on effort, and is not pre-determined.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=87}}

In the ''Visuddhimagga'', chapter I.v.6, [[Buddhaghosa]] identifies various options within the [[Pali canon]] for pursuing a path to nirvana.{{refn|group=note|A number of the suttas referenced below as well as Buddhaghosa himself refer not explicitly to nirvana but to "the path of purification" (Pali: ''Visuddhimagga''). In Visuddhimagga, Ch. I, v. 5, Buddhaghosa notes: "Herein, ''purification'' should be understood as nibbana, which being devoid of all stains, is utterly pure" (Buddhaghosa &amp; {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}}, 1999, p. 6.)}}{{refn|group=note|These include:

And again, insight should be understood as the three contemplations of [[anicca|impermanence]], [[dukkha|pain]] and [[anatta|not-self]] [see ''[[Three marks of existence|tilakkhana]]'']; not contemplation of impermanence alone".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa and{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}}, 1999, p. 750, ''n''. 3.{{full citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The mind of the Arahant is ''nibbāna'' ===
A related idea, which finds support in the Pali Canon and the contemporary Theravada practice tradition despite its absence in the Theravada commentaries and [[Abhidhamma]], is that the mind of the arahant is itself ''nibbāna''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|There is a clear reference in the Anguttara Nikaya to a "[[luminous mind]]" present within all people, be they corrupt or pure, whether or not it itself is pure or impure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 94. The reference is at A I, 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canon does not support the identification of the "luminous mind" with nirvanic consciousness, though it plays a role in the realization of nirvāṇa.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.''

=== Modern Theravada views ===

[[K. N. Jayatilleke|K.N. Jayatilleke]], a modern [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] Buddhist philosopher, holds that nirvana must be understood by a careful study of the Pali texts. Jayatilleke argues that the Pali works show that nirvana means 'extinction' as well as 'the highest positive experience of happiness'.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Jayatilleke writes that despite the definition of nirvana as 'extinction', this does not mean that it is a kind of annihilation or a state of dormant nonentity, for this contradicts the statements of the Buddha that reject this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Jayatilleke holds that the early texts clearly proclaim that nothing can be said about the state of the Buddha after ''[[Parinirvana|paranibbana]]'' (the end of his psycho-physical personality) because "we do not have the concepts or words to describe adequately the state of the emancipated person." &lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This transcendent reality which our normal minds cannot grasp is not located in time or space, it is not causally conditioned, and beyond existence and non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Because trying to explain ''nibbana'' by means of logic is impossible, the only thing to be done is to explain how to reach it, instead of dwelling on what it "is". Explaining what happens to the Buddha after nibbana is thus said to be an [[The unanswered questions|unanswerable]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] position is also defended by [[Walpola Rahula Thero|Walpola Rahula]], who states that the question of what nirvana is "can never be answered completely and satisfactorily in words, because human language is too poor to express the real nature of the Absolute Truth or Ultimate Reality which is Nirvana."&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula affirms that nibbana is most often described in negative terms because there is less danger in grasping at these terms, such as "the cessation of continuity and becoming (''bhavanirodha'')", "the abandoning and destruction of desire and craving for these five aggregates of attachment", and "the extinction of "thirst" (''tanhakkhayo'')."&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula also affirms however that nibbana is not a negative or an annihilation, because there is no self to be annihilated and because 'a negative word does not necessarily indicate a negative state'.&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula also notes that more positive terms are used to describe nibbana such as "freedom" (''mutti'') and "truth" (''sacca'').&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula also agrees that nirvana is unconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has defended the traditional Theravada view which sees nirvana as "a reality transcendent to the entire world of mundane experience, a reality transcendent to all the realms of phenomenal existence."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, NIBBANA, https://www.dhammatalks.net/Books16/Bhikkhu_Bodhi-Nibbana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lankan philosopher [[David Kalupahana]] has taken a different position, he argues that the Buddha's "main philosophical insight" is the principle of causality ([[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]) and that this "is operative in all spheres, including the highest state of spiritual development, namely, nirvana."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Kalupahana, David J. Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kalupahana "later scholars attempted to distinguish two spheres, one in which causation prevailed and the other which is uncaused. This latter view was, no doubt, the result of a confusion in the meanings of the two terms, ''sankhata'' ('compounded') and ''paticcasamuppanna'' ('causally conditioned')."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Thus, even though nibbana is termed "''asankhata''" (un-compounded, not-put together) there is no statement in the early texts which say that nirvana is ''not'' dependently originated or is uncaused (the term would be ''appaticcasamuppana'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; He thus argues that "nirvana is a state where there is 'natural or causal happening' (''paticcasamuppada''), but not 'organized,' or 'planned' conditioning (''sankha-rana'')", as well as "a state of perfect mental health (''aroga''), of perfect happiness (''parama sukha''), calmness or coolness (''sitibhuta''), and stability (''aneñja''), etc. attained in this life, or while one is alive."&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David J. Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism, pp. 140, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahasi Sayadaw]], one of the most influential 20th century Theravada ''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]]'' teachers, states in his "''On the nature of Nibbana''" that "nibbana is perfect peace (''santi'')" and "the complete annihilation of the three cycles of defilement, action, and result of action, which all go to create mind and matter, volitional activities, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 2, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that for [[Arhat|arahants]] "no new life is formed after his decease-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahasi Sayadaw further states that nibbana is the cessation of the five aggregates which is like "a flame being extinguished". However this doesn't mean that "an arahant as an individual has disappeared" because there is no such thing as an "individual" in an ultimate sense, even though we use this term conventionally. Ultimate however, "there is only a succession of mental and physical phenomena arising and dissolving." For this reason, Mahasi Sayadaw holds that although for an arahant "cessation means the extinction of the successive rise and fall of the aggregates" this is not the view of annihilation (''uccheda-diṭṭhi'') since there is ultimately no individual to be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahasi further notes that "feeling [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Vedanā|''vedana'']]] ceases with the parinibbāna of the Arahant" and also that "the cessation of [[Ayatana|senses]] is nibbāna" (citing the ''Pañcattaya Sutta'').&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 41, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahasi also affirms that even though nibbana is the "cessation of mind, matter, and mental formations" and even the cessation of "formless consciousness", it is not nothing, but it is an "absolute reality" and he also affirms that "the peace of nibbana is real."&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 60, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Unorthodox interpretations, ''nibbana'' as ''citta'', ''viññana'' or ''atta''===
In [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Theravada]], as well as among some modern Theravada scholars, there are alternative interpretations which differ from the traditional orthodox Theravada view. These interpretations see nibbana as equivalent in some way with either a special kind of mind ([[Luminous mind|''pabhassara citta'']]) or a special consciousness called ''anidassana viññāṇa,'' "non-manifest" consciousness which is said to be 'luminous'. In one interpretation, the "luminous consciousness" is identical with nibbana.&lt;ref&gt;See also Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.''&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree, finding it to be not nibbana itself, but instead to be a kind of consciousness accessible only to [[arahants]].&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Brahmali, [http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=107 bswa.org]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806044051/http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=107|date=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Gethin]] objects to parts of Harvey's argument; [http://www.buddhistethics.org/4/gethin1.html buddhistethics.org]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616002503/http://www.buddhistethics.org/4/gethin1.html|date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teachers of the [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thai forest tradition]], such as [[Ajahn Maha Bua]] taught an idea called "original mind" which when perfected is said to exist as a separate reality from the world and the [[Skandha|aggregates]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327073822/http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf|date=2009-03-27}} (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maha Bua, the indestructible mind or ''[[citta]]'' is characterized by awareness or knowing, which is intrinsically bright ([[Luminous mind|''pabhassaram'']]) and radiant, and though it is tangled or "darkened" in samsara, it is not destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Maha Boowa, ‘Straight From the Heart,’ pp 139-40, (Thanissaro Bhikkhu trans.)&lt;/ref&gt; This mind is unconditioned, deathless and an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf (consulted 19 March 2009)p.99&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bua, this mind is impure, but when it is purified of the [[Defilement (Buddhism)|defilements]], it remains abiding in its own foundation.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Maha Boowa, ‘Straight From the Heart,’ pp 139-40, (Thanissaro Bhikkhu trans.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ajahn Maha Bua|Maha Bua]] also publicly argued (in a newspaper in 1972) that one could meet with and discuss the teachings with arahants and Buddhas of the past (and that [[Mun Bhuridatta|Ajahn Mun]] had done so) therefore positing that nibbana is a kind of higher existence.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Seeger, Martin, Phra Payutto and Debates ‘On the Very Idea of the Pali Canon’ in Thai Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]], a modern scholar-monk who is widely seen as the most influential authority on Buddhist doctrine in Thailand, has played a prominent role in arguing against the views of Maha Bua, strictly basing his views on the [[Pāli Canon|Pali canon]] to refute such notions.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

[[Ajahn Pasanno|Ajahns Pasanno]] and [[Ajahn Amaro|Amaro]], contemporary western monastics in the [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thai forest tradition]], note that these ideas are rooted in a passage in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (1.61-62) which mentions a certain "''[[Luminous mind|pabhassara citta]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro, ''The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha's Teachings on nibbāna'', page 212. Available online at [http://www.abhayagiri.org/main/book/1788/ abhayagiri.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Citing another passage from the canon which mentions a "consciousness that is signless, boundless, all-luminous" (called ''anidassana viññāṇa'') they state that this "must mean a knowing of a primordial, transcendent nature."&lt;ref name="Ajahn"&gt;Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro, ''The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha's Teachings on nibbāna'', page 131. Available online at [http://www.abhayagiri.org/main/book/1788/ abhayagiri.org].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro: "The Buddha avoided the nit-picking pedantry of many philosophers contemporary with him and opted for a more broad-brush, colloquial style, geared to particular listeners in a language which they could understand. Thus 'viññana' here can be assumed to mean 'knowing' but not the partial, fragmented, discriminative (vi-) knowing (-ñana) which the word usually implies. Instead it must mean a knowing of a primordial, transcendent nature, otherwise the passage which contains it would be self-contradictory." They then give further context for why this choice of words may have been made; the passages may represent an example of the Buddha using his "skill in means" to teach Brahmins in terms they were familiar with.&lt;ref name="Ajahn" /&gt;}}

A related view of nibbana has been defended by the American Thai forest monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]]. According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Thanissaro,]] "non-manifestive consciousness" (''anidassana viññāṇa'') differs from the kinds of consciousness associated to the six sense media, which have a "surface" that they fall upon and arise in response to.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#t-1 Access to Insight: Readings in Theravada Buddhism.]&lt;/ref&gt; In a liberated individual, this is directly experienced, in a way that is free from any dependence on conditions at all.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhukkhu's commentary on the Brahma-nimantanika Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.049.than.html#n-9 Access to Insight: Readings in Theravada Buddhism.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Thanissaro's view, the luminous, unsupported consciousness associated with nibbana is directly known by noble ones without the mediation of the mental consciousness factor in dependent co-arising, and is the transcending of all objects of mental consciousness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The British academic [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]] has defended a similar view of nibbana as ''anidassana viññāṇa''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 87, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], there is also a trend in modern Thai Theravada that argues that "nirvana is indeed the true Self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|''Atman'']]; Pali: [[Ātman (Buddhism)|''atta'']])".{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=125–7}} This dispute began when the 12th [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]] published a book of essays in 1939 arguing that while the conditioned world is ''anatta'', nibbana is ''atta''. According to Williams, this interpretation echoes the Mahayana ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras. This position was criticized by [[Buddhadasa|Buddhadhasa Bhikkhu]], who argued that the not-self (''[[anatta]]'') perspective is what makes Buddhism unique.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} Fifty years after this dispute, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] also began to teach that nibbana is not [[anatta]], but the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} According to Williams, this ''dhammakaya'' (dharma body) is "a luminous, radiant and clear Buddha figure free of all defilements and situated within the body of the meditator."{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} This view has been strongly criticized as "insulting the Buddha’s teaching" and "showing disrespect to the Pali canon" by [[Prayudh Payutto]] (In his ''The Dhammakaya case'') and this has led to fervent debates in Thai Buddhist circles.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51}}&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Another western monastic in the [[Thai Forest Tradition|thai forest tradition]], Ajahn Brahmāli, has recently written against all of these views, drawing on a careful study of the [[Nikāya|Nikāyas]]. Brahmāli concludes that the "most reasonable interpretation" of final nibbāna is "no more than the cessation of the five khandhas."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Brahmāli also notes that there is a kind of [[Samadhi|samādhi]] that is attainable only by the awakened and is based on their knowledge of nibbana (but is ''not'' nibbana itself), this meditation is what is being referred to by terms such as non-manifest consciousness (''anidassana viññāṇa'') and unestablished consciousness (''appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa'').&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;   

== In other Buddhist schools ==

=== Sthavira schools ===

The later Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] schools gave different meaning and interpretations of the term, moving away from the original metaphor of the extinction of the "three fires". The [[Sarvastivada]] Abhidharma compendium, the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahavibhasasastra]],'' says of nirvana: &lt;blockquote&gt;As it is the cessation of [[Defilement (Buddhism)|defilements]] (klesanirodha), it is called nirvana. As it is the extinction of the triple fires, it is called nirvana. As it is the tranquility of [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]], it is called nirvana. As there is separation (viyoga) from bad odor (durgandha), it is called nirvana. As there is separation from destinies (gati), it is called nirvana. Vana means forest and nir means escape. As it is the escape from the forest of the [[Skandha|aggregates]], it is called nirvana. Vana means weaving and nir means negation. As there is no weaving, it is called nirvana. In a way that one with thread can easily be woven while one without that cannot be woven, in that way one with action ([[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]) and defilements (klesa) can easily be woven into life and death while an asaiksa who is without any action and defilements cannot be woven into life and death. That is why it is called nirvana. Vana means [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|new birth]] and nir means negation. As there is no more new birth, it is called nirvana. Vana means bondage and nir means separation. As it is separation from bondage, it is called nirvana. Vana means all discomforts of life and death and nir means passing beyond. As it passes beyond all discomforts of life and death, it is called nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Soonil Hwang, the [[Sarvastivada]] school held that there were two kinds of nirodha (extinction), extinction without knowledge (''apratisamkhyanirodha'') and extinction through knowledge (''pratisamkhyanirodha''), which is the equivalent of nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sarvastivada [[Abhidharma]], extinction through knowledge was equivalent to nirvana, and was defined by its intrinsic nature ([[Svabhava|''svabhava'']]), ‘all extinction which is disjunction (''visamyoga'')’.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This dharma is defined by the [[Abhidharmakośakārikā|''Abhidharmakosha'']] as "a special understanding, the penetration (''pratisamkhyana'') of suffering and the other noble truths."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Soonil explains the Sarvastivada view of nirvana as "the perpetual separation of an impure dharma from a series of aggregates through the antidote, ‘acquisition of disjunction’ (''visamyogaprapti'')."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Sarvastivadins held that all dharmas exist in the three times, they saw the destruction of defilements as impossible and thus "the elimination of a defilement is referred to as a ‘separation’ from the series."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Soonil adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;That is to say, the acquisition of the defilement is negated, or technically ‘disjoined’ (''visamyoga''), through the power of knowledge that terminates the junction between that defilement and the series of aggregates. By reason of this separation, then, there arises ‘the acquisition of disjunction’ (''visamyogaprapti'') that serves as an antidote (''pratipaksa''), which henceforward prevents the junction between the defilement and this series.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The Sarvastivadins also held that nirvana was a real existent (''dravyasat'') which perpetually protects a series of dharmas from defilements in the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 42, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Their interpretation of nirvana became an issue of debate between them and the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantika]] school. For the Sautrantikas, nirvana "was not a real existent but a mere designation (''prajñaptisat'') and was non-existence succeeding existence (''pascadabhava'')."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; It is something merely spoken of conventionally, without an intrinsic nature (''[[svabhava]]'').&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhidharmakosha'', explaining the Sautrantika view of nirvana, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The extinction through knowledge is, when latent defilements (''anusaya'') and life (''janman'') that have already been produced are extinguished, non-arising of further such by the power of knowledge (''pratisamkhya'').&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus for the Sautrantikas, nirvana was simply the "non-arising of further latent defilement when all latent defilements that have been produced have already been extinguished."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Meanwhile, the [[Pudgalavada]] school interpreted nirvana as the single Absolute truth which constitutes "the negation, absence, cessation of all that constitutes the world in which we live, act and suffer".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Thiện Châu, for the Pudgalavadins, nirvana is seen as totally different than the compounded realm, since it the uncompounded (''asamskrta'') realm where no compounded things exist, and it is also beyond reasoning and expression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the few surviving Pudgalavada texts defines nirvana as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolute truth is the definitive cessation of all activities of speech (vac) and of all thoughts (citta). Activity is bodily action (kayakarman): speech (vac) is that of the voice (vakkarman); thought is that of the mind (manaskarman). If these three (actions) cease definitively, that is absolute truth which is Nirvana.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mahāsāṃghika ===
According to [[André Bareau|Andre Bareau]], the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school held that the nirvana reached by [[Arhat|arhats]] was fundamentally inferior to that of the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 55-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the nirvana reached by the Buddha, they held that his longevity (''ayu''), his body (''rupa, sarira'') and divine power (''tejas'') were infinite, unlimited and supramundane (''lokuttara'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dutt, Nalinaksha, Buddhist Sects in India, p. 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they held to a kind of [[docetism]] which posited that Buddhas only ''appear'' to be born into the world and thus when they die and enter nirvana, this is only a fiction. In reality, the Buddha remains in the form of a body of enjoyment (''sambhogakaya'') and continues to create many forms (''nirmana'') adapted to the different needs of beings in order to teach them through clever means (''[[upaya]]'').&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

According to Guang Xing, [[Mahāsāṃghika]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s held that there were two aspects of a Buddha's attainment: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through his skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsāṃghikas, the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] was merely one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''[[Nirmanakaya|nirmāṇakāya]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bareau also writes that for the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school, only wisdom ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]]) can reach nirvana, not samadhi. Bareau notes that this might be the source of the [[Prajnaparamita|''prajñaparamita'']] sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the [[Ekavyāvahārika]] branch of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Bareau states that both samsara and nirvana were nominal designations (''prajñapti'') and devoid of any real substance.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nalinaksha Dutt, for the [[Ekavyāvahārika]], all dharmas are conventional and thus unreal (even the absolute was held to be contingent or dependent) while for the [[Lokottaravāda|Lokottaravada]] branch, worldly dharmas are unreal but supramundane dharmas like nirvana are real.&lt;ref&gt;Dutt, Nalinaksha, Buddhist Sects in India, p. 69.

The [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] (Great Vehicle) tradition, which promotes the [[bodhisattva]] path as the highest spiritual ideal over the goal of [[Arhat|arhatship]], envisions a different view of nirvana than the [[Nikāya|Nikaya]] Buddhist schools.&lt;!---START OF NOTES---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: The Mahāyāna sūtras express two basic attitudes towards [the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle]. The first [attitude] is that the path of the disciple [sravaka] and the path of the pratyeka-buddha do lead to a kind of awakening, a release from suffering, nirvāna, and as such are real goals. These goals are, however, inferior and should be renounced for the superior attainment of buddhahood. The second attitude, classically articulated by the Lotus Sūtra, sees the goal of the disciple and the pratyeka-buddha as not true goals at all.{{refn|group=lower-roman|Gethin footnote: Also Śrīmālādevī 78–94; and Lankāvatāra Sūtra 63; cf. Herbert V. Guenther (trans.), The Jewel Ornament of Liberation (London, 1970), 4–6.}} The fact that the Buddha taught them is an example of his 'skill in means' (upaya-kauśalya) as a teacher.{{refn|group=lower-roman|Gethin footnote: On the notion of 'skill in means' see Michael Pye, Skilful Means (London, 1978); Williams, Mahāyāna Buddhism, 143–50.}} These goals are thus merely clever devices (upāya) employed by the Buddha in order to get beings to at least begin the practice of the path; eventually their practice must lead on to the one and only vehicle (eka-yāna) that is the mahāyāna, the vehicle ending in perfect buddhahood.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=228-229}}}}{{refn|group=note|The Tibetan teacher Pabongka Rinpoche presents the path in three levels (or scopes. The first stage indicates a level of understanding or ethical conduct for non-Buddhists, and the second two stages are ''nirvana'' and ''Buddhahood''. Pabongka Rinpoche: "The subject matter of these teachings can be included in the various paths of the three scopes. The small scope covers the causes to achieve the high rebirth states of the gods and humans: the ethics of abandoning the ten nonvirtues, etc. The medium scope includes the practices that will cause one to gain the definite excellence of liberation— such practices as abandoning [the first two of the] four truths, engaging in [the last two of these truths], and the practice of the three high trainings. The great scope contains the practices that bring about the definite excellence of omniscience— such practices as the development of bodhichitta, the six perfections, etc. Hence, all this subject matter forms a harmonious practice that will take a person to enlightenment and should be understood as being completely without contradiction."{{sfn|Pabongka Rinpoche|2006|loc=Kindle loc. 1790-1796}}}}&lt;!---END OF NOTES---&gt; The classic Mahāyāna view posits that there are at least two types of nirvana, holding that what is called ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;apratiṣṭhita-nirvana&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ("non-abiding", non-localized", "non-fixed") to be the highest nirvana, and more profound than ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;pratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', the ‘localized’, lesser nirvana.

According to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;apratiṣṭhita-nirvana&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is the standard Mahāyāna view of the attainment of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], which enables them to freely return to [[Saṃsāra|''samsara'']] in order to help sentient beings, while still being in a kind of nirvana.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Mahāyāna path is thus said to aim at a further realization, namely an active Buddhahood that does not dwell in a static ''nirvana'', but out of [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''[[karuṇā]]'') engages in enlightened activity to liberate beings for as long as ''samsara'' remains.{{sfn|Duckworth|2011|loc=Kindle loc. 430-436}}&lt;!---START OF NOTE---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|name=nonabiding1|From the Mahayana point of view, the ''nonabiding (apratiṣṭhita) nirvana'' is superior to the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle:
* Thubten Thardo (Gareth Sparham) states: "The term "non-abiding nirvāṇa" indicates that a fully awakened buddha is utterly free from saṃsāra, yet due to compassion has not entered into a more restricted form of nirvāṇa that precludes continued activity within the world."{{sfn|Khunu Rinpoche|2012|loc=Kindle loc. 1480-1482}}
* Erik Pema Kunsang states (based on teachings by Tulku Orgyen Rinpoche and Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche): "The lesser nirvana refers to the liberation from cyclic existence attained by a hinayana practitioner. When referring to a buddha, ''nirvana'' is the great nondwelling state of enlightenment which falls neither into the extreme of samsaric existence nor into the passive state of cessation attained by an arhant."{{sfn|Tsele Natsok Rangdrol|1987|p=114}}
* Thrangu Rinpoche states: "The samadhi with the union of samatha and vipasyana fully developed will free one from the bondage of samsara so one attains a state of nonabiding nirvana, which is Buddhahood.{{sfn|Thrangu Rinpoche|1993|p=125}}
* The Padmakara Translation Group states: "It  is important to realize that the term [nirvana] is understood differently by the different vehicles: the nirvana of the Basic Vehicle, the peace of cessation that an Arhat attains, is very different from a Buddha's "nondwelling" nirvana, the state of perfect enlightenment that transcends both samsara and nirvana."{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2011|loc=Kindle loc. 8211-8215}}
* Peter Harvey states: "An advanced Bodhisattva who has experienced Nirvana does not rest content with this. He turns again to samsara in the service of others, which the ''Mahayana-samgraha'' calls his 'non-abiding' (apratiṣṭhita) Nirvana, not clinging either to samsara or to Nirvana as something supposedly separate from this (Nagao, 1991)."{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=137}}
* Rupert Gethin states: "For the Mahayana becoming a Buddha generally involves attaining what is characterized as the 'unestablished' or 'non-abiding' (apratiṣṭhita) nirvāṇa: on the one hand the knowledge of a buddha that sees emptiness, is not 'established' in saṃsāra (by seizing on birth as an individual being, for example), on the other hand the great compassion of a buddha prevents the complete turning away from saṃsāra. So ultimately he abides neither in saṃsāra nor in nirvāṇa."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=232}}
* Duckworth: The Lesser Vehicle does not result in the practitioner becoming a complete buddha; rather, the aim is to achieve a personal nirvana that is the total extinction of existence. The Great Vehicle, however, does result in becoming a complete buddha. A buddha remains actively engaged in enlightened activity to liberate beings for as long as samsara remains. Thus, those who accomplish the Great Vehicle do not abide in samsara due to their wisdom that sees its empty, illusory nature. Further, unlike those who attain the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle to escape samsara, they do not abide in an isolated nirvana due to their compassion. For these reasons, in the Great Vehicle, nirvana is said to be "unlocated" or "nonabiding" (''apratiṣṭhita''), staying in neither samsara nor nirvana.{{sfn|Duckworth|2011|loc=Kindle loc. 430-436}}&lt;!---END OF NOTE---&gt;}} ''Apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' is said to be reached when bodhisattvas eradicate both the afflictive obstructions (''klesavarana'') and the obstructions to omniscience (''jñeyavarana''), and is therefore different than the nirvana of arhats, who have eradicated only the former.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to Alan Sponberg, ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' is "a nirvana that is not permanently established in, or bound to, any one realm or sphere of activity".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sponberg, Alan, Dynamic liberation in Yogacara Buddhism, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with a kind of nirvana which is "permanently established or fixed (''pratiṣṭhita'') in the transcendent state of nirvana-without-remainder (''nirupadhisesa-nirvana'')." According to Sponberg this doctrine developed among Yogacara Buddhists who rejected earlier views which were based on an individual liberation aimed at a transcendent state, separated from the mundane sphere of human existence. Mahayana Buddhists rejected this view as inconsistent with the universalist Mahayana ideal of the salvation of all beings and with the absolutist non-dual Mahayana perspective that did not see an ultimate distinction between samsara and nirvana.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Sponberg also notes that the [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamika]] school also had a hand in developing this idea, due to their rejection of dualistic concepts which separated samsara and nirvana and their promotion of a form of liberation which was totally without duality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

Though the idea that Buddhas remain active in the world can be traced back to the Mahasamghika school, the term ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' seems to be a Yogacara innovation. According to Gadjin Nagao, the term is likely to be an innovation of the Yogacaras, and possibly of the scholar [[Asanga]] (fl. 4th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin, M. Madhyamika and Yogacara: A Study of Mahayana Philosophies, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Sponberg states that this doctrine presents a "Soteriological Innovation in [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] Buddhism" which can be found mainly in works of the Yogacara school such as the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Sandhinirmocana-sutra]],'' the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra|Lankavatarasutra]]'', the [[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|''Mahayanasutralamkara'']], and is most fully worked out in the [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha|''Mahayana-samgraha'']] of [[Asanga]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Chapter IX of the ''samgraha'', Asanga presents the classic definition of ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' in the context of discussing the severing of mental obstacles (''avarana''):&lt;blockquote&gt;This severing is the ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' of the bodhisattva. It has as its characteristic (''laksana'') the revolution (''paravrtti'') of the dual base (''asraya'') in which one relinquishes all defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesa]]''), but does not abandon the world of death and rebirth (''samsara'').&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In his commentary on this passage, Asvabhava (6th century), states that the wisdom which leads to this state is termed non-discriminating cognition (''nirvikalpaka-jñana)'' and he also notes that this state is a union of wisdom (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]]'') and compassion (''karuna''): &lt;blockquote&gt;The bodhisattva dwells in this revolution of the base as if in an immaterial realm (''arupyadhatu''). On the one hand—with respect to his own personal interests (''svakartham'')—he is fully endowed with superior wisdom (''adhiprajña'') and is thus not subject to the afflictions (''klesa'') while on the other hand—with respect to the interests of other beings (''parartham'')—he is fully endowed with great compassion (''mahakaruna'') and thus never ceases to dwell in the world of death and re-birth (''samsara'').&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Sponberg, in Yogacara, the Buddha's special wisdom that allows participation in both nirvana and samsara, termed non-discriminating cognition (''nirvikalpaka-jñana)'' has various aspects: a negative aspect which is free from discrimination that binds one to samsara and positive and dynamic aspects which intuitively cognize the Absolute and give a Buddha "access to the Absolute without yielding efficacy in the relative."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

=== Paths to Buddhahood ===
Most sutras of the Mahāyāna tradition, states Jan Nattier, present three alternate goals of the path: [[Arhat|Arhatship]], [[Pratyekabuddha|Pratyekabuddhahood]], and [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5mWcbAXqb0C|title=The Bodhisattva Path: Based on the Ugraparipṛcchā, a Mahāyāna Sūtra|author=Jan Nattier|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2007|isbn=978-81-208-2048-7|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according an influential Mahāyāna text called the [[Lotus Sutra]], while the lesser attainment of individual ''nirvana'' is taught as a skillful means by the Buddha in order to help beings of lesser capacities; ultimately, the highest and ''only'' goal is the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=540}}{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=36}}{{sfn|Kornberg Greenberg|2008|p=88}} The Lotus sutra further states that, although these three paths are ''seemingly'' taught by Buddhas as separate vehicles (''yana''), they are really all just [[Upaya|skillful ways]] (''upaya'') of teaching a single path (''ekayana''), which is the bodhisattva path to full Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Suguro, Shinjo; Nichiren Buddhist International Center, trans. (1998), Introduction to the Lotus Sutra, Jain Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0875730787}}, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these three separate goals are not really different at all, the 'lesser' paths are actually just clever teaching devices used by Buddhas to get people to practice, eventually though, they will be led to the one and only path of Mahāyāna and full Buddhahood.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=228-229}}

The Mahāyāna commentary the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'' presents the path of the bodhisattva as a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|''Five Paths'' (''pañcamārga'').]] A practitioner on the ''Five Paths'' advances through a progression of ten stages, referred to as the bodhisattva ''[[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|bhūmis]]'' (grounds or levels).

===Omniscience===
The end stage practice of the Mahāyāna removes the imprints of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|delusions]], the obstructions to [[omniscience]] (''sarvākārajñatā''), which prevent simultaneous and direct knowledge of all phenomena. Only Buddhas have overcome these obstructions and, therefore, only Buddhas have omniscience knowledge, which refers to the power of a being in some way to have "simultaneous knowledge of all things whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Sara L. Omniscience and the Rhetoric of Reason: Santaraksita and Kamalasila on Rationality, Argumentation, and Religious Authority, 2010, p. 37.

&lt;/ref&gt; From the Mahāyāna point of view, an arhat who has achieved the nirvana of the [[Hinayana|Lesser Vehicle]] will still have certain subtle obscurations that prevent the arhat from realizing complete omniscience. When these final obscurations are removed, the practitioner will attain ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' and achieve full omniscience.{{refn|group=quote|Contemporary translator Jeffrey Hopkins provides the following analogy:"If you put garlic in a vessel, it deposits some of its odor in the vessel itself; Thus when you seek to clean the vessel, it is necessary to first remove the garlic.&lt;br&gt;Similarly, a [[Avidyā (Buddhism)#Uprooting avidya|consciousness conceiving inherent existence]], like garlic, deposits predispositions in the mind that produce the ''appearance'' of inherent existence; Thus,there is no way to cleanse the mind of those predispositions, which are like the flavor of garlic left in the vessel of the mind,until one removes all consciousnesses conceiving of inherent existence from the mind. First, the garlic must be removed; then, its odor can be removed.&lt;br&gt;For this reason, according to the [[prasangika|Consequence School]], until one has utterly removed all the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|afflictive obstructions]], one cannot begin to remove the obstructions to omniscience. Since this is the case, a practitioner cannot begin overcoming the obstructions to omniscience on any of the seven first [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva grounds]], which are called "impure" because one still has afflictive obstructions to be abandoned.&lt;br&gt;Rather, one begins abandoning the obstructions to omniscience on the eighth bodhisattva ground, and continues to do so on the ninth and tenth, these three being called the 'three pure grounds" because the afflictive obstructions have been abandoned."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery Hopkins (author).

===Buddhahood's bodies===

[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|228px|The ''[[Garbhadhatu]]'' [[mandala]] of the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]] representing multiple manifestations of the [[Dharmakaya]], the Buddha [[Vairocana]].]]
Some Mahāyāna traditions see the Buddha in [[Docetism|docetic]] terms, viewing his visible manifestations as projections from its nirvanic state. According to Etienne Lamotte, Buddhas are always and at all times in nirvana, and their corporeal displays of themselves and their Buddhic careers are ultimately illusory. Lamotte writes of the Buddhas:{{quote|They are born, reach enlightenment, set turning the Wheel of Dharma, and enter nirvana. However, all this is only illusion: the appearance of a Buddha is the absence of arising, duration and destruction; their nirvana is the fact that they are always and at all times in nirvana.'&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Lamotte, tr. Sara Boin-Webb,  ''Suramgamasamadhisutra'', Curzon, London, 1998, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

This doctrine, developed among the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahāsaṃghikas]], where the historical person, Gautama Buddha, was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''nirmāṇakāya''), while the essential Buddha is equated with the transcendental Buddha called ''[[dharmakāya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; In Mahāyāna, this eventually developed into the doctrine of the "Three Bodies" of the Buddha (''[[Trikaya]]''). This doctrine is interpreted in different ways by the different Mahāyāna traditions. According to Reginald Ray, it is "the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is."&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQMLAAAAYAAJ|title=Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet|last=Ray|first=Reginald|publisher=Shambhala|year=2001|isbn=978-1-57062-772-9|page=13|authorlink=Reginald Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha-nature===
{{See also|Buddha-nature}}

An alternative idea of Mahāyāna nirvana is found in the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]''. The title itself means a ''garbha'' (womb, matrix, seed) containing ''Tathagata'' (Buddha). These [[Sutra]]s suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or essential inner nature'.&lt;ref name="paulwilliamsp104"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|author=Paul Williams|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Buddha-nature|tathāgatagarbha]]'' doctrine ''(''also called ''buddhadhatu, buddha-nature)'', at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name="paulwilliamsp104" /&gt; Most scholars consider the ''tathāgatagarbha'' doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and it contradicts the "no self" (or no soul, no atman, anatta) doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|author=Paul Williams|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–105, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|author=Merv Fowler|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}, '''Quote:''' "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahāyāna tradition thus often discusses nirvana with its concept of the ''tathāgatagarbha'', the innate presence of Buddhahood.{{sfn|Wayman|1990}} According to Alex Wayman, Buddha nature has its roots in the idea of an innately pure [[luminous mind]] (''prabhasvara citta''{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}), "which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|''agantukaklesa'']])"{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}} lead to the development of the concept of [[Buddha-nature]], the idea that Buddha-hood is already innate, but not recognised.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}} 

The ''[[Buddha-nature|tathāgatagarbha]]'' has numerous interpretations in the various schools of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. Indian [[Madhyamaka]] philosophers generally interpreted the theory as a description of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and as a non implicative negation (a negation which leaves nothing un-negated).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karl Brunnholzl, early Indian [[Yogachara|Yogacaras]] like [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]] referred to the term as "nothing but [[Tathātā|suchness]] in the sense of twofold [[Śūnyatā|identitylessness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However some later Yogacarins like [[Ratnākaraśānti|Ratnakarasanti]] considered it "equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate as to whether ''tathāgatagarbha'' was just a way to refer to emptiness or whether it referred to some kind of mind or consciousness also resumed in [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhism,]] with some Chinese Yogacarins, like [[Fazang]] and Ratnamati supporting the idea that it was an eternal non-dual mind, while Chinese Madhyamikas like [[Jizang]] rejecting this view and seeing ''tathāgatagarbha'' as [[emptiness]] and "the middle way."&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;Hurley, Scott, The doctrinal transformation of twentieth-century Chinese Buddhism: Master Yinshun’s interpretation of the tathagatagarbha doctrine, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;Liu , Ming-Wood.

In some [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] Buddhist texts such as the ''Samputa Tantra,'' nirvana is described as purified, non-dualistic 'superior mind'.&lt;ref&gt;Takpo Tashi Namgyal, ''Mahamudra'' Shambhala, Boston and London, 1986, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] philosophy, the debate continues to this day. There are those like the [[Gelug]] school, who argue that ''tathāgatagarbha'' is just emptiness (described either as [[Dharmadhatu|''dharmadhatu'']], the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation).{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}} Then there are those who see it as the non-dual union of the mind's unconditioned emptiness and conditioned lucidity (the view of [[Gorampa]] of the [[Sakya]] school).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as the [[Jonang]] school and some [[Kagyu]] figures, see ''tathāgatagarbha'' as a kind of Absolute which "is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}}

=== ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' ===
According to some scholars, the language used in the ''tathāgatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language. Kosho Yamamoto translates the explanation of nirvana in the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' (c. 100-220 CE) as follows: 
{{quote|"O good man! We speak of "Nirvana". But this is not "Great" "Nirvana". Why is it "Nirvana", but not "Great Nirvana"? This is so when one cuts away defilement without seeing the Buddha-Nature. That is why we say Nirvana, but not Great Nirvana. When one does not see the Buddha-Nature, what there {{not a typo|is| is}} the non-Eternal and the non-Self. All that there {{not a typo|is| is}} but Bliss and Purity. Because of this, we cannot have Mahaparinirvana, although defilement has been done away with. When one sees well the Buddha-Nature and cuts away defilement, we then have Mahaparinirvana. Seeing the Buddha-Nature, we have the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and the Pure. Because of this, we can have Mahaparinirvana, as we cut away defilement."&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! "Nir" means "not"; "va" means "to extinguish". Nirvana means "non- extinction". Also, "va" means "to cover". Nirvana also means "not covered". "Not covered" is Nirvana. "Va" means "to go and come". "Not to go and come" is Nirvana. "Va" means "to take". "Not to take" is Nirvana." "Va" means "not fixed". When there is no unfixedness, there is Nirvana. "Va" means "new and old". What is not new and old is Nirvana.&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! The disciples of Uluka [i.e. the founder of the [[Vaishesika]] school of philosophy] and Kapila [founder of the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy] say: "Va means characterisitic". "Characteristiclessness" is Nirvana."&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! Va means "is". What is not "is" is Nirvana. Va means harmony. What has nothing to be harmonised is Nirvana. Va means suffering. What has no suffering is Nirvana.&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! What has cut away defilement is no Nirvana. What calls forth no defilement is Nirvana. O good man! The All-Buddha-Tathagata calls forth no defilement. This is Nirvana.

In the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the Buddha speak of four attributes which make up nirvana. Writing on this Mahayana understanding of nirvana, [[William Edward Soothill]] and [[Lewis Hodous]] state:
{{quote|'The Nirvana Sutra claims for nirvana the ancient ideas of permanence, bliss, personality, purity in the transcendental realm.

'''Peer pressure''' (or '''social pressure''') is the direct influence on people by [[peer group|peers]], or the effect on an individual who gets encouraged to follow their peers by changing their [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Value (ethics)|values]] or [[behavior]]s to [[Conformity|conform]] to those of the influencing group or individual. This can result in either a positive or negative effect. Social groups affected include both ''membership groups'', in which individuals are "formally" members (such as [[political parties]] and [[trade union]]s), and [[clique]]s, in which membership is not clearly defined. However, a person does not need to be a member or be seeking membership of a group to be affected by peer pressure.peer pressure can decrease one's confidence .It can affect the lives of the students drastically.
 
There has been considerable study regarding peer pressure's effects on children and adolescents, and in popular discourse the term is mostly used in the contexts of those age groups. For children, the common themes for study regard their abilities for independent decision making; for adolescents, peer pressure's relationship with sexual intercourse and substance abuse have been significantly researched. Peer pressure can affect individuals of all ethnicities, genders and ages, however. Peer pressure has moved from strictly [[face-to-face interaction]] to digital interaction as well. [[Social media]] offers opportunities for adolescents and adults alike to instill and/or experience pressure everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Kyungeun|last2=Park|first2=Namkee|last3=Song|first3=Hayeon|date=2016-09-01|title=Social comparison on Facebook: Its antecedents and psychological outcomes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216302539|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=62|issue=Supplement C|pages=147–154|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that not just individuals but also organizations, such as large corporations, are susceptible to peer pressures, such as pressures from other firms in their industry or headquarters city.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|journal=Organization Science |volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and adolescents ==

=== Children ===
Imitation plays a large role in children's lives; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life, children are always searching for behaviours and attitudes around them that they can co-opt. Children are aware of their position in the social hierarchy from a young age: their instinct is to defer to adults' judgements and majority opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corriveau|first=Kathleen H.|last2=Harris|first2=Paul L.|date=2010-03-01|title=Preschoolers (sometimes) defer to the majority in making simple perceptual judgments.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayrecord&amp;uid=2010-03975-012|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=English|volume=46|issue=2|pages=437–445|doi=10.1037/a0017553|issn=1939-0599|pmid=20210502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[Asch conformity experiments]], a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one.&lt;ref name="HaunTomasello2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haun|first1=Daniel B. M.|last2=Tomasello|first2=Michael|title=Conformity to Peer Pressure in Preschool Children|journal=Child Development|volume=82|issue=6|year=2011|pages=1759–1767|issn=00093920|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01666.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each child was handed a book with two sets of images on each page, with a groups of differently sized animals on the left hand page and one animal on the right hand, and each child was asked to indicate the size of the lone animal. All the books appeared the same, but the last child would sometimes get a book that was different. The children reported their size judgements in turn, and the child being tested was asked last. Before him or her, however, were a group of children working in conjunction with the researchers. Sometimes, the children who answered before the test subject  all gave an answer that was incorrect. When asked in the presence of the other children, the last child's response was often the same as his or her peers. However, when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers' pressure, illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions.&lt;ref name="HaunTomasello2011"/&gt;

An insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers' behavior through pressure. A study conducted in a remedial kindergarten class in the Edna A. Hill Child Development Laboratory in the University of Kansas designed a program to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system. After describing a series of tasks to their classroom that included bathroom usage, cleaning up, and general classroom behavior, teachers and researchers would observe children's performance on the tasks. The study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers, and looked at their responses to potential techniques. The system utilized was a two-part one: first, each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption (e.g. sitting down on a mat for reading time), and if a student reached three points by the end of the day they would receive a prize. The second part brought in peer interaction, where students who reached three points were appointed "peer monitors" whose role was to lead their small groups and assign points at the end of the day. The results were clear-cut, showing that the monitored students' disruption dropped when teachers started the points system and monitored them, but when peer monitors were introduced the target students' disruption dropped to average rates of 1% for student C1, 8% for student C2, and 11% for student C3 (down from 36%, 62%, and 59%, respectively). Even small children, then, are susceptible to pressure from their peers, and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carden Smith|first=L.

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is the/a time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence, and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience.&lt;ref&gt;B. B. Brown, "Adolescents' relationships with peers," In:  R. M. Lerner &amp; L. Steinburg (Eds.), Handbook of Adolescent Psychology, 2nd ed, New York:  Wiley, 2004, p 363-394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteinbergMonahan20072"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Monahan|first2=Kathryn C.|year=2007|title=Age differences in resistance to peer influence|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1531–1543|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1531|pmid=18020830|last1=Steinberg|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg|first1=Laurence|pmc=2779518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children entering this period in life become aware for the first time of the other people around them and realize the importance of perception in their interactions. Peer conformity in young people is most pronounced with respect to style, taste, appearance, ideology, and values.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Durkin, "Peer Pressure", In:  Anthony S. R. Manstead and Miles Hewstone (Eds.), The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social Psychology, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers.&lt;ref name="SteinbergMonahan20072" /&gt; Affiliation with friends who engage in risk behaviors has been shown to be a strong predictor of an adolescent's own behavior.&lt;ref name="SpearKulbok20012"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kulbok|first2=Pamela A|year=2001|title=Adolescent Health Behaviors and Related Factors: A Review|journal=Public Health Nursing|volume=18|issue=2|pages=82–93|doi=10.1046/j.1525-1446.2001.00082.x|pmid=11285102|last1=Spear|first1=Hila J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior, such as volunteering for charity &lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Hanes, "Teens and volunteering:  Altruism or just peer pressure?" The Christian Science Monitor, October 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or excelling in academics.&lt;ref&gt;Kellie B. Gormly, "Peer Pressure -- for students and adults -- can be positive," Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, March 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of peers declines upon entering adulthood.&lt;ref name="BrownEicher19862"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Eicher|first2=Sue Ann|last3=Petrie|first3=Sandra|year=1986|title=The importance of peer group ("crowd") affiliation in adolescence|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=9|issue=1|pages=73–96|doi=10.1016/S0140-1971(86)80029-X|last1=Brown|first1=B. Bradford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though socially accepted children often have the most opportunities and the most positive experiences, research shows that social acceptance (being in the popular crowd) may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, depending on the norms in the group. Groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky, drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups. Peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers, making them more susceptible to group pressures.&lt;ref name="AllenPorter20052"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Porter|first2=Maryfrances R.|last3=McFarland|first3=F.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this link is well established, moderating factors do exist. For example, parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use; yet when there is little monitoring, adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use, but not during the transition from experimental to regular use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Fletcher|first2=Anne|last3=Darling|first3=Nancy|date=1 June 1994|title=Parental Monitoring and Peer Influences on Adolescent Substance Use|journal=Pediatrics|volume=93|page=1060|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511527906.016|last1=Steinberg|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg|first1=Laurence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring, and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Darling|first2=Nancy|date=1999|title=Leisure Context, Parental Control, and Resistance to Peer Pressure as Predictors of Adolescent Partying and Substance Use: An Ecological Perspective|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/748|journal=Journal of Leisure Research|volume=31|issue=1|last1=Caldwell|first1=Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2002|title=Friends: The Role of Peer Influence Across Adolescent Risk Behaviors|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=31|issue=4|pages=267–277|doi=10.1023/A:1015493316865|last1=Maxwell|first1=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer pressure produces a wide array of negative outcomes. Allen and colleagues showed that susceptibility to peer pressure in 13- and 14-year-olds was predictive of not only future response to peer pressure, but also a wider array of functioning.&lt;ref name="AllenPorter20062"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Porter|first2=Maryfrances R.|last3=McFarland|first3=F.

Of note, substance use was also predicted by peer pressure susceptibility such that greater susceptibility was predictive of greater alcohol and drug use.

==== Smoking ====

Substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone. Evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Prescott|first2=Carol A.|last3=Myers|first3=John|last4=Neale|first4=Michael C.|date=September 2003|title=The Structure of Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Common Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders in Men and Women|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=60|issue=9|pages=929–937|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.60.9.929|last1=Kendler|first1=Kenneth S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence. In a nationally representative sample, adolescents who had genetic predisposition were more likely to have good friends who were heavy substance users and were furthermore, more likely to be vulnerable to the adverse influence of these friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hill|first2=Jennifer E.|last3=Turkheimer|first3=Eric|last4=Emery|first4=Robert E.|date=27 March 2008|title=Gene-Environment Correlation and Interaction in Peer Effects on Adolescent Alcohol and Tobacco Use|journal=Behavior Genetics|volume=38|issue=4|pages=339–347|doi=10.1007/s10519-008-9202-7|last1=Harden|first1=K. Paige|pmc=2898558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from specific candidate gene studies have been mixed. For instance, in a study of nicotine use Johnson and colleagues found that peer smoking had a lower effect on nicotine dependence for those with the high risk allele (CHRNA5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Chen|first2=Li-Shiun|last3=Breslau|first3=Naomi|last4=Hatsukami|first4=Dorothy|last5=Robbins|first5=Tania|last6=Saccone|first6=Nancy L.|last7=Grucza|first7=Richard A.|last8=Bierut|first8=Laura J.|date=November 2010|title=Peer smoking and the nicotinic receptor genes: an examination of genetic and environmental risks for nicotine dependence|journal=Addiction|volume=105|issue=11|pages=2014–2022|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03074.x|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric O.|pmid=20840187|pmc=2970633}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that social contexts do not play the significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance as it may for others and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well.

==== Drinking ====

Though the impact of peer influence in adolescence has been well established, it was unclear at what age this effect begins to diminish. It is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure. Using the Resistance to Peer Influence Scale, Sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bokhorst|first2=Caroline L.|last3=Steinberg|first3=Laurence|last4=Westenberg|first4=P. Michiel|date=August 2009|title=The developmental pattern of resistance to peer influence in adolescence: Will the teenager ever be able to resist?|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=32|issue=4|pages=1009–1021|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2008.08.010|last1=Sumter|first1=Sindy R.|authorlink3=Laurence Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found that girls were generally more resistant to peer influence than boys, particularly at mid-adolescence (i.e. ages 13–15). The higher vulnerability to peer pressure for teenage boys makes sense given the higher rates of substance use in male teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=He|first2=Jian-ping|last3=Burstein|first3=Marcy|last4=Swanson|first4=Sonja A.|last5=Avenevoli|first5=Shelli|last6=Cui|first6=Lihong|last7=Benjet|first7=Corina|last8=Georgiades|first8=Katholiki|last9=Swendsen|first9=Joel|date=October 2010|title=Lifetime Prevalence of Mental Disorders in U.S. Adolescents: Results from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication–Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=10|pages=980–989|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017|last1=Merikangas|first1=Kathleen Ries|pmc=2946114}}&lt;/ref&gt; For girls, increased and positive parental behaviors (e.g. parental social support, consistent discipline) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Chassin|first2=Laurie|date=March 2000|title=Peer Influence on Adolescent Alcohol Use: The Moderating Role of Parental Support and Discipline|journal=Applied Developmental Science|volume=4|issue=2|pages=80–88|doi=10.1207/S1532480XADS0402_3|last1=Marshal|first1=Michael P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

it is believed that peer pressure of excessive drinking in college comes down to three factors; being offered alcohol, modeling and social norms. Offering alcohol can be both as a kind gesture or the other extreme which is forceful. Then you have the modeling which is being a “copycat” and following your friends then finally you have the social norms which are drinking. There are two reasons why people do it; because everyone does it, or as a means to fit into social groups. on entering college most people begin to increase their amount of alcohol intake, this is more so true to those who do not live at home. This would be because you have shifted from being influenced by your parents to being influenced by your college peers. (Borsari and Carey, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borsari|first1=Brian|last2=Carey|first2=Kate|title=Peer influences on college drinking: A review of the research|date=December 2001|volume=13|issue=4|pages=Pages 391–424|doi=10.1016/s0899-3289(01)00098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====

Substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure. One major technique is, naturally, peer influence resistance skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1986|title=Meta-analysis of 143 adolescent drug prevention programs: Quantitative outcome results of program participants compared to a control or comparison group|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=104318|journal=Journal of Drug Issues|volume=16|issue=4|pages=537–567|last1=Tobler|first1=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen Graham2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Graham|first2=John W.|date=May 1991|title=Preventing alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use among adolescents: Peer pressure resistance training versus establishing conservative norms|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=20|issue=3|pages=414–430|doi=10.1016/0091-7435(91)90039-7|last1=Hansen|first1=William B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The known correlational relationship between substance use and relationships with others that use makes resistance skills a natural treatment target. This type of training is meant to help individuals refuse participation with substance use while maintaining their membership in the peer group. Other interventions include normative education approaches (interventions designed to teach students about the true prevalence rates and acceptability of substance use),&lt;ref name="Hansen Graham2" /&gt; education interventions that raise awareness of potential dangers of substance use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ireland|first2=Diana|last3=Lowe|first3=Geoff|last4=Breen|first4=Rosie|title=Primary prevention for alcohol misuse in young people|journal=Protocols|publisher=Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003024|last1=Foxcroft|first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; alcohol awareness training and classroom behavior management.

However, this effect started to wear off with programs that targeted older students. Programs that targeted students in grades 8–9 reduced smoking, but not alcohol and other drug abuse, and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Onrust|first=Simone A.|last2=Otten|first2=Roy|last3=Lammers|first3=Jeroen|last4=Smit|first4=Filip|date=2016-03-01|title=School-based programmes to reduce and prevent substance use in different age groups: What works for whom?

In a non-substance context, however, research has showed that decision-making training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khemka|first=Ishita|last2=Hickson|first2=Linda|last3=Mallory|first3=Sarah B.|date=2016-03-18|title=Evaluation of a Decision-Making Curriculum for Teaching Adolescents with Disabilities to Resist Negative Peer Pressure|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-016-2770-0|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|language=en|volume=46|issue=7|pages=2372–2384|doi=10.1007/s10803-016-2770-0|issn=0162-3257}}&lt;/ref&gt; can produce concrete gains in risk perception and decision-making ability among autistic children. When administered the training in several short sessions that taught the children how to recognize risk from peers and react accordingly, the children showed through post-training assessments that they were able to identify potential threats and sources of pressure from peers and deflect them far better than normal adolescents in a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=03b5d6c0-72fb-4b4a-a868-5924d7afc04a@sessionmgr4008&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=2016-14179-001&amp;db=psyh|title=Evaluation of a decision-making curriculum for teaching adolescents with di...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer pressure and sexual intercourse ===
There is evidence supporting the conclusion that parental attitudes disapproving sex tends to lead toward lower levels of adolescent unplanned pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Teen Preg2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = ((Hampton Mary &amp; Jeffery)), Mcwatters B, Smith P, ((Parenthood Planned)) |title=Influence of Teens' Perceptions of Parental Disapproval and Peer Behaviour on Their Initiation of Sexual Intercourse|journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|volume=14|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228462762_Influence_of_teens%27_perceptions_of_parental_disapproval_and_peer_behavior_on_their_initiation_of_sexual_intercourse|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities are not due solely to parental disposition but also to communication.

A study completed in Cape Town, South Africa, looked at students at four secondary schools in the region. They found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure: condoms are derided, threats of ridicule for abstinence, and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol (especially for males). The students colloquially call others who choose abstinence as "umqwayito", which means dried fruit/meat. An important solution for these problems is communication with adults, which the study found to be extremely lacking within adolescent social groups.&lt;ref name="pmid19493988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Selikow TA, Ahmed N, Flisher AJ, Mathews C, Mukoma W | title = I am not "umqwayito'': a qualitative study of peer pressure and sexual risk behaviour among young adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa | journal = Scand J Public Health | volume = 37 Suppl 2 | issue = | pages = 107–12 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19493988 | doi = 10.1177/1403494809103903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyze the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors. A review conducted by Bongardt et al. defined three types of peer norms that led to a person's participation in sexual intercourse: descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and outright peer pressure. Descriptive norms and injunctive norms are both observed behaviors and are thus more indirect forms of pressure, but differ in one key aspect: descriptive norms describe peers' sexual behaviors, but injunctive norms describe peers' attitudes toward those behaviors (e.g. approval or disapproval). The last norm defined by the study is called "peer pressure" by the authors, and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person's peers to engage in sexual behavior.

The review found that indirect norms (descriptive and injunctive) had a stronger effect on a person's decision to engage in sexual behavior than direct peer pressure. Between the two indirect norms, descriptive norms had a stronger effect: people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bongardt|first=Daphne van de|last2=Reitz|first2=Ellen|last3=Sandfort|first3=Theo|last4=Deković|first4=Maja|date=2015-08-01|title=A Meta-Analysis of the Relations Between Three Types of Peer Norms and Adolescent Sexual Behavior|url=http://psr.sagepub.com/content/19/3/203|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=203–234|doi=10.1177/1088868314544223|issn=1088-8683|pmid=25217363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, studies have found a link between self-regulation and likeliness to engage in sexual behavior. The more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up, the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts. Based on these findings, it may be a good idea to prevent these through either a decision-making program or by targeting adolescents' ability to self-regulate against possible risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crockett|title=Linking Self-Regulation and Risk Proneness to Risky Sexual Behavior: Pathways through Peer Pressure and Early Substance Use|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1131&amp;context=psychfacpub|journal=Faculty Publications, Department of Psychology|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural mechanisms ==
From a purely neurological perspective, the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC) and the [[striatum]] play an important role in figuring out the value of specific actions. The mPFC is active when determining "socially tagged" objects, which are objects that peers have expressed an opinion about; the striatum is significant for determining the value of these "socially tagged" objects and rewards in general. An experiment performed by Mason et al. utilizing fMRI scans analyzed individuals who were assigned to indicate if a chosen symbol appeared consecutively. The researchers did not tell the subjects the real purpose of the experiment, which was to collect data regarding mPFC and striatum stimulation. Before the actual experiment began, the subjects were subject to a phase of "social" influence, where they learned which symbols were preferred by other subjects of completed the experiment (while in actuality these other subjects did not exist). Mason et al. found that determining an object's social value/significance is dependent on combined information from the mPFC and the striatum [along the lines denoted in the beginning of the paragraph]. Without both present and functional, it would be difficult to determine the value of action based upon social circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Malia|last2=Dyer|first2=Rebecca|last3=Norton|first3=Michael|title=Neural Mechanisms of Social Influence|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=110|pages=152–159|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar experiment was conducted by Stallen, Smidts, and Sanfrey. Twenty-four subjects were manipulated using a [[minimal group paradigm]] approach. Unbeknownst to them, they were all selected as part of the "in-group", although there was an established "out-group". Following this socialization, the subjects estimated the number of dots seen on the screen while given information about what an in-group or out-group member chose. Participants were more likely to conform to in-group decisions as compared to out-group ones. The experiment confirmed the importance of the striatum in social influence, suggesting that conformity with the in-group is mediated with a fundamental value signal—rewards. In other words, the brain associates social inclusion with positive reward. The [[Superior temporal sulcus|posterior superior temporal sulcus]] (pSTS), which is associated with perspective taking, appeared to be active as well, which correlated with patients' self-reports of in-group trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stallen|first=Mirre|last2=Smidts|first2=Ale|last3=Sanfey|first3=Alan|title=Peer influence: neural mechanisms underlying in-group conformity|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=7|issue=50|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adolescence, risk-taking appears to increase dramatically. Researchers conducted an experiment with adolescent males who were of driving age and measured their risk-taking depending on whether a passenger (a peer of the same age) was in the car. A driving simulation was created, and certain risky scenarios, such as a decaying yellow light as the car was approaching, were modeled and presented to the subjects. Those who were most likely to take risks in the presence of peers (but took fewer risks when there were no passengers) had greater brain activity in the social-cognitive and social-affective brain systems during solo activity (no passengers.) The social-cognitive aspect refers to the ability to gauge what others are thinking and is primarily controlled by the mPFC, [[Temporoparietal junction|right temporal parietal junction]], and the [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate cortex]]. The social-affective aspect relates to the reward system for committing actions that are accepted or rejected by other people. One side of the reward system is "social pain",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=Naomi I.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Matthew D.|last3=Williams|first3=Kipling D.|date=2003-10-10|title=Does Rejection Hurt?

== Social media ==

=== Social Media ===
[[Social media]] provides a massive new digital arena for peer pressure and influence.

As a result, the power and impact of digital peer pressure may vary throughout the world. Overall, there is limited research on this topic and its global scope.

== In history ==

=== Holocaust ===
[[The Holocaust]] is probably the most well-known of genocides. In the 1940s, Nazi [[Germany]], led by Adolf Hitler, began a systematic purge against the Jewish people living in Europe, killing around six million Jews by the end of [[World War II]]. It is clear that some Germans are culpable for the Holocaust; SS officers and soldiers clearly bought into the Jewish genocide and participated as executioners, jailers, and hunters (for hiding Jews).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, a broader statement is harder to make—as seen below, not all Germans wanted to kill the Jews. When bringing the concept of peer pressure into the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], German culpability is even harder to decide.

The primary issue revolves around collective responsibility and beliefs. As such, there are two positions, most notably held by Christopher Browning and David Goldhagen.

==== Browning's ''Ordinary Men'' ====
[[Christopher Browning]], most known for his book ''Ordinary Men: [[Reserve Police Battalion 101]]'', relies on an analysis of the men in Reserve Police Battalion 101. The men of the 101st were not ardent Nazis but ordinary middle-aged men of working-class background from Hamburg. They were drafted but found ineligible for regular military duty. Their test as an Order Police battalion first came in the form of Jozefow, a Jewish ghetto in Poland. The Battalion was ordered to round up the men in the ghetto and kill all women, children, and elderly on sight. During the executions, a few dozen men were granted release of their execution tasks and were reassigned to guard or truck duty. Others tried to stall as long as possible, trying not to be assigned to a firing squad. After the executions were completed, the men drank heavily, shaken by their ordeal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland|last=Browning|first=Christopher|publisher=Penguin|year=1998|isbn=978-0060995065|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his book, Browning supplies his theory on 101's actions: a combination of authoritative and peer pressure was a powerful coercive tool. First, the Nazi leadership wanted to keep the country's soldiers psychologically healthy, so soldiers were not forced to commit these murders. Throughout the German ranks, nothing negative happened to the soldiers and policemen who refused to join in on a firing squad or Jewish search party. They would simply be assigned other or additional duties, and perhaps subject to a little verbal abuse deriding their "cowardice". For the officers, no official sanction was given, but it was well known that being unable to carry out executions was the sign of a "weak" leader, and the officer would be passed for promotions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders|last=Klee|first=Ernst|last2=Dressen|first2=Willi|last3=Reiss|first3=Volker|publisher=The Free Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1568521336|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Major Trapp, the head of Battalion 101, consistently offered protection from committing these actions, even so far as supporting one man who was blatantly and vocally against these practices. He established "ground" rules in which only volunteers were taking on 'Jewish Hunts" and raids.

Browning relies on [[Milgram experiment|Milgram's experiments]] on authority to expand his point. Admitting that Trapp was not a particularly strong authority figure, Browning instead points to the Nazi leadership and the orders of the "highest order" that were handed down. Furthermore, according to Browning's analysis, one reason so few men separated themselves from their task was peer pressure—individual policemen did not want to "lose face" in front of their comrades. Some argued that it was better to shoot one and quit than to be a coward immediately. Some superior officers treated those who did not want to execute Jews with disdain; on the other hand, those selected for the executions or Jewish hunts were regarded as real "men" and were verbally praised accordingly. For some, refusing their tasks meant that their compatriots would need to carry the burden and the guilt of abandoning their comrades (as well as fear of ostracization) compelled them to kill.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Goldhagen's ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' ====
David Goldhagen, disagreeing with Browning's conclusion, decided to write his own book, ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]''.  Its release was highly controversial. He argues that the Germans were always anti-Semitic, engaging in a form of "eliminationism". Taking photos of the deceased, going on "Jew-Hunts", death marches near the end of the war, and a general focus on hate (rather than ignorance) are points Goldhagen utilizes in his book.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen 32–37"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldhagen|first=Daniel Jonah|last2=Wohlgelernter|first2=Maurice|title=Hitler’s willing executioners|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02823096|journal=Society|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=32–37|doi=10.1007/BF02823096|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He does not believe that peer pressure or authoritative pressure can explain why ordinary Germans engaged in these actions. He believes that in order for the policemen in Battalion 101 (and those in similar situations) to kill, they must all be fully committed to the action—no half-heartedness. As he notes,&lt;blockquote&gt;"For that matter, for someone to be pressured into doing something, by peer pressure, everyone else has to want to do it. Peer pressure can, of course, operate on isolated individuals, or small groups, but it depends upon the majority wanting to do it. So the peer pressure argument contradicts itself. If the majority of the people hadn't wanted to kill Jews, then there would have been peer pressure not to do it" (37).&lt;ref name="Goldhagen 32–37"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Instead, he places a significant emphasis on the German people's anti-Semitism, to the extent of drawing ire from other historians. Browning notes Goldhagen's "uniform portrayal" of Germans, dehumanizing all of the perpetrators without looking at the whole picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Browning|first=Christopher|year=1996|title=Daniel Goldhagen's Willing Executioners|url=|journal=History and Memory|volume=8|pages=88–108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the town of Niezdow, the Police Battalion executed over a dozen elderly Poles in retaliation for the murder of a German policeman. It is less clear, then, if the Germans in the Police Battalion are antagonistic only towards Jews. The German-Canadian historian [[Ruth Bettina Birn]] has—in collaboration with Volker Rieß— checked Goldhagen's archival sources from Ludwigsburg. Their findings confirm the arbitrary nature of his selection and evaluation of existing records as opposed to a more holistic combination of primary sources. Furthermore, [[Konrad Kwiet]], a Holocaust historian, argues that Goldhagen's narrow focus on German anti-Semitism has blinded him to other considerations. He points to the massacres of non-Jews as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Goldhagen does not shine light] on the motives of “Hitler’s willing executioners” in murdering handicapped people within the so-called “Euthanasia Program”, in liquidating 2.7 million Soviet prisoners of war, in exterminating Romas or in killing hundreds of thousands of other people classified as enemies of the “German People and Nation”. The emphasis on German responsibility allows Goldhagen to push aside the willingness of genocidal killers of other nationalities [such as Latvians] who, recruited from the vast army of indigenous collaborators, were often commissioned with the task of carrying out the ‘dirty work’, such as the murder of women and children, and who, in many cases, surpassed their German masters in their cruelty and spontaneous brutality" (27).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KWIET|first=KONRAD|year=1997|title=Goldhagen, the Germans, and the Holocaust|url=|journal=Journal of Jewish Affairs|volume=133|pages=7–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rwandan genocide ===
The [[Rwandan genocide]] occurred in 1994, with ethnic violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnicities. The primary belligerents were the Hutu; however, as with most ethnic conflict conflicts, not all Hutu wanted to kill Tutsi. A survivor named Mectilde described the Hutu breakdown as follows: 10% helped, 30% forced, 20% reluctant, and 40% willing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhavnani|first=Ravi|date=2006-11-01|title=Ethnic Norms and Interethnic Violence: Accounting for Mass Participation in the Rwandan Genocide|url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/43/6/651|journal=Journal of Peace Research|language=en|volume=43|issue=6|pages=651–669|doi=10.1177/0022343306069290|issn=0022-3433}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the willing, a rewards structure was put in place. For the unwilling, a punishment system was in effect. The combination, Professor Bhavnani argues, is a behavioral norm enforced by in-group policing. Instead of the typical peer pressure associated with western high school students, the peer pressure within the Rwandan genocide, where Tutsi and Hutu have inter-married, worked under coercion. Property destruction, rape, incarceration, and death faced the Hutu who were unwilling to commit to the genocide or protected the Tutsi from violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When looking at a sample community of 3426 in the village of Tare during the genocide, McDoom found that neighborhoods and familial structures as important micro-spaces that helped determine if an individual would participate in violence. Proximity increases the likelihood of social interaction and influence. For example, starting at a set point such as the home of a "mobilizing" agent for the Hutu (any individual who planned or led an attack in the village), the proportion of convicts living in a 100m radius of a resident is almost twice as many for convicts (individuals convicted of genocide by the ''gacaca'', a local institution of transitional justice that allows villagers to adjudicate on many of the perpetrators’ crimes by themselves) as for non-convicts. As the radius increases, so does the proportion decrease. This data hints that "social influence" was at play. Looking at neighborhoods, an individual is 4% more likely to join the genocide for every single percentage point increase in the proportion of convicted perpetrators living within a 100m radius of them. Looking at familial structures, for any individual, each percentage point increase in the proportion of genocide participants in the individual's household increased his chances of joining the violence by 21 to 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDoom|first=Omar Shahabudin|date=2013-07-01|title=Who killed in Rwanda’s genocide? Micro-space, social influence and individual participation in intergroup violence|url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/50/4/453|journal=Journal of Peace Research|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=453–467|doi=10.1177/0022343313478958|issn=0022-3433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the complete situation is a little more nuanced. The extreme control of citizens' daily lives by the government in social affairs facilitated the rapidity of the genocide's spread and broke down the resolve of some who initially wanted to have no part in the genocide. First, prior to the genocide, Rwandans' sense of discipline was introduced and reinforced through weekly ''umuganda'' (collective work) sessions, involving praise for the regime and its leaders and a host of collective activities for the community. Respect for authority and the fear of stepping out of line were strong cultural values of pre-genocide Rwanda and so were included in these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hintjens|first=Helen|year=1999|title=Explaining the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=37|pages=241–286|via=|doi=10.1017/s0022278x99003018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, their value of social conformity only increased in the decades leading up to the genocide in both social and political manners. Peasants were told exactly when and what to farm and could be fined given any lack of compliance. These factors helped to drive the killing's fast pace.

Most importantly, there were already ethnic tensions among the groups for a variety of reasons: conflicts over land allocation (farming versus pasture) and declining prices of Rwanda's main export: coffee. These problems combined with a history of previously existing conflict. With the introduction of the Second Republic under Habyarimana, former Tutsis in power were immediately purged, and racism served as an explanation as keeping the majority Hutu in legitimate government power.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uvin|first=Peter|date=1997-01-01|title=Prejudice, Crisis, and Genocide in Rwanda|journal=African Studies Review|volume=40|issue=2|pages=91–115|doi=10.2307/525158|jstor=525158}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when the war came, the Hutu were already introduced to the concept of racism against their very own peers.

The division in Rwanda was reinforced for hundreds of years. King Kigeli IV, a Tutsi, centralized Rwandan power in the 1800s, just in time for German colonization. The Germans furthered the message of distinct races, allowing Tutsi men to remain the leaders in the society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Leadership tool ===

==== Education ====
  Principals who served as strong "instructional" leaders and introduced new curricula and academic programs were able to create a system of peer pressure at the teaching level, where the teachers placed accountability pressure on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Stephen|last2=Johnson|first2=Lauri|last3=Ylimaki|first3=Rose|last4=Giles|first4=Corrie|title=Successful leadership in challenging US schools: enabling principles, enabling schools|journal=Journal of Educational Administration|volume=43|issue=6|pages=607–618|doi=10.1108/09578230510625700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voting ===
Peer pressure can be especially effective (more so than door-to-door visits and telephone calls) in getting people to vote. Gerber, Green, and Larimer conducted a large-scale field experiment involving over 180,000 Michigan households in 2006 and four treatments: one was a reminder to vote, one was a reminder to vote and a note informing them that they were being studied, one that listed the voting records for all potential household individuals, and finally one that listed the voting records for the household individuals and their neighbors. The final treatment emphasized peer pressure within a neighborhood; neighbors could view each other's voting habits with the lists, and so the social norm of "voting is best for the community" is combined with the fear that individuals' peers would judge their lack of voting. Compared to a baseline rate of 29.7% (only the voting reminder), the treatment that utilized peer pressure increased the percentage of household voters by 8.1% (to 37.8%), which exceeds the value of in-person canvassing and personalized phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerber|first=Alan S.|last2=Green|first2=Donald P.|last3=Larimer|first3=Christopher W.|date=2008-02-01|title=Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/social-pressure-and-voter-turnout-evidence-from-a-large-scale-field-experiment/11E84AF4C0B7FBD1D20C855972C2C3EB|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=102|issue=1|pages=33–48|doi=10.1017/S000305540808009X|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar large-scale field experiment conducted by Todd Rogers, Donald P. Green, Carolina Ferrerosa Young, and John Ternovski (2017)&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;Rogers, T., Green, D. P., Ternovski, J., &amp; Young, C. F. (2017). Social pressure and voting: A field experiment conducted in a high-salience election. Electoral Studies , 46 (2017), 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt; studied the impact of a social pressure mailing in the context of a high-salience election, the 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. Social pressure mailers included the line, “We’re sending this mailing to you and your neighbors to publicize who does and does not vote.”&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt; This study found a treatment effect of 1.0 percentage point, a statistically significant but far weaker effect than the 8.1 percentage point effect reported by Gerber, Green, and Larimer.&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt; The 2017 study’s effects were particularly sizable for low-propensity voters.&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt;

=== Charitable donations ===
An experiment conducted by Diane Reyniers and Richa Bhalla measured the amount donated by a group of London School of Economics students. The group was split into individual donators and pair donators. The donation amounts were revealed within each pair; then, the pair was given time to discuss their amounts and then revise them as necessary. In general, pair subjects donated an average of 3.64 pounds (Sterling) while individuals donated an average of  2.55 pounds. Furthermore, in pairs where one subject donated significantly more than the other, the latter would on average increase the donation amount by 0.55 pounds. This suggests that peer pressure "shames" individuals for making smaller donations.  But when controlling for donation amount, paired subjects were significantly less happy with their donation amount than individual subjects—suggesting that paired subjects felt coerced to donate more than they would have otherwise. This leads to a dilemma: charities will do better by approaching groups of people (such as friends); however, this could result in increased donor discomfort, which would impact their future donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reyniers |first=Diane |last2=Bhalla |first2=Richa |year=2013 |title=Reluctant altruism and peer pressure in charitable giving|url=|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|volume=8|issue=1|pages=7–15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational researchers have found a generally similar phenomenon among large corporations: executives and managers of large companies look to similar organizations in their industry or headquarters city to figure out the appropriate level of corporate charitable donations, and those that make smaller donations might be seen as stingy and suffer damage to their reputations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Perceptual learning''' is [[learning]] better [[perception]] skills such as differentiating two [[musical tone]]s from one another or categorizations of spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise 
as in [[Reading (process)|reading]], seeing relations among [[chess]] pieces, knowing whether or not an [[X-ray]] image shows a tumor.

[[Sensory modalities]] may include [[visual]], auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. Perceptual learning forms important foundations of complex [[cognitive]] processes (i.e., language) and interacts with other kinds of learning to produce perceptual expertise.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellman|first=P.

==Examples==

===Basic sensory discriminations===
Laboratory studies reported many examples of dramatic improvements in sensitivities from appropriately structured perceptual [[learning]] tasks. In visual [[Vernier acuity]] tasks, observers judge whether one line is displaced above or below a second line. Untrained observers are often already very good with this task, but after training, observers' [[absolute threshold|threshold]] has been shown to improve as much as 6 fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westheimer | first1 = G | last2 = McKee | first2 = SP | year = 1978 | title = Stereoscopic acuity for moving retinal images | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 450–455 | doi = 10.1364/JOSA.68.000450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saarinen | first1 = J | last2 = Levi | first2 = DM | year = 1995 | title = Perceptual learning in vernier acuity: What is learned? | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 519–527 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6989(94)00141-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poggio | first1 = T. | last2 = Fahle | first2 = M. | last3 = Edelman | first3 = S | year = 1992 | title = Fast perceptual learning in visual hyperacuity | url = | journal = Science | volume = 256 | issue = | pages = 1018–21 | doi = 10.1126/science.1589770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar improvements have been found for visual motion discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = K | last2 = Sekuler | first2 = R | year = 1982 | title = A specific and enduring improvement in visual motion discrimination | url = | journal = Science | volume = 218 | issue = 4573| pages = 697–698 | doi = 10.1126/science.7134968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and orientation sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiu | first1 = LP | last2 = Pashler | first2 = H | year = 1992 | title = Improvement in line orientation discrimination is retinally local but dependent on cognitive set | url = | journal = Percept Psychophysics | volume = 52 | issue = 5| pages = 582–588 | doi = 10.3758/BF03206720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogels | first1 = R | last2 = Orban | first2 = GA | year = 1985 | title = The effect of practice on the oblique effect in line orientation judgments | url = | journal = Vision Res | volume = 25 | issue = 11| pages = 1679–1687 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6989(85)90140-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[visual search]] tasks, observers are asked to find a target object hidden among distractors or in noise. Studies of perceptual [[learning]] with visual search show that experience leads to great gains in sensitivity and speed. In one study by Karni and Sagi,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the time it took for subjects to search for an oblique line among a field of horizontal lines was found to improve dramatically, from about 200ms in one session to about 50ms in a later session. With appropriate practice, visual search can become automatic and very efficient, such that observers do not need more time to search when there are more items present on the search field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = W. | last2 = Shiffrin | first2 = R.M. | year = 1977 | title = Controlled and automatic human information processing: I.

===In the natural world===
Perceptual learning is prevalent and occurs continuously in everyday life. As our perceptual system adapts to the natural world, we become better at discriminating between different stimuli when they belong to different categories than when they belong to the same category. We also tend to become less sensitive to the differences between two instances of the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldstone | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Hendrickson | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Categorical perception | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 69–78 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are described as the result of [[Category learning|categorical perception]]. Categorical perception effects do not transfer across domains.

Infants, when different sounds belong to the same phonetic category in their native language, tend to lose sensitivity to differences between speech sounds by 10 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = J.F. | last2 = Lalonde | first2 = C.E. | year = 1988 | title = Cross-language speech perception: initial capabilities and developmental change | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 672–83 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.24.5.672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn to pay attention to salient differences between native phonetic categories, and ignore the less language-relevant ones.

In chess, expert chess players encode larger chunks of positions and relations on the board and require fewer exposures to fully recreate a chess board. This is not due to their possessing superior visual skill, but rather to their advanced extraction of structural patterns specific to chess.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, A.D. (1965).

In speech phonemes, observers who listen to a continuum of equally spaced consonant-vowel syllables going from /be/ to /de/ are much quicker to indicate that two syllables are different when they belonged to different phonemic categories than when they were two variants of the same phoneme, even when physical differences were equated between each pair of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberman | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Harris | first2 = K.S. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = H.S. | last4 = Griffith | first4 = B.C. | year = 1957 | title = The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phonemes boundaries | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 5| pages = 358–368 | doi=10.1037/h0044417 | pmid=13481283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
The fact that with huge amounts of practice, individuals can reach impressive perceptual expertise, whether in wine tasting, fabric evaluation or musical preference, has been well acknowledged for centuries, along with the prevalent idiom that "practice makes perfect". The first documented report, dating to the mid-19th century, is the earliest example of tactile training aimed at decreasing the minimal distance at which individuals can discriminate whether one or two points on their skin have been touched. It was found that this distance ([[JND]], Just Noticeable Difference) decreases dramatically with practice, and that this improvement is at least partially retained on subsequent days. Moreover, this improvement is at least partially specific to the trained skin area. A particularly dramatic improvement was found for skin positions at which initial discrimination was very crude (e.g. on the back), though training could not bring the JND of initially crude areas down to that of initially accurate ones (e.g. finger tips).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volkman | first1 = A. W. | year = 1858 | title = Über den Einfluss der Übung | url = | journal = Leipzig Ber Math-Phys Classe | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 38–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James]] devoted a section in his Principles of Psychology (1890/1950) to "the improvement in discrimination by practice".&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=W|year=1890|title=The principles of psychology|volume=I|place=New York|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|page=509|doi=10.1037/11059-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted examples and emphasized the importance of perceptual learning for expertise. In 1918, [[Clark L. Hull]], a noted learning theorist, trained human participants to learn to categorize deformed Chinese characters into categories. For each category, he used 6 instances that shared some invariant structural property. People learned to associate a sound as the name of each category, and more importantly, they were able to classify novel characters accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hull|first=C.L.|year=1920|chapter=Quantitative aspects of evolution of concepts|title=Psychological monographs|volume=XXVIII|issue=1.123|pages=1–86|pmc=1362740}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to extract invariances from instances and apply them to classify new instances marked this study as a perceptual learning experiment. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EleanorGibson1.jpg|thumb|Eleanor Gibson]] --&gt;
It was not until 1969, however, that [[Eleanor Gibson]] published her seminal book ''The Principles of Perceptual learning and Development'' and defined the modern field of perceptual learning. She established the study of perceptual learning as an inquiry into the behavior and mechanism of perceptual change. By the mid-1970s, however, this area was in a state of dormancy due to a shift in focus to perceptual and cognitive development in infancy. Much of the scientific community tended to underestimate the impact of learning compared with innate mechanisms. Thus, most of this research focused on characterizing basic perceptual capacities of young infants rather than on perceptual learning processes.

Since the mid-1980s, there has been a new wave of interest in perceptual learning due to findings of cortical plasticity at the lowest sensory levels of sensory systems. Our increased understanding of the physiology and anatomy of our cortical systems has been used to connect the behavioral improvement to the underlying cortical areas. This trend began with earlier findings of [[David H. Hubel|Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] that perceptual representations at sensory areas of the cortex are substantially modified during a short ("critical") period immediately following birth. Merzenich, Kaas and colleagues showed that though [[neuroplasticity]] is diminished, it is not eliminated when the critical period ends.&lt;ref name="Merzenich1983"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Merzenich MM, Kaas JH, Wall JT, Sur M, Nelson RJ, Felleman DJ |year=1983 |title=Progression of change following median nerve section in the cortical representation of the hand in areas 3b and 1 in adult owl and squirrel monkeys |journal=Neuroscience |pmid=6646426 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=639–65 |doi=10.1016/0306-4522(83)90208-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when the external pattern of stimulation is substantially modified, neuronal representations in lower-level (e.g. [[primary sensory areas|primary]]) sensory areas are also modified. Research in this period centered on basic sensory discriminations, where remarkable improvements were found on almost any sensory task through discrimination practice. Following training, subjects were tested with novel conditions and learning transfer was assessed. This work departed from earlier work on perceptual learning, which spanned different tasks and levels.

A question still debated today is to what extent improvements from perceptual learning stems from peripheral modifications compared with improvement in higher-level readout stages. Early interpretations, such as that suggested by [[William James]], attributed it to higher-level categorization mechanisms whereby initially blurred differences are gradually associated with distinctively different labels. The work focused on basic sensory discrimination, however, suggests that the effects of perceptual learning are specific to changes in low-levels of the sensory nervous system (i.e., primary sensory cortices).&lt;ref&gt;Fahle Manfred  (Editor), and Tomaso Poggio (Editor), ''Perceptual Learning''. The MIT Press (2002: p. xiv){{ISBN|0262062216}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, research suggest that perceptual learning processes are multilevel and flexible.&lt;ref name ="Petrov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrov | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Dosher | first2 = B. A. | last3 = Lu | first3 = Z.-L. | year = 2005 | title = The Dynamics of Perceptual Learning: An Incremental Reweighting Model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 112 | issue = 4| pages = 715–743 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.715 | pmid=16262466}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycles back to the earlier Gibsonian view that low-level learning effects are modulated by high-level factors, and suggests that improvement in information extraction may not involve only low-level sensory coding but also apprehension of relatively abstract structure and relations in time and space.

Within the past decade, researchers have sought a more unified understanding of perceptual learning and worked to apply these principles to improve perceptual learning in applied domains.

==Characteristics==

===Discovery and fluency effects===
Perceptual learning effects can be organized into two broad categories: discovery effects and fluency effects.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002" /&gt; Discovery effects involve some change in the bases of response such as in selecting new information relevant for the task, amplifying relevant information or suppressing irrelevant information. Experts extract larger "chunks" of information and discover high-order relations and structures in their domains of expertise that are invisible to novices. Fluency effects involve changes in the ease of extraction. Not only can experts process high-order information, they do so with great speed and low [[cognitive load|attentional load]]. Discovery and fluency effects work together so that as the discovery structures becomes more automatic, attentional resources are conserved for discovery of new relations and for high-level thinking and problem-solving.

===The role of attention===
[[William James]] (''Principles of Psychology'', 1890) asserted that "My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I notice shape my mind - without selective interest, experience is an utter chaos.".&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; His view was extreme, yet its gist was largely supported by subsequent [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] studies. Mere exposure does not seem to suffice for acquiring expertise.

Indeed, a relevant signal in a given [[behavioral]] condition may be considered noise in another. For example, when presented with two similar stimuli, one might endeavor to study the differences between their representations in order to improve one's ability to discriminate between them, or one may instead concentrate on the similarities to improve one's ability to identify both as belonging to the same category. A specific difference between them could be considered 'signal' in the first case and 'noise' in the second case. Thus, as we adapt to tasks and environments, we pay increasingly more attention to the perceptual features that are relevant and important for the task at hand, and at the same time, less attention to the irrelevant features. This mechanism is called attentional weighting.&lt;ref name ="Petrov" /&gt;

However, recent studies suggest that perceptual learning occurs without selective attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = T. | last2 = Nanez | first2 = J.E. | last3 = Sasaki | first3 = Y. | year = 2001 | title = Perceptual learning without perception | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6858| pages = 844–848 | doi=10.1038/35101601 | pmid=11677607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of such task-irrelevant perceptual learning (TIPL) show that the degree of TIPL is similar to that found through direct training procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 =  | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2009 | title = The Phenomenon of Task-Irrelevant Perceptual Learning | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 49 | issue = 21| pages = 2604–2610 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIPL for a stimulus depends on the relationship between that stimulus and important task events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 =  | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2003 | title = Is subliminal learning really passive? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6927| page = 36 | doi=10.1038/422036a | pmid=12621425}}&lt;/ref&gt; or upon stimulus reward contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 = Kim | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2009 | title = Rewards Evoke Learning of Unconsciously Processed Visual Stimuli in Adult Humans | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 700–7 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been suggested that learning (of task irrelevant stimuli) is contingent upon spatially diffusive learning signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 =  | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2005 | title = A unified model of task-irrelevant and task-relevant perceptual learning | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | pages = 329–334 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2005.05.010 | pmid = 15955722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects, but upon a shorter time scale, have been found for memory processes and  in some cases is called attentional boosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swallow|first1=KM|last2=Jiang|first2=YV|title=The Attentional Boost Effect: Transient increases in attention to one task enhance performance in a second task.|journal=Cognition|date=April 2010|volume=115|issue=1|pages=118–32|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2009.12.003|pmid=20080232|pmc=2830300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when an important (alerting) event occurs, learning may also affect concurrent, non-attended and non-salient stimuli.&lt;ref name="Jiang2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Y Jiang |author2=MM Chun |year=2001|title=Selective attention modulates implicit learning |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A |citeseerx = 10.1.1.24.8668 |doi=10.1080/713756001 |pmid=11765735 |volume=54 |pages=1105–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time course of perceptual learning===
The time course of perceptual [[learning]] varies from one participant to another.&lt;ref name="Wong, Peters, Goldreich" /&gt; Perceptual learning occurs not only within the first training session but also between sessions.&lt;ref name="Karni, A. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karni | first1 = A. | last2 = Sagi | first2 = D. | year = 1993 | title = The time course of learning a visual skill | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 365 | issue = 6443| pages = 250–252 | doi = 10.1038/365250a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fast learning (i.e., within-first-session learning) and slow learning (i.e., between-session learning) involves different changes in the human adult [[brain]]. While the fast learning effects can only be retained for a short term of several days, the slow [[learning]] effects can be preserved for a long term over several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qu | first1 = Z.

==Explanations and Models==

===Receptive field modification===
Research on basic [[Sense|sensory]] discriminations often show that perceptual [[learning]] effects are specific to the trained task or [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahle, M., Poggio, T. (2002) Perceptual learning. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers take this to suggest that perceptual learning may work by modifying the [[receptive field]]s of the cells (e.g., [[visual cortex|V1]] and V2 cells) that initially encode the stimulus. For example, individual cells could adapt to become more sensitive to important features, effectively recruiting more cells for a particular purpose, making some cells more specifically tuned for the task at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahle | first1 = M. | last2 = Edelman | first2 = S. | year = 1993 | title = Long-term learning in vernier acuity: Effects of stimulus orientation, range and of feedback | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 397–412 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(93)90094-d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for receptive field change has been found using single-cell recording techniques in [[primates]] in both tactile and auditory domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Recanzone | first1 = G.H. | last2 = Schreiner | first2 = C.E. | last3 = Merzenich | first3 = M.M. | year = 1993 | title = Plasticity in the frequency representation of primary auditory cortex following discrimination training in adult owl monkeys | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 87–103 | pmid = 8423485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all perceptual [[learning]] tasks are specific to the trained stimuli or tasks. Sireteanu and Rettenback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonards | first1 = U. | last2 = Rettenback | first2 = R. | last3 = Nase | first3 = G. | last4 = Sireteanu | first4 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Perceptual learning of highly demanding visual search tasks | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 42 | issue = 18| pages = 2193–204 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(02)00134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussed discrimination learning effects that generalize across eyes, retinal locations and tasks. Ahissar and Hochstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahissar | first1 = M. | last2 = Hochstein | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Learning pop-out detection: The spread of attention and learning in feature search: effects of target distribution and task difficulty | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1349–64 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(00)00002-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; used visual search to show that learning to detect a single line element hidden in an array of differently-oriented line segments could generalize to positions at which the target was never presented. In human vision, not enough receptive field modification has been found in early visual areas to explain perceptual learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoups | first1 = A. | last2 = Vogels | first2 = R. | last3 = Qian | first3 = N. | last4 = Orban | first4 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Practising orientation identification improves orientation coding in V1 neurons | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 412 | issue = 6846| pages = 549–53 | doi=10.1038/35087601 | pmid=11484056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training that produces large behavioral changes such as improvements in discrimination does not produce changes in receptive fields. In studies where changes have been found, the changes are too small to explain changes in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ghose | first1 = G.M. | last2 = Yang | first2 = T. | last3 = Maunsell | first3 = J.H. | year = 2002 | title = Physiological correlates of perceptual learning in monkey v1 and v2 | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 1867–88 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00690.2001 | pmid = 11929908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse hierarchy theory===
The Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT), proposed by Ahissar &amp; Hochstein, aims to link between learning dynamics and specificity and the underlying neuronal sites.&lt;ref name="RHT2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=M. Ahissar |author2=S. Hochstein |year=2004 |pages=457–64 |title=The reverse hierarchy theory of visual perceptual learning |volume=8|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.08.011 |pmid=15450510 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; RHT proposes that naïve performance is based on responses at high-level cortical areas, where crude, categorical level representations of the environment are represented. Hence initial learning stages involve understanding global aspects of the task. Subsequent practice may yield better perceptual resolution as a consequence of accessing lower-level information via the feedback connections going from high to low levels. Accessing the relevant low-level representations requires a backward search during which informative input populations of neurons in the low level are allocated. Hence, subsequent learning and its specificity reflect the resolution of lower levels. RHT thus proposes that initial performance is limited by the high-level resolution whereas post-training performance is limited by the resolution at low levels. Since high-level representations of different individuals differ due to their prior experience, their initial learning patterns may differ. Several imaging studies are in line with this interpretation, finding that initial performance is correlated with average (BOLD) responses at higher-level areas whereas subsequent performance is more correlated with activity at lower-level areas{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. RHT proposes that modifications at low levels will occur only when the backward search (from high to low levels of processing) is successful. Such success requires that the backward search will "know" which neurons in the lower level are informative. This "knowledge" is gained by training repeatedly on a limited set of stimuli, such that the same lower-level neuronal populations are informative during several trials. Recent studies found that mixing a broad range of stimuli may also yield effective learning if these stimuli are clearly perceived as different, or are explicitly tagged as different. These findings further support the requirement for top-down guidance in order to obtain effective learning.

===Enrichment versus differentiation===
In some complex perceptual tasks, all [[human]]s are experts. We are all very sophisticated, but not infallible at scene identification, face identification and speech [[perception]]. Traditional explanations attribute this expertise to some holistic, somewhat specialized, mechanisms. Perhaps such quick identifications are achieved by more specific and complex perceptual detectors which gradually "chunk" (i.e., unitize) features that tend to concur, making it easier to pull a whole set of information. Whether any concurrence of features can gradually be chunked with practice or chunking can only be obtained with some pre-disposition (e.g. faces, phonological categories) is an open question. Current findings suggest that such expertise is correlated with a significant increase in the cortical volume involved in these processes. Thus, we all have somewhat specialized face areas, which may reveal an innate property, but we also develop somewhat specialized areas for written words as opposed to single letters or strings of letter-like symbols. Moreover, special experts in a given domain have larger cortical areas involved in that domain. Thus, expert musicians have larger auditory areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Draganski | first1 = B | last2 = May | first2 = A | year = 2008 | title = Training-induced structural changes in the adult human brain | url = | journal = Behav Brain Res | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 137–142 | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.02.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations are in line with traditional theories of enrichment proposing that improved performance involves an increase in cortical representation. For this expertise, basic categorical identification may be based on enriched and detailed representations, located to some extent in specialized brain areas. [[Physiological]] evidence suggests that training for refined discrimination along basic dimensions (e.g. frequency in the auditory modality) also increases the representation of the trained parameters, though in these cases the increase may mainly involve lower-level sensory areas.&lt;ref name = "Gibson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gibson | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Gibson | first2 = E.J. | year = 1955 | title = Perceptual learning: Differentiation or enrichment? | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 32–41 | doi=10.1037/h0048826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective reweighting===
In 2005, Petrov, Dosher and Lu pointed out that perceptual [[learning]] may be explained in terms of the selection of which analyzers best perform the classification, even in simple discrimination tasks. They explain that the some part of the neural system responsible for particular decisions have specificity, while low-level perceptual units do not.&lt;ref name ="Petrov" /&gt; In their model, encodings at the lowest level do not change. Rather, changes that occur in perceptual learning arise from changes in higher-level, abstract representations of the relevant stimuli. Because specificity can come from differentially selecting information, this "selective reweighting theory" allows for learning of complex, abstract representation. This corresponds to Gibson's earlier account of perceptual learning as selection and [[learning]] of distinguishing features. Selection may be the unifying principles of perceptual learning at all levels.&lt;ref name ="KellmanGarrigan2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellman | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Garrigan | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Perceptual learning and human expertise | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 53–84 | doi =  10.1016/j.plrev.2008.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The impact of training protocol and the dynamics of learning==
[[Ivan Pavlov]] discovered [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. He found that when a stimulus (e.g. sound) is immediately followed by food several times, the mere presentation of this stimulus would subsequently elicit saliva in a dog's mouth. He further found that when he used a differential protocol, by consistently presenting food after one stimulus while not presenting food after another stimulus, dogs were quickly conditioned to selectively salivate in response to the rewarded one. He then asked whether this protocol could be used to increase perceptual discrimination, by differentially rewarding two very similar stimuli (e.g. tones with similar frequency). However, he found that differential conditioning was not effective.

Pavlov's studies were followed by many training studies which found that an effective way to increase perceptual resolution is to begin with a large difference along the required dimension and gradually proceed to small differences along this dimension. This easy-to-difficult transfer was termed "transfer along a continuum".

These studies showed that the dynamics of learning depend on the training protocol, rather than on the total amount of practice. Moreover, it seems that the strategy implicitly chosen for learning is highly sensitive to the choice of the first few trials during which the system tries to identify the relevant cues.

===Consolidation and sleep===
Several studies asked whether [[learning]] takes place during practice sessions or in between, for example, during subsequent sleep. The dynamics of [[learning]] are hard to evaluate since the directly measured parameter is performance, which is affected by both [[learning]], inducing improvement, and fatigue, which hampers performance. Current studies suggest that sleep contributes to improved and durable [[learning]] effects, by further strengthening connections in the absence of continued practice.&lt;ref name="Karni, A. 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stickgold | first1 = R. | last2 = LaTanya | first2 = J. | last3 = Hobson | first3 = J.A. | year = 2000 | title = Visual discrimination learning requires sleep after training | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 12| pages = 1237–1238 | doi = 10.1038/81756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Shiu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiu | first1 = L. | last2 = Pashler | first2 = H. | year = 1992 | title = Improvement in line orientation discrimination is retinally local but dependent on cognitive set | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 582–588 | doi=10.3758/bf03206720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[slow-wave sleep|slow-wave]] and [[REM sleep|REM]] (rapid eye movement) stages of sleep may contribute to this process, via not-yet-understood mechanisms.

===Comparison and contrast===
Practice with comparison and contrast of instances that belong to the same or different categories allow for the pick-up of the distinguishing features—features that are important for the classification task—and the filter of the irrelevant features.&lt;ref name="GibsonEleanor"&gt;Gibson, Eleanor (1969) Principles of Perceptual Learning and Development. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task difficulty===
[[Learning]] easy examples first may lead to better transfer and better [[learning]] of more difficult cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahissar | first1 = M. | last2 = Hochstein | first2 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Task difficulty and [[learning]] specificity | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 387 | issue = | pages = 401–406 | doi = 10.1038/387401a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By recording ERPs from human adults, Ding and Colleagues investigated the influence of task difficulty on the brain mechanisms of visual perceptual learning. Results showed that difficult task training affected earlier visual processing stage and broader visual cortical regions than easy task training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Song | first2 = Y. | last3 = Qu | first3 = Z. | last4 = Ding | first4 = Y.L. | year = 2010 | title = Task difficulty modulates electrophysiological correlates of perceptual learning | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 234–240 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2009.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active classification and attention===
Active classification effort and attention are often necessary to produce perceptual learning effects.&lt;ref name="Shiu"/&gt; However, in some cases, mere exposure to certain stimulus variations can produce improved discriminations.

===Feedback===
In many cases, perceptual learning does not require feedback (whether or not the classification is correct).&lt;ref name = "Gibson" /&gt; Other studies suggest that block feedback (feedback only after a block of trials) produces more learning effects than no feedback at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herzog | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Fahle | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Modeling perceptual learning: Difficulties and how they can be overcome | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 107–117 | doi = 10.1007/s004220050418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Despite the marked perceptual learning demonstrated in different sensory systems and under varied training paradigms, it is clear that perceptual learning must face certain unsurpassable limits imposed by the physical characteristics of the sensory system. For instance, in tactile spatial acuity tasks, experiments suggest that the extent of learning is limited by fingertip surface area, which may constrain the underlying density of [[mechanoreceptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Wong, Peters, Goldreich" /&gt;

==Relations to other forms of learning==

===Declarative &amp; procedural learning===
In many domains of expertise in the real world, perceptual learning interacts with other forms of learning. [[Declarative learning|Declarative knowledge]] tends to occur with perceptual learning. As we learn to distinguish between an array of wine flavors, we also develop a wide range of vocabularies to describe the intricacy of each flavor.

Similarly, perceptual learning also interacts flexibly with [[procedural knowledge]]. For example, the perceptual expertise of a baseball player at bat can detect early in the ball's flight whether the pitcher threw a curveball. However, the perceptual differentiation of the feel of swinging the bat in various ways may also have been involved in learning the motor commands that produce the required swing.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002"/&gt;

===Implicit learning===
Perceptual [[learning]] is often said to be [[implicit learning|implicit]], such that [[learning]] occurs without awareness. It is not at all clear whether perceptual [[learning]] is always implicit. Changes in sensitivity that arise are often not conscious and do not involve conscious procedures, but perceptual information can be mapped onto various responses.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002" /&gt;

In complex perceptual learning tasks (e.g., sorting of newborn chicks by sex, playing chess), experts are often unable to explain what stimulus relationships they are using in classification. However, in less complex perceptual [[learning]] tasks, people can point out what information they're using to make classifications.

==Applications==

===Improving perceptual skills===
An important potential application of perceptual [[learning]] is the acquisition of skill for practical purposes. Thus it is important to understand whether training for increased resolution in lab conditions induces a general upgrade which transfers to other environmental contexts, or results from mechanisms which are context specific. Improving complex skills is typically gained by training under complex simulation conditions rather than one component at a time. Recent lab-based training protocols with complex action computer games have shown that such practice indeed modifies [[visual]] skills in a general way, which transfers to new visual contexts. In 2010, Achtman, Green, and Bavelier reviewed the research on video games to train visual skills.&lt;ref name="RHT2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=R.L. Achtman |author2=C.S. Green |author3=D. Bavelier  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |pages=4–5 |title=Video games as a tool to train visual skills |volume=26|journal=Restor Neurol Neuroscience |pmc=2884279 |pmid=18997318}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite a previous review by Green &amp; Bavelier (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Green, C.S., &amp; Bavelier, D.. (2006) The Cognitive Neuroscience of Video Games. In: Messaris P, Humphrey L, editors. Digital Media: Transformations in Human Communication. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; on using video games to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities. A variety of skills were upgraded in video game players, including "improved hand-eye coordination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffith | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Voloschin | first2 = P. | last3 = Gibb | first3 = G.D. | last4 = Bailey | first4 = J.R. | year = 1983 | title = Differences in eye-hand motor coordination of video-game users and non-users | url = | journal = Percept Mot Skills | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 155–158 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1983.57.1.155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased processing in the periphery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = C.S. | last2 = Bavelier | first2 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Effect of action video games on the spatial distribution of visuospatial attention | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 1465–1478 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.32.6.1465 | pmid=17154785 | pmc=2896828}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhanced mental rotation skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = V.K. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = R.E. | year = 2000 | title = Domain specificity of spatial expertise: The case of video game players | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 97–115 | doi = 10.1002/acp.759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; greater divided attention abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenfield | first1 = P.M. | last2 = DeWinstanley | first2 = P. | last3 = Kilpatrick | first3 = H. | last4 = Kaye | first4 = D. | year = 1994 | title = Action video games and informal education: effects on strategies for dividing visual attention | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Devevelopmental Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 105–123 | doi = 10.1016/0193-3973(94)90008-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and faster reaction times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castel | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Pratt | first2 = J. | last3 = Drummond | first3 = E. | year = 2005 | title = The effects of action video game experience on the time course of inhibition of return and the efficiency of visual search | url = | journal = Ada Psychol (Amst) | volume = 119 | issue = 2| pages = 217–230 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2005.02.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few". An important characteristic is the functional increase in the size of the effective visual field (within which viewers can identify objects), which is trained in action games and transfers to new settings. Whether learning of simple discriminations, which are trained in separation, transfers to new stimulus contexts (e.g. complex stimulus conditions) is still an open question.

Like experimental procedures, other attempts to apply perceptual [[learning]] methods to basic and complex skills use training situations in which the learner receives many short classification trials. Tallal, Merzenich and their colleagues have successfully adapted auditory discrimination paradigms to address speech and language difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merzenich | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = W.M. | last3 = Johnstone | first3 = P. | last4 = Schreiner | first4 = C. | last5 = Miller | first5 = S. | last6 = Tallal | first6 = P. | year = 1996 | title = Temporal processing deficits of language impaired children ameliorated by training | url = | journal = Science | volume = 271 | issue = 5245| pages = 77–81 | doi = 10.1126/science.271.5245.77 | pmid=8539603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tallal | first1 = P. | last2 = Merzenich | first2 = M. | last3 = Miller | first3 = S. | last4 = Jenkins | first4 = W. | year = 1998 | title = Language learning impairment: Integrating research and remediation | url = | journal = [[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 197–199 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9450.393079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They reported improvements in language learning-impaired children using specially enhanced and extended speech signals. The results applied not only to auditory discrimination performance but speech and language comprehension as well.

===Technologies for perceptual learning===
In educational domains, recent efforts by [[Philip Kellman]] and colleagues showed that perceptual learning can be systematically produced and accelerated using specific, computer-based technology. Their approach to perceptual learning methods take the form of perceptual learning modules (PLMs): sets of short, interactive trials that develop, in a particular domain, learners' pattern recognition, classification abilities, and their abilities to map across multiple representations. As a result of practice with mapping across transformations (e.g., algebra, fractions) and across multiple representations (e.g., graphs, equations, and word problems), students show dramatic gains in their structure recognition in fraction learning and algebra. They also demonstrated that when students practice classifying algebraic transformations using PLMs, the results show remarkable improvements in fluency at algebra problem solving.&lt;ref name="KellmanGarrigan2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellman | first1 = P.

'''Peripeteia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛr|ə|p|ᵻ|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə}} ({{lang-el|περιπέτεια}}) is a reversal of circumstances, or turning point. The term is primarily used with reference to works of literature. The Anglicized form of ''peripeteia'' is '''peripety'''.

==Aristotle's view==
[[Aristotle]], in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]], defines peripeteia as "a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity." According to [[Aristotle]], peripeteia, along with discovery, is the most effective when it comes to [[drama]], particularly in a [[tragedy]]. He wrote that "The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeteia, like that which goes with the Discovery in [[Oedipus]]...".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Poetics]], 1452a&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle says that peripeteia is the most powerful part of a plot in a tragedy along with discovery. A peripety is the change of the kind described from one state of things within the play to its opposite, and that too in the way we are saying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events. There is often no element like Peripeteia; it can bring forth or result in terror, mercy, or in comedies it can bring a smile or it can bring forth tears (Rizo). This is the best way to spark and maintain attention throughout the various form and genres of drama "Tragedy imitates good actions and, thereby, measures and depicts the well-being of its protagonist. But in his formal definition, as well as throughout the Poetics, Aristotle emphasizes that" ... Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of events inspiring fear or pity" (1452a 1); in fact, at one point [[Aristotle]] isolates the imitation of "actions that excite pity and fear" as "the distinctive mark of tragic imitation" (1452b 30). Pity and fear are effected through reversal and recognition; and these "most powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy-Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and recognition scenes-are parts of the plot (1450a 32). has the shift of the tragic protagonist's fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy. It is often an ironic twist. Good uses of Peripeteia are those that especially are parts of a complex plot, so that they are defined by their changes of fortune being accompanied by reversal, recognition, or both" (Smithson).

Peripeteia includes [[character arc|changes of character]], but also more external changes.  A character who becomes rich and famous from poverty and obscurity has undergone peripeteia, even if his character remains the same.

When a character learns something he had been previously ignorant of, this is normally distinguished from peripeteia as [[anagnorisis]] or discovery, a distinction derived from Aristotle's work.

Aristotle considered anagnorisis, leading to peripeteia, the mark of a superior tragedy.  Two such plays are ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', where the oracle's information that Oedipus had killed [[Laius|his father]] and married [[Jocasta|his mother]] brought about his mother's death and his own blindness and exile, and ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', where Iphigenia realizes that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, resulting in all three of them escaping Tauris. These plots he considered complex and superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so. Aristotle identified ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' as the principal work demonstrating peripety.  (See Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.)

==Examples==

===''Oedipus Rex''===
In Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the peripeteia occurs towards the end of the play when the Messenger brings Oedipus news of his parentage.  In the play, Oedipus is fated to murder his father and marry his mother.  His parents, Laius and Jocasta, try to forestall the oracle by sending their son away to be killed, but he is actually raised by Polybus and his wife, Merope, the rulers of another kingdom.  The irony of the Messenger’s information is that it was supposed to comfort Oedipus and assure him that he was the son of Polybus. Unfortunately for Oedipus, the Messenger says, "Polybus was nothing to you, [Oedipus] that’s why, not in blood" (Sophocles 1113).  The Messenger received Oedipus from one of Laius’ servants and then gave him to Polybus.  The plot comes together when Oedipus realizes that he is the son and murderer of Laius as well as the son and husband of Jocasta.  Martin M. Winkler says that here, peripeteia and [[Anagnorisis|anagnôrisis]] occur at the same time "for the greatest possible impact" because Oedipus has been "struck a blow from above, as if by fate or the gods. He is changing from the mighty and somewhat arrogant king of Thebes to a figure of woe" (Winkler 57).

===Conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus===
{{main|Conversion of Paul}}
The instantaneous conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus is a classic example of ''peripeteia'', which [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] presented in his ''Life of Constantine'' as a pattern for the equally revelatory conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Modern biographers of Constantine see his conversion less as a momentary phenomenon than as a step in a lifelong process.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'' 2010: the ''trope'' of peripaty is discussed in "Constantine's Conversion", pp168f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Three Apples===
In "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', after the murderer reveals himself near the middle of the story, he explains his reasons behind the murder in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which begins with him going on a journey to find three rare apples for his wife, but after returning finds out she cannot eat them due to her lingering illness. Later at work, he sees a slave passing by with one of those apples claiming that he received it from his girlfriend, a married woman with three such apples her husband gave her. He returns home and demands his wife to show him all three apples, but she only shows him two. This convinces him of her [[infidelity]] and he murders her as a result. After he disposes of her body, he returns home where his son confesses that he had stolen one of the apples and that a slave, to whom he had told about his father's journey, had fled with it. The murderer thus realizes his guilt and regrets what he has just done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of peripety occurs near the end. After finding out about the culprit behind the murder, the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the [[tricky slave]] within three days, or else he will have Ja'far executed instead. After the deadline has passed, Ja'far prepares to be executed for his failure and bids his family farewell. As he hugs his youngest daughter, he feels a round object in her pocket, which is revealed to be the same apple that the culprit was holding. In the story's twist ending, the daughter reveals that she obtained it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case, preventing his own execution.

[[File:Antoninus Pius Coin pieta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Pietas'', as a virtue of the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], represented by a woman offering a sacrifice on the reverse of this [[sestertius]]]]

'''''Pietas''''', translated variously as "duty", "religiosity"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Williams, "Religion and Roman Coins," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; or "religious behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; "loyalty",&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bernstein, "Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; "devotion", or "[[filial piety]]" (English "piety" derives from the Latin), was one of the chief [[virtue]]s among the [[ancient Roman]]s. It was the distinguishing virtue of the [[Founding of Rome|founding]] hero [[Aeneas]], who is often given the [[adjective|adjectival]] epithet ''pius'' ("religious") throughout [[Virgil]]'s epic ''[[Aeneid]]''. The sacred nature of ''pietas'' was embodied by the divine personification Pietas, a goddess often pictured on Roman coins. The Greek equivalent is ''[[eusebeia]]'' (εὐσέβεια).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), pp. 864–865.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] defined ''pietas'' as the virtue "which admonishes us to do our duty to our country or our parents or other blood relations."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De inventione'' 2.22.66 ''(pietatem,  quae erga patriam aut parentes aut alios sanguine coniunctos officium conservare moneat)'', as quoted by [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The man who possessed ''pietas'' "performed all his duties towards the deity and his fellow human beings fully and in every respect," as the 19th-century classical scholar [[Georg Wissowa]] described it.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Wagenvort, ''Pietas,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As virtue==
''Pietas erga parentes'' ("''pietas'' toward one's parents") was one of the most important aspects of demonstrating virtue. ''Pius'' as a ''[[cognomen]]'' originated as way to mark a person as especially "pious" in this sense: announcing one's personal ''pietas'' through official nomenclature seems to have been an innovation of the [[Roman Republic|late Republic]], when [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] claimed it for his efforts to have his father, [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Numidicus]], recalled from exile.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pietas'' extended also toward "parents" in the sense of "ancestors," and was one of the basic principles of [[mos maiorum|Roman tradition]], as expressed by the care of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Heid, "The Romanness of Roman Christianity," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pietas'' as a virtue resided within a person, in contrast to a virtue or gift such as ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]],'' which was given by the gods. ''Pietas,'' however, allowed a person to recognize the divine source of benefits conferred.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of ''pietas'' in English occurs in Anselm Bayly’s ''The Alliance of Music, Poetry, and Oratory'', published in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford English Dictionary Online. Web. 28 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Herennia1.1.jpg|thumb|250px|Denarius of Herennius, depicting Pietas and an act of ''pietas''.]]
Pietas was represented on coin by cult objects, but also as a woman conducting a sacrifice by means of fire at an altar.&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In the imagery of sacrifice, [[libation]] was the fundamental act that came to symbolize ''pietas''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pietas'' is first represented on Roman coins on ''[[denarius|denarii]]'' issued by [[Marcus Herennius]] in 108 or 107 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; Pietas appears on the obverse as a divine [[personification]], in [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] form; the quality of ''pietas'' is represented by a son carrying his father on his back; the symbolism of which would be echoed in [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], with [[Aeneas]] carrying his father [[Anchises]] out of the burning [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; Pietas is among the virtues that appear frequently on Imperial coins, including those issued under [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the symbols of ''pietas'' was the stork, described by [[Petronius]] as ''pietaticultrix'', "cultivator of ''pietas''." The stork represented filial piety in particular, as the Romans believed that it demonstrated family loyalty by returning to the same nest every year, and that it took care of its parents in old age. As such, a stork appears next to Pietas on  [[:File:Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius.jpg|a coin issued by Metellus Pius]] (on whose ''cognomen'' see [[#As virtue|above]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 10.63; Anna Clark, ''Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 154–155; Catherine Connors, ''Petronius the Poet'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As goddess==
[[Image:Bronze-Flavia Maximiana Theodora-trier RIC 65.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Flavia Maximiana Theodora]] on the obverse, on the reverse Pietas holding infant to her breast.]]
Pietas was the divine presence in everyday life that cautioned humans not to intrude on the realm of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;As expressed by Cicero, ''[[De Legibus]]'' 2.22; Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Violations of ''pietas'' required a ''[[piaculum]]'', expiatory rites.&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple to Pietas was vowed ''([[votum]])'' by [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]] at the [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Battle of Thermopylae in 191 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 40.34.4; Fears, "The Theology of Victory at Rome," pp. 741–742, and "The Cult of Virtues," p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a miraculous legend ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#miraculum|miraculum]]),''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 7.121; [[Valerius Maximus]] 5.4.7, as cited by Fears, "The Theology of Victory," p. 742, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt; a poor woman who was starving in prison was saved when her daughter gave her breast milk (compare [[Roman Charity]]). Caught in the act, the daughter was not punished, but recognized for her ''pietas''. Mother and daughter were set free, and given public support for the rest of their lives. The site was regarded as sacred to the goddess Pietas ''(consecratus deae)'' because she had chosen to manifest her presence there.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Theology of Victory," p. 742; "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; The story exemplified ''pietas erga parentes'', the proper devotion one ought to show to one's parents.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial women portrayed as Pietas===
Pietas was often depicted as goddess on the reverse of Roman Imperial coins, with women of the imperial family on the obverse,&lt;ref&gt;Roman Coins Issued During the Reign of Emperor Hadrian, [http://www.dig4coins.com/articles/ancient-coins/roman-coins-issued-during-the-reign-of-emperor-hadrian-ad-117-to-138 Dig4Coins.com].&lt;/ref&gt; as an appropriate virtue to be attributed to them. Women of the Imperial family might be portrayed in art in the goddess's guise.

The '''principle of maximum caliber''' ('''MaxCal''') or '''maximum path entropy principle''', suggested by [[E. T. Jaynes]],&lt;ref name="Jaynes1980" /&gt; can be considered as a generalization of the [[principle of maximum entropy]]. It postulates that the most unbiased probability distribution of paths is the one that maximizes their [[Shannon entropy]]. This entropy of paths is sometimes called the "caliber" of the system, and is given by the path integral

: &lt;math&gt; S[\rho[x()]] = \int D_x \,\, \rho[x()]  \, \ln {\rho[x()] \over \pi[x()]}&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==

The principle of maximum caliber was proposed by [[Edwin T. Jaynes]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="Jaynes1980" /&gt; in an article titled 
''The Minimum Entropy Production Principle'' over the context of to find a principle for to derive the [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics]].

== Mathematical formulation ==

The principle of maximum caliber can be considered as a generalization of the [[principle of maximum entropy]] defined over the paths space, the caliber &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is of the form

: &lt;math&gt; S[\rho[x()]] = \int D_x \rho[x()] \ln {\rho[x()] \over \pi[x()]}&lt;/math&gt;

where for ''n''-constraints

: &lt;math&gt; \int D_x \rho[x()] A_n[x()] = \langle A_n[x()] \rangle = a_n &lt;/math&gt;

it is shown that the probability functional is

: &lt;math&gt; \rho[x()] = \exp\left\{ - \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_n A_n[x()] \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the same way, for n dynamical constraints defined in the interval &lt;math&gt; t \in [0,T] &lt;/math&gt; of the form

: &lt;math&gt; \int D_x \rho[x()] L_n(x(t),\dot x(t), t ) = \langle L_n(x(t),\dot x(t),t ) \rangle = \ell(t)&lt;/math&gt;

it is shown that the probability functional is

: &lt;math&gt; \rho[x()] = \exp\left\{ - \sum_{i=0}^n \int_0^T dt \, \alpha_n(t) L_n(x(t),\dot x(t), t ) \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Maximum caliber and statistical mechanics==

Following the hypothesis of Jaynes, there are publications in which it appears as the principle of maximum caliber it is framed in the context of creating a statistical representation of systems with many degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="Presse2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazoglou2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2015" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">The '''recognition failure of recallable words''' is an experimental phenomenon in [[cognitive psychology]] originally discovered by the memory researcher [[Endel Tulving]] and colleagues. Although recognition of previously-studied words through a [[recognition memory]] test, in which the words are re-presented for a memory judgment, generally yields a greater response probability than the recall of previously studied words through a [[recall test]], in which the words must be mentally retrieved from memory, Tulving found that this typical result could be reversed by manipulating the retrieval cues provided at test.

Tulving's procedure first tested the [[recognition memory]] of participants for a list of [[Memory#Memory tasks|paired associates]] using an [[Recognition_memory#Measurement_and_methods|item recognition]] procedure, to which participants responded "yes" if the pair of items was valid and "no" if the pair was invalid. Next, the participants were given a [[recall test]], in which they were shown one item in each pair and attempted to recall from memory the matching item. Tulving discovered that some items which participants had failed to recognize during the item recognition trials were recalled successfully during the subsequent recall test.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., &amp; Wiseman, S. (1975). Relation between recognition and recognition failure of recallable words. Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 92, 257-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of this effect, many people will fail to recognize the name "James Fenimore Cooper" if "Cooper" is presented as the cue, yet they will easily recall the author's surname if given the appropriate retrieval cue, "What is the author with first name James Fenimore?"&lt;ref&gt;Muter, P. (1978). Recognition failure of recallable words in semantic memory. Memory &amp; Cognition, 6(1), 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this example of recognition failure of recallable words occurs in [[semantic memory]], Tulving has also demonstrated this phenomenon in [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. (1972). Episodic and semantic memory. In E. Tulving and W. Donaldson (Eds.), Organization of Memory (pp. 381-402). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tulving and Wiseman also examined the association between recognition and cued recall for individual list items. The resulting Tulving-Wiseman function describes the correlation between the probability of recalling an item and the probability of recognizing the item [[conditional probability|conditional]] on recall having been successful.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. &amp; Flexser, A.J. (1992). On the Nature of the Tulving-Wiseman Function. Psychological Review, 99(3), 543-546.&lt;/ref&gt; The function predicts a moderate correlation between recognition and cued recall, suggesting a need to distinguish between retrieval based on the familiarity of an item's specific properties and retrieval based on the recollection of relational information between two items.&lt;ref&gt;Yonelinas, A.P. (1997). Recognition memory ROCs for item and associative information: The contribution of recollection and familiarity. Memory &amp; Cognition, 25(6), 747-763.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. (1980) Recognizing: The judgment of previous occurrence. Psychological Review, 87,252-271.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some contradictory evidence that bases recognition failure on retrieval failure.&lt;ref&gt; Rabinowtz, J.C., Mandler, G., and Barsalou, L.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48269">In [[computer science]], a '''rough set''', first described by [[Poles|Polish]] computer scientist [[Zdzislaw Pawlak|Zdzisław I. Pawlak]], is a formal approximation of a [[crisp set]] (i.e., conventional set) in terms of a pair of sets which give the ''lower'' and the ''upper'' approximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory (Pawlak 1991), the lower- and upper-approximation sets are crisp sets, but in other variations, the approximating sets may be [[fuzzy sets]].

==Definitions==
The following section contains an overview of the basic framework of rough set theory, as originally proposed by [[Zdzislaw Pawlak|Zdzisław I. Pawlak]], along with some of the key definitions. More formal properties and boundaries of rough sets can be found in Pawlak (1991) and cited references. The initial and basic theory of rough sets is sometimes referred to as ''"Pawlak Rough Sets"'' or ''"classical rough sets"'', as a means to distinguish from more recent extensions and generalizations.

Let &lt;math&gt;I = (\mathbb{U},\mathbb{A})&lt;/math&gt; be an information system ([[attribute-value system]]), where &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty, finite set of objects (the universe) and &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty, finite set of attributes such that &lt;math&gt;a:\mathbb{U} \rightarrow V_a&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values that attribute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may take. The information table assigns a value &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; to each attribute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the universe &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

With any &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; there is an associated [[equivalence relation]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{IND}(P) = \left\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{U}^2 \mid \forall a \in P, a(x)=a(y)\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; is called a &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-indiscernibility relation''. The partition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of all equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted  by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in \mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are ''indiscernible'' (or indistinguishable) by attributes from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; .

The equivalence classes of the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-indiscernibility relation are denoted &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example: equivalence-class structure===
For example, consider the following information table:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

When the full set of attributes &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from each other based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes. The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects.

It is apparent that different attribute subset selections will in general lead to different indiscernibility classes. For example, if attribute &lt;math&gt;P =\{ P_{1}\}&lt;/math&gt; alone is selected, we obtain the following, much coarser, equivalence-class structure:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Definition of a ''rough set''===
Let &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; be a target set that we wish to represent using attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; that is, we are told that an arbitrary set of objects &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; comprises a single class, and we wish to express this class (i.e., this subset) using the equivalence classes induced by attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. In general, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed exactly, because the set may include and exclude objects which are indistinguishable on the basis of attributes &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, consider the target set &lt;math&gt;X = \{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}, P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the full available set of features.  It will be noted that the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed exactly, because in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P,&lt;/math&gt;, objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3}, O_{7}, O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; are indiscernible. Thus, there is no way to represent any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which ''includes'' &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; but ''excludes'' objects &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be ''approximated'' using only the information contained within &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by constructing the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-lower and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-upper approximations of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\underline P}X= \{x \mid [x]_P \subseteq X\}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\overline P}X = \{x \mid [x]_P \cap X \neq \emptyset \}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Lower approximation and positive region====
The &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-lower approximation'', or ''positive region'', is the union of all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which are contained by (i.e., are subsets of) the target set – in the example, &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \{O_{1}, O_{2}\} \cup \{O_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of the two equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which are contained in the target set. The lower approximation is the complete set of objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt; that can be ''positively'' (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

====Upper approximation and negative region====
The &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-upper approximation'' is the union of all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which have non-empty intersection with the target set – in the example, &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \{O_{1}, O_{2}\} \cup \{O_{4}\} \cup \{O_{3}, O_{7}, O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of the three equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; that have non-empty intersection with the target set. The upper approximation is the complete set of objects that in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt; that ''cannot'' be positively (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to the ''complement'' (&lt;math&gt;\overline X&lt;/math&gt;) of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the upper approximation is the complete set of objects that are ''possibly'' members of the  target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}-{\overline P}X&lt;/math&gt; therefore represents the ''negative region'', containing the set of objects that can be definitely ruled out as members of the target set.

====Boundary region====
The ''boundary region'', given by set difference &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X - {\underline P}X&lt;/math&gt;, consists of those objects that can neither be ruled in nor ruled out as members of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

In summary, the lower approximation of a target set is a ''conservative'' approximation consisting of only those objects which can positively be identified as members of the set. (These objects have no indiscernible "clones" which are excluded by the target set.) The upper approximation is a ''liberal'' approximation which includes all objects that might be members of target set. (Some objects in the upper approximation may not be members of the target set.) From the perspective of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt;, the lower approximation contains objects that are members of the target set with certainty (probability = 1), while the upper approximation contains objects that are members of the target set with non-zero probability (probability &gt; 0).

====The rough set====
The tuple &lt;math&gt;\langle{\underline P}X,{\overline P}X\rangle&lt;/math&gt; composed of the lower and upper approximation is called a ''rough set''; thus, a rough set is composed of two crisp sets, one representing a ''lower boundary'' of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the other representing an ''upper boundary'' of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''accuracy'' of the rough-set representation of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be given (Pawlak 1991) by the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{P}(X) = \frac{\left | {\underline P}X \right |} {\left | {\overline P}X \right |} 
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the accuracy of the rough set representation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \alpha_{P}(X) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, is the ratio of the number of objects which can ''positively'' be placed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the number of objects that can ''possibly'' be placed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; – this provides a measure of how closely the rough set is approximating the target set. Clearly, when the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., boundary region empty), then &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{P}(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and the approximation is perfect; at the other extreme, whenever the lower approximation is empty, the accuracy is zero (regardless of the size of the upper approximation).

====Objective analysis====
Rough set theory is one of many methods that can be employed to analyse uncertain (including vague) systems, although less common than more traditional methods of [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[Dempster–Shafer theory]]. However a key difference, and a unique strength, of using classical rough set theory is that it provides an objective form of analysis (Pawlak et al. 1995). Unlike other methods, as those given above, classical rough set analysis requires no additional information, external parameters, models, functions, grades or subjective interpretations to determine set membership – instead it only uses the information presented within the given data (Düntsch and Gediga 1995).  More recent adaptations of rough set theory, such as dominance-based, decision-theoretic and fuzzy rough sets, have introduced more subjectivity to the analysis.

===Definability===
In general, the upper and lower approximations are not equal; in such cases, we say that target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''undefinable'' or ''roughly definable'' on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. When the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., the boundary is empty),  &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = {\underline P}X&lt;/math&gt;, then the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''definable'' on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. We can distinguish the following special cases of undefinability:

* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''internally'' ''undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X \neq \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''no'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but there ''are'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''externally undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there ''are'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but there are ''no'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''totally undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''no'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and there are ''no'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, we cannot decide whether any object is, or is not, a member of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Reduct and core===
An interesting question is whether there are attributes in the information system (attribute-value table) which are more important to the knowledge represented in the equivalence class structure than other attributes.  Often, we wonder whether there is a subset of attributes which can, by itself, fully characterize the knowledge in the database; such an attribute set is called a ''reduct''.

Formally, a reduct is a subset of attributes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED} \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; such that

* &lt;math&gt;[x]_{\mathrm{RED}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the equivalence classes induced by the reduced attribute set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; are the same as the equivalence class structure induced by the full attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* the attribute set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; is ''minimal'', in the sense that &lt;math&gt;[x]_{(\mathrm{RED}-\{a\})} \neq [x]_P&lt;/math&gt; for any attribute &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, no attribute can be removed from set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; without changing the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

A reduct can be thought of as a ''sufficient'' set of features – sufficient, that is, to represent the category structure. In the example table above, attribute set &lt;math&gt;\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is a reduct – the information system projected on just these attributes possesses the same equivalence class structure as that expressed by the full attribute set:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Attribute set &lt;math&gt;\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is a reduct because eliminating any of these attributes causes a collapse of the equivalence-class structure, with the result that &lt;math&gt;[x]_{\mathrm{RED}} \neq [x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

The reduct of an information system is ''not unique'': there may be many subsets of attributes which preserve the equivalence-class structure (i.e., the knowledge) expressed in the information system.  In the example information system above, another reduct is &lt;math&gt;\{P_1,P_2,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;, producing the same equivalence-class structure as &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of attributes which is common to all reducts is called the ''core'': the core is the set of attributes which is possessed by ''every'' reduct, and therefore consists of attributes which cannot be removed from the information system without causing collapse of the equivalence-class structure.  The core may be thought of as the set of ''necessary'' attributes – necessary, that is, for the category structure to be represented. In the example, the only such attribute is &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;; any one of the other attributes can be removed singly without damaging the equivalence-class structure, and hence these are all ''dispensable''.  However, removing &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; by itself ''does'' change the equivalence-class structure, and thus &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''indispensable'' attribute of this information system, and hence the core.

It is possible for the core to be empty, which means that there is no indispensable attribute: any single attribute in such an information system can be deleted without altering the equivalence-class  structure. In such cases, there is no ''essential'' or necessary attribute which is required for the class structure to be represented.

===Attribute dependency===
One of the most important aspects of database analysis or data acquisition is the discovery of attribute dependencies; that is, we wish to discover which variables are strongly related to which other variables. Generally, it is these strong relationships that will warrant further investigation, and that will ultimately be of use in predictive modeling.

In rough set theory, the notion of dependency is defined very simply. Let us take two (disjoint) sets of attributes, set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and inquire what degree of dependency obtains between them.  Each attribute set induces an (indiscernibility) equivalence class structure, the equivalence classes induced by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;, and the equivalence classes induced by &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \dots, Q_N \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is a given equivalence class from the equivalence-class structure induced by attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, the ''dependency'' of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{P}(Q) =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left | {\underline P}Q_i \right |} {\left | \mathbb{U} \right |} \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for each equivalence class &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, we add up the size of its lower approximation by the attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  This approximation (as above, for arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is the number of objects which on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be positively identified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Added across all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator above represents the total number of objects which – based on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; – can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by attributes &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects.  The dependency &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to determine the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;".

Another, intuitive, way to consider dependency is to take the partition induced by Q as the target class C, and consider P as the attribute set we wish to use in order to "re-construct" the target class C. If P can completely reconstruct C, then Q depends totally upon P; if P results in a poor and perhaps a random reconstruction of C, then Q does not depend upon P at all.

Thus, this measure of dependency expresses the degree of ''functional'' (i.e., deterministic) dependency of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; it is ''not'' symmetric.  The relationship of this notion of attribute dependency to more traditional information-theoretic (i.e., entropic) notions of attribute dependence has been discussed in a number of sources (e.g., Pawlak, Wong, &amp; Ziarko 1988; Yao &amp; Yao 2002; Wong, Ziarko, &amp; Ye 1986, Quafafou &amp; Boussouf 2000).

==Rule extraction==
The category representations discussed above are all ''extensional'' in nature; that is, a category or complex class is simply the sum of all its members. To represent a category is, then, just to be able to list or identify all the objects belonging to that category.  However, extensional category representations have very limited practical use, because they provide no insight for deciding whether novel (never-before-seen) objects are members of the category.

What is generally desired is an ''intentional'' description of the category, a representation of the category based on a set of ''rules'' that describe the scope of the category.  The choice of such rules is not unique, and therein lies the issue of [[inductive bias]]. See [[Version space]] and [[Model selection]] for more about this issue.

There are a few rule-extraction methods.  We will start from a rule-extraction procedure based on Ziarko &amp; Shan (1995).

===Decision matrices===

Let us say that we wish to find the minimal set of consistent rules ([[logical implication]]s) that characterize our sample system.  For a set of ''condition'' attributes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P} = \{P_1, P_2, P_3, \dots , P_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and a decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q, Q \notin \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;, these rules should have the form &lt;math&gt;P_i^a P_j^b \dots P_k^c \to Q^d&lt;/math&gt;, or, spelled out,

:&lt;math&gt;(P_i=a) \land (P_j=b) \land \dots \land (P_k=c) \to (Q=d)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{a, b, c, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt; are legitimate values from the domains of their respective attributes.  This is a form typical of [[association rules]], and the number of items in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; which match the condition/antecedent is called the ''support'' for the rule.  The method for extracting such rules given in {{Harvtxt|Ziarko|Shan|1995}} is to form a ''decision matrix'' corresponding to each individual value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Informally, the decision matrix for value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; lists all attribute–value pairs that ''differ'' between objects having &lt;math&gt;Q = d &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q \ne d&lt;/math&gt;.

This is best explained by example (which also avoids a lot of notation).  Consider the table above, and let &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; be the decision variable (i.e., the variable on the right side of the implications) and let &lt;math&gt;\{P_1,P_2,P_3\}&lt;/math&gt; be the condition variables (on the left side of the implication). We note that the decision variable &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; takes on two different values, namely &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We treat each case separately.

First, we look at the case &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and we divide up &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; into objects that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and those that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that objects with &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; in this case are simply the objects that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;, but in general, &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; would include all objects having any value for &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; ''other than'' &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and there may be several such classes of objects (for example, those having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2,3,4,etc.&lt;/math&gt;).)  In this case, the objects having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2,O_3,O_7,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; while the objects which have &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{O_4,O_5,O_6,O_8,O_9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The decision matrix for &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; lists all the differences between the objects having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and those having &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;;  that is, the decision matrix lists all the differences between &lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2,O_3,O_7,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{O_4,O_5,O_6,O_8,O_9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We put the "positive" objects (&lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;) as the rows, and the "negative" objects &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; as the columns.

To read this decision matrix, look, for example, at the intersection of row &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; and column &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;, showing &lt;math&gt;P_1^2,P_3^0&lt;/math&gt; in the cell.  This means that ''with regard to'' decision value &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, object &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; differs from object &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt; on attributes &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;, and the particular values on these attributes for the positive object &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;P_1=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3=0&lt;/math&gt;. This tells us that the correct classification of &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; as belonging to decision class &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; rests on attributes &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;;  although one or the other might be dispensable, we know that ''at least one'' of these attributes is ''in''dispensable.

Next, from each decision matrix we form a set of [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] expressions, one expression for each row of the matrix. The items within each cell are aggregated disjunctively, and the individuals cells are then aggregated conjunctively. Thus, for the above table we have the following five Boolean expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \\ 
(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Each statement here is essentially a highly specific (probably ''too'' specific) rule governing the membership in class &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;  of the corresponding object. For example, the last statement, corresponding to object &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, states that all the following must be satisfied: 
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or  &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or both.
# &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0.
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or  &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or both.
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or any combination thereof.
# &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0.

It is clear that there is a large amount of redundancy here, and the next step is to simplify using traditional [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].  The statement &lt;math&gt;(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2)&lt;/math&gt;  corresponding to objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; simplifies to &lt;math&gt;P_1^1  \lor P_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, which yields the implication

:&lt;math&gt;(P_1=1)  \lor (P_2=2) \to (P_{4}=1)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the statement &lt;math&gt;(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; simplifies to &lt;math&gt;P_1^2 P_2^0 \lor P_3^0 P_2^0&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us the implication

:&lt;math&gt;(P_1=2 \land P_2=0) \lor (P_3=0 \land P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1)&lt;/math&gt;

The above implications can also be written as the following rule set:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1=1) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_2=2) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_1=2) \land (P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_3=0) \land (P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1) 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be noted that each of the first two rules has a ''support'' of 1 (i.e., the antecedent matches two objects), while each of the last two rules has a support of 2.  To finish writing the rule set for this knowledge system, the same procedure as above (starting with writing a new decision matrix) should be followed for the case of &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;, thus yielding a new set of implications for that decision value (i.e., a set of implications with &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt; as the consequent). In general, the procedure will be repeated for each possible value of the decision variable.

===LERS rule induction system===

The data system LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Sets) Grzymala-Busse (1997) may induce rules from inconsistent data, i.e., data with conflicting objects.  Two objects are conflicting when they are characterized by the same values of all attributes, but they belong to different concepts (classes). LERS uses rough set theory to compute lower and upper approximations for concepts involved in conflicts with other concepts.

Rules induced from the lower approximation of the concept ''certainly'' describe the concept, hence such rules are called ''certain''.  On the other hand, rules induced from the upper approximation of the concept describe the concept ''possibly'', so these rules are called ''possible''.  For rule induction LERS uses three algorithms: LEM1, LEM2, and IRIM.

The LEM2 algorithm of LERS is frequently used for rule induction and is used not only in LERS but also in other systems, e.g., in RSES (Bazan et al. (2004).  LEM2 explores the search space of [[attribute-value pair]]s.  Its input data set is a lower or upper approximation of a concept, so its input data set is always consistent.  In general, LEM2 computes a local covering and then converts it into a rule set.  We will quote a few definitions to describe the LEM2 algorithm.

The LEM2 algorithm is based on an idea of an attribute-value pair block.  Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty lower or upper approximation of a concept represented by a decision-value pair &lt;math&gt;(d, w)&lt;/math&gt;.  Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ''depends'' on a set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of attribute-value pairs &lt;math&gt;t = (a, v)&lt;/math&gt;  if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \neq [T] = \bigcap_{t \in T} [t] \subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;

Set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a ''minimal complex'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and no proper subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; exists such that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of nonempty sets of attribute-value pairs.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''local covering'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:

each member &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal complex of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
\bigcup_{t \in \mathbb{T}} [T]  = X, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is minimal, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest possible number of members.

For our sample information system, LEM2 will induce the following rules:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1, 1) \to (P_4, 1) \\
(P_5, 0) \to (P_4, 1) \\
(P_1, 0) \to (P_4, 2) \\
(P_2, 1) \to (P_4, 2)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other rule-learning methods can be found, e.g., in Pawlak (1991), Stefanowski (1998), Bazan et al. (2004), etc.

==Incomplete data==

Rough set theory is useful for rule induction from incomplete data sets. Using this approach we can distinguish between three types of missing attribute values: ''lost values'' (the values that were recorded but currently are unavailable), ''attribute-concept values'' (these missing attribute values may be replaced by any attribute value limited to the same concept), and ''"do not care" conditions''  (the original values were irrelevant).  A  ''concept'' (''class'') is a set of all objects classified (or diagnosed) the same way.

Two special data sets with missing attribute values were extensively studied: in the first case, all missing attribute values were lost (Stefanowski and Tsoukias, 2001), in the second case, all missing attribute values were "do not care" conditions (Kryszkiewicz, 1999).

In attribute-concept values interpretation of a missing attribute value, the missing attribute value may be replaced by any value of the attribute domain restricted to the concept to which the object with a missing attribute value belongs (Grzymala-Busse and Grzymala-Busse, 2007).  For example, if for a patient the value of an attribute Temperature is missing, this patient is sick with flu, and all remaining patients sick with flu have values high or very-high for  Temperature when using the interpretation of the missing attribute value as the  attribute-concept value, we will replace the missing attribute value with  high and very-high.  Additionally, the ''characteristic relation'', (see, e.g., Grzymala-Busse and Grzymala-Busse, 2007) enables to process data sets with all three kind of missing attribute values at the same time: lost, "do not care" conditions, and attribute-concept values.

==Applications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

Rough set methods can be applied as a component of hybrid solutions in [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]]. They have been found to be particularly useful for [[rule induction]] and [[feature selection]] (semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction). Rough set-based data analysis methods have been successfully applied in bioinformatics, economics and finance, medicine, multimedia, web and text mining, signal and image processing, software engineering, robotics, and engineering (e.g. power systems and control engineering). Recently the three regions of rough sets are interpreted as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment. This leads to three-way decision making approach with the model which can potentially lead to interesting future applications.

==History==

The idea of rough set was proposed by [[Zdzisław Pawlak|Pawlak]] (1981) as a new mathematical tool to deal with vague concepts. Comer, Grzymala-Busse, Iwinski, Nieminen, Novotny, Pawlak, Obtulowicz, and Pomykala have studied algebraic properties of rough sets. Different algebraic semantics have been developed by P. Pagliani, I. Duntsch, M. K. Chakraborty, M. Banerjee and A. Mani; these have been extended to more generalized rough sets by D. Cattaneo and A. Mani, in particular. Rough sets can be used to represent [[ambiguity]], [[vagueness]] and general [[uncertainty]].

==Extensions and generalizations==

Since the development of rough sets, extensions and generalizations have continued to evolve. Initial developments focused on the relationship - both similarities and difference - with [[fuzzy sets]]. While some literature contends these concepts are different, other literature considers that rough sets are a generalization of fuzzy sets - as represented through either fuzzy rough sets or rough fuzzy sets.  Pawlak (1995) considered that fuzzy and rough sets should be treated as being complementary to each other, addressing different aspects of uncertainty and vagueness.

Three notable extensions of classical rough sets are:
* [[Dominance-based rough set approach]] (DRSA) is an extension of rough set theory for [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński (2001). The main change in this extension of classical rough sets is the substitution of the indiscernibility relation by a ''dominance'' relation, which permits the formalism to deal with inconsistencies typical in consideration of criteria  and preference-ordered decision classes.
* [[Decision-theoretic rough sets]] (DTRS) is a probabilistic extension of rough set theory introduced by Yao, Wong, and Lingras (1990).  It utilizes a Bayesian decision procedure for minimum risk decision making.  Elements are included into the lower and upper approximations based on whether their conditional probability is above thresholds &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt;.  These upper and lower thresholds determine region inclusion for elements.  This model is unique and powerful since the thresholds themselves are calculated from a set of six loss functions representing classification risks.
* [[Game-theoretic rough sets]] (GTRS) is a game theory-based extension of rough set that was introduced by Herbert and Yao (2011). It utilizes a game-theoretic environment to optimize certain criteria of rough sets based classification or decision making in order to obtain effective region sizes.

===Rough membership===

Rough sets can be also defined, as a generalisation, by employing a rough membership function instead of objective approximation. The rough membership function expresses a conditional probability that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R&lt;/math&gt;. This can be interpreted as a degree that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in terms of information about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; expressed by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R&lt;/math&gt;.

Rough membership primarily differs from the fuzzy membership in that the membership of union and intersection of sets cannot, in general, be computed from their constituent membership as is the case of fuzzy sets. In this, rough membership is a generalization of fuzzy membership. Furthermore, the rough membership function is grounded more in probability than the conventionally held concepts of the fuzzy membership function.

===Other generalizations===
Several generalizations of rough sets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems. Here are some of these generalizations:

*rough multisets (Grzymala-Busse, 1987)
*fuzzy rough sets extend the rough set concept through the use of fuzzy equivalence classes(Nakamura, 1988)
*Alpha rough set theory (α-RST) - a generalization of rough set theory that allows approximation using of fuzzy concepts (Quafafou, 2000)
*intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets (Cornelis, De Cock and Kerre, 2003)
*generalized rough fuzzy sets (Feng, 2010)
*rough intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Thomas and Nair, 2011)
*soft rough fuzzy sets and soft fuzzy rough sets (Meng, Zhang and Qin, 2011)
*composite rough sets (Zhang, Li and Chen, 2014)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14819">'''Sexual bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] and [[Sexual harassment|harassment]] that occurs in connection with a person's [[sex]], body,  [[sexual orientation]] or with [[sexual activity]]. It can be [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], or [[emotional abuse|emotional]].

==Definition==
The [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] has defined sexual bullying as "any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The erstwhile [[Beatbullying]] organisation (now defunct) had a similar definition.&lt;ref name=BB01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=56 |title=What is sexual bullying?  |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |date= |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 |quote = {{dead link|date=July 2018}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be the use of sexual words to put someone down, like calling someone a slut, a slag, or gay, or spreading rumours about someone's alleged sex life. In its most extreme form, it can be inappropriate touching, [[sexual assault]] or even [[rape]].&lt;ref name=BB01 /&gt; This term is primarily used in the United Kingdom and is not yet used in other areas.
Definitions and descriptions of bullying and of sexual bullying can be problematic, however. Offensive terms are often deployed in a friendly way, so the context of such exchanges is very important, and adults sometimes misinterpret them. Conversely, while much sexual bullying is overt, a great deal is not, and appears to be ordinary bullying. An example of this is the teasing by tough boys of a 'geeky' boy for his academic ability. What is actually happening is that the boy is being mocked for his lack of machismo, or his lack of engagement in heterosexist banter with girls or boys. Superficially, the bullying has no sexual content, but is underpinned by the aggressors staking a claim to dominance for their 'type of boy' (See Mac An Ghaill, 1994 and Duncan, 1999).

==Prevalence==
As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme commissioned a
questionnaire aimed at young people aged 11–19 years in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBC01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=[[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]  |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey revealed that of the 273 young people who responded to the questionnaire, 28 had been forced to do something sexual and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching.&lt;ref name=NSPCC01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/questions/sexual_bullying_wda70106.html |title=What is sexual bullying and how can I manage it within educational settings? |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Government figures show that in school year 2007/8 there were 3,450 fixed period exclusions and 120 permanent exclusions from schools in [[England]] due to sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name=DCSF01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000860/index.shtml |title=Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2007/08 |publisher=UK Government's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That equates to 19 exclusions per school day&lt;ref name=BB02 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=145&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Beatbullying on Panorama tonight to discuss Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |date= |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for incidents including groping and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, [[ChildLine]] counselled a total of 156,729 children. Of these, 26,134 children spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of these talked specifically about sexual bullying.&lt;ref name=NSPCC03 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf |title=NSPCC policy summary. |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of children who have attended [[Kidscape]] free ZAP anti-bullying sessions have reported some form of sexual bullying.&lt;ref name=kc01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidscape.org.uk/info/sexualbullying.asp |title=Sexual 7 Bullying |publisher=[[Kidscape]] |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122220056/http://kidscape.org.uk/info/sexualbullying.asp |archivedate=22 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant proportion of LGBT students experience homophobic and transphobic violence in school. This is shown consistently by data from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America and the Pacific, with the proportion affected ranging from 16 per cent in Nepal to 85 per cent in the United States. LGBT students are also more likely to experience such violence at school than at home or in the community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT students report a higher prevalence of violence at school than their non-LGBT peers. In New Zealand, for example, lesbian, gay and bisexual students were three times more likely to be bullied than their heterosexual peers and in Norway 15–48 per cent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students reported being bullied compared with 7 per cent of heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types of interactions==
A survey by the UK National Union of Teachers suggests that sexual bullying is most often carried out by boys against girls, although girls are increasingly harassing girls and boys in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name=NUT01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/10552 |title=NUT policy statement on preventing sexual harassment and bullying |publisher=[[National Union of Teachers]] |date= |accessdate=25 Apr 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025547/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/10552 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil01 &gt;Sexual Bullying: Gender Conflict and Pupil Culture in Secondary schools, Neil Duncan, Routledge,1999&lt;/ref&gt; shows that sexual bullying starts at primary school level and usually  takes the form of verbal insults by boys directed at girls and women through demeaning sexually abusive and aggressive language. A NUT study&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NUT02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/4954 |title=A Serious Business: an NUT Report on sexism and harassment in schools |publisher=National Union of Teachers |work=University of Warwick |year=2006 |accessdate=25 Apr 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609071015/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/4954 |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these verbal insults are generally centred on girls' sexual status including terms such as 'bitch', 'slag', 'tart' and 'slut'. Other researchers cite similar evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Divide: Gender in the primary school, M Clark, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents are typically dismissed as playful behaviour or justified through humour, however.&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt; The research also shows that boys are also subjected to a range of sexual bullying by other boys and by girls although this is said to be less obvious. The most prevalent issue is sexual verbal abuse and being called obscene names. The names that cause most offence to boys are homophobic terms and those that are associated with the 'absence' of high status masculinity.&lt;ref name=NUT01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil01/&gt; Sexual bullying can involve spreading rumours about someone's sexuality or sex life,&lt;ref name="Womankind guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=C.|last2=Wharf|first2=H.|title=Stop sexual bullying: Preventing violence, promoting equality: Act now|url=http://www.womankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/published-YP-report-Nov-2010.pdf|website=WOMANKIND Worldwide|publisher=WOMANKIND Worldwide|accessdate=23 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203094243/http://www.womankind.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/published-YP-report-Nov-2010.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or showing or posting sexual comments, photos, or videos,&lt;ref name=Kidshealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual harassment and sexual bullying|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/harassment.html#|website=TeensHealth|publisher=The Nemours Foundation|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[revenge porn]].

Some people, including the UK charity [[Beatbullying]], have claimed that children are being bullied into providing 'sexual favours' in exchange for protection as gang culture enters inner city schools.&lt;ref name=BBC02 &gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6500005.stm |title= Girls bullied for 'sex favours'  |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= 27 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the [[National Union of Teachers]], challenged the charity to provide evidence of this, as they had no evidence that this sort of behaviour was happening in schools.&lt;ref name=BBC02 /&gt;

==Associated effects and risks==
[[Bullying]] victimization occurs more frequently in [[sexual minorities]] than [[heterosexual]] individuals.&lt;ref name="Ref1 Phys Health Disparities"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=J.

[[Anti-gay]] physical bullying, along with [[sexual abuse]] and verbal bullying, can lead to [[psychosocial]] health problems, which can be a predictor of risky sex behaviours.&lt;ref name="Ref4 GBM" /&gt; Men who have sex with men in the United States and Canada have a higher prevalence of [[HIV]] than any other cohort.&lt;ref name="Ref4 GBM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulloch|first1=T.

'''''The Anatomy of Power''''' is a [[1983 in literature|1983]] book by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[economist]] [[John Kenneth Galbraith]].  It sought to classify three types of power: ''compensatory power'' in which submission is bought, ''condign power'' in which submission is won by making the alternative sufficiently painful, and ''conditioned power'' in which submission is gained by persuasion.  In short; money, force and ideology.

It further divided power by source: power either stems from ''personality'' or leadership, ''property'' or wealth, or ''organisation''.

The book goes on to detail a brief history of the use of power, noting the broad arc of history in moving away from condign and towards compensatory and then conditioned power, and from personality and property towards organisation.  Finally, it details what Galbraith views as the main sources of power in the modern world: government, the military, religion and the press.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">The '''First Law of Geography''', according to [[Waldo Tobler]], is "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."&lt;ref&gt;Tobler W., (1970) "A computer movie simulating urban growth in the Detroit region". ''Economic Geography'', 46(Supplement): 234-240.&lt;/ref&gt; This first law is the foundation of the fundamental concepts of [[spatial dependence]] and [[spatial autocorrelation]] and is utilized specifically for the [[inverse distance weighting]] method for [[spatial interpolation]] and to support the [[regionalized variable theory]] for [[kriging]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Karen.  "Encyclopedia of Geographic Information Science", SAGE, 2008, p146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobler first presented his seminal idea during a meeting of the [[International Geographical Union]]'s Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, "the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately homogeneous conditions to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Michael John; Goodchild, Michael F.; Longley, Paul. "Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles, Techniques and Software Tools", Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2007, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known is his second law, which complements the first: "The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside".&lt;ref&gt;Linear pycnophylactic reallocation—Comment on a paper by D. Martin, ''International Journal of Geographical Information Science'', 13(1), 85-90, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and background==
The theory is based upon the concept of the [[friction of distance]] "where distance itself hinders interaction between places. The farther two places are apart, the greater the hindrance",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Meredith; Alagona, Peter S. "AP Human Geography 2008", Barron's Educational Series, 91-92, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or cost. For example, one is less likely to travel across town to purchase a sandwich than walk to the corner store for the same sandwich. In this example hindrance, or cost, can readily be counted in time and transportation costs which are added to the price of the purchase and thus result in high levels of friction. The friction of distance and the increase in cost combine causing the [[distance decay]] effect.

'''''Weltschmerz''''' (from the German, literally ''world-pain'', also ''world weariness'', {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʃmɛɐ̯ts|pron}}) is a term coined by the German author [[Jean Paul]] and denotes the kind of feeling experienced by someone who believes that physical reality can never satisfy the demands of the mind.{{cn|date=June 2018}} This kind of [[world view]] was widespread among several [[romanticism|romantic]] and [[decadent movement|decadent]] authors such as [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[William Blake]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Giacomo Leopardi]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Nikolaus Lenau]],&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braun|first1=Wilhelm Afred|title=Types of Weltschmerz in German Poetry|date=1905|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C58tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=weltschmerz+heinrich+heine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TWO6WoD9bz&amp;sig=N5V6VYVUmyW3GfPQbf_tSNeXGKE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA54Dq_YDMAhUC6yYKHSVdB-MQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=weltschmerz%20heinrich%20heine&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Hesse]],&lt;ref name="Stelzig"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stelzig|first1=Eugene L.|title=Hermann Hesse's Fictions of the Self: Autobiography and the Confessional Imagination|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-06750-3|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwQABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=weltschmerz+hermann+hesse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Vgdf1LOxk&amp;sig=_jzL8PW02vdf5liGPmk_TuTE5rI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-joSf_IDMAhUBQCYKHfh7AKY4ChDoAQgiMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=weltschmerz%20hermann%20hesse&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt;

[[Frederick C. Beiser]] defines ''Weltschmerz'' more broadly as "a mood of weariness or sadness about life arising from the acute awareness of evil and suffering",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwRDAAAQBAJ |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |last=Beiser |first=Frederick C. |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191081347 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that by the 1860s the word was used ironically in Germany to refer to oversensitivity to those same concerns.

==Further examples==
[[John Steinbeck]] wrote about this feeling in ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' and referred to it as the ''Welshrats''; and in ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', Samuel Hamilton feels it after meeting Cathy Trask for the first time. [[Ralph Ellison]] uses the term in ''[[Invisible Man]]'' with regard to the pathos inherent in the singing of spirituals: "beneath the swiftness of the hot tempo there was a slower tempo and a cave and I entered it and looked around and heard an old woman singing a spiritual as full of Weltschmerz as [[flamenco]]". [[Kurt Vonnegut]] references this feeling in his novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''; it is felt by Doctor Paul Proteus and his father. In [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', he describes an acquaintance, "Moldorf", who has prescriptions for Weltschmerz on scraps of paper in his pocket.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">In [[mathematics]], '''point-free geometry''' is a [[geometry]] whose primitive [[ontology|ontological]] notion is ''region'' rather than [[point (geometry)|point]]. Two [[axiomatic system]]s are set out below, one grounded in [[mereology]], the other in [[mereotopology]] and known as ''connection theory''. A point can mark a space or objects.

==Motivation==
Point-free geometry was first formulated in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] (1919, 1920), not as a theory of [[geometry]] or of [[spacetime]], but of "events" and of an "extension relation" between events. Whitehead's purposes were as much philosophical as scientific and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;See Kneebone (1963), chpt. 13.5, for a gentle introduction to Whitehead's theory. Also see Lucas (2000), chpt. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead did not set out his theories in a manner that would satisfy present-day canons of formality. The two formal [[first order theory|first order theories]] described in this entry were devised by others in order to clarify and refine Whitehead's theories. The [[domain of discourse|domain]] for both theories consists of "regions." All unquantified variables in this entry should be taken as tacitly [[Quantification (logic)|universally quantified]]; hence all axioms should be taken as universal closures. No axiom requires more than three quantified variables; hence a translation of first order theories into [[relation algebra]] is possible. Each set of axioms has but four [[existential quantifier]]s.

==Inclusion-based point-free geometry ([[mereology]])==
The axioms '''G1-G7''' are, but for numbering, those of Def. 2.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008) (see also Gerla (1995)). The identifiers of the form '''WPn''', included in the verbal description of each axiom, refer to the corresponding axiom in Simons (1987: 83).

The fundamental primitive [[binary relation]] is ''Inclusion'', denoted by [[infix]] "&amp;le;". (''Inclusion'' corresponds to the binary ''Parthood'' relation that is a standard feature of all mereological theories.) The intuitive meaning of ''x''&amp;le;''y'' is "''x'' is part of ''y''." Assuming that [[identity function|identity]], denoted by infix "=", is part of the background logic, the [[binary relation]] ''Proper Part'', denoted by infix "&lt;", is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; x&lt;y \leftrightarrow (x\le y \and x \not = y).&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms are:
*Inclusion [[partial order|partially orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]].
:'''G1.'''  &lt;math&gt;x\le x.&lt;/math&gt;      ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]])
:'''G2.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le z \and z\le y) \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[transitive relation|transitive]]) '''WP4'''.
:'''G3.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le y \and  y\le x) \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]])

*Given any two regions, there exists a region that includes both of them. '''WP6'''.
:'''G4.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists z[x\le z\and y\le z].&lt;/math&gt;

*Proper Part [[dense order|densely orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]]. '''WP5'''.
:'''G5.''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y\rightarrow\exists z [x&lt;z&lt;y].&lt;/math&gt;

*Both [[atomic (order theory)|atomic regions]] and a [[mereology|universal region]] do not exist. Hence the [[domain of discourse|domain]] has neither an upper nor a lower bound. '''WP2'''.
:'''G6.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[y&lt;x \and x&lt;z].&lt;/math&gt;

* Proper Parts Principle. If all the proper parts of ''x'' are proper parts of ''y'', then ''x'' is included in ''y''. '''WP3'''. 
:'''G7.''' &lt;math&gt;\forall z[z&lt;x \rightarrow z&lt;y] \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[model theory|model]] of '''G1–G7''' is an ''inclusion space''.

'''Definition''' (Gerla and Miranda 2008: Def. 4.1). Given some inclusion space, an '''abstractive class''' is a class ''G'' of regions such that ''G'' is [[total order|totally ordered]] by Inclusion. Moreover, there does not exist a region included in all of the regions included in ''G''.

Intuitively, an abstractive class defines a geometrical entity whose dimensionality is less than that of the inclusion space. For example, if the inclusion space is the [[Euclidean plane]], then the corresponding abstractive classes are [[point (geometry)|point]]s and [[line (geometry)|line]]s.

Inclusion-based point-free geometry (henceforth "point-free geometry") is essentially an axiomatization of Simons's (1987: 83) system '''W.''' In turn, '''W''' formalizes a theory in Whitehead (1919) whose axioms are not made explicit. Point-free geometry is '''W''' with this defect repaired. Simons (1987) did not repair this defect, instead proposing in a footnote that the reader do so as an exercise. The primitive relation of '''W''' is Proper Part, a [[strict partial order]]. The theory&lt;ref&gt;Kneebone (1963), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; of Whitehead (1919) has a single primitive binary relation ''K'' defined as ''xKy'' &amp;harr; ''y''&lt;''x''. Hence ''K'' is the [[converse relation|converse]] of Proper Part. Simons's '''WP1''' asserts that Proper Part is [[irreflexive]] and so corresponds to '''G1'''. '''G3''' establishes that inclusion, unlike Proper Part, is [[Antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]].

Point-free geometry is closely related to a [[List of first-order theories|dense linear order]] '''D''', whose axioms are '''G1-3''', '''G5''', and the totality axiom &lt;math&gt; x \le y \or y \le x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Stoll, R. R., 1963. ''Set Theory and Logic''. Dover reprint, 1979. P. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence inclusion-based point-free geometry would be a proper extension of '''D''' (namely '''D'''&amp;cup;{'''G4''', '''G6''', '''G7'''}), were it not that the '''D''' relation "&amp;le;" is a [[total order]].

==Connection theory==
In his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] proposed a different approach, one inspired by De Laguna (1922). Whitehead took as primitive the [[topological]] notion of "contact" between two regions, resulting in a primitive "connection relation" between events. Connection theory '''C''' is a [[first order theory]] that distills the first 12 of the 31 assumptions in chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]'' into 6 axioms, '''C1-C6'''. '''C''' is a proper fragment of the theories proposed in Clarke (1981), who noted their [[mereology|mereological]] character. Theories that, like '''C''', feature both inclusion and [[topology|topological]] primitives, are called [[mereotopology|mereotopologies]].

'''C''' has one primitive [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], binary "connection," denoted by the [[prefix]]ed [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate letter]] ''C''. That ''x'' is included in ''y'' can now be defined as ''x''&amp;le;''y'' &amp;harr; &amp;forall;z[''Czx''&amp;rarr;''Czy'']. Unlike the case with inclusion spaces, connection theory enables defining "non-tangential" inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably this is Casati and Varzi's (1999) "Internal Part" predicate, IP''xy'' &amp;harr; (x&amp;le;y)&amp;and;(C''zx''&amp;rarr;&amp;exist;''v''[''v''&amp;le;''z'' &amp;and; ''v''&amp;le;''y'']. This definition combines their (4.8) and (3.1).&lt;/ref&gt; a total order that enables the construction of abstractive classes. Gerla and Miranda (2008) argue that only thus can mereotopology unambiguously define a [[Point (geometry)|point]].

The axioms '''C1-C6''' below are, but for numbering, those of Def. 3.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008).

*''C'' is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. '''C.1.'''
:'''C1. '''&lt;math&gt; \ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[symmetric]]. '''C.2.'''
:'''C2.'''  &lt;math&gt;Cxy\rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[extensionality|extensional]]. '''C.11.'''
:'''C3.'''   &lt;math&gt;\forall z[Czx \leftrightarrow Czy] \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;

* All regions have proper parts, so that '''C''' is an [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] theory. '''P.9.'''
:'''C4.'''    &lt;math&gt;\exists y[y&lt;x].&lt;/math&gt;

*Given any two regions, there is a region connected to both of them.
:'''C5.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists z[Czx\and Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

*All regions have at least two unconnected parts. '''C.14.'''
:'''C6.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[(y\le x)\and (z\le x)\and\neg Cyz].&lt;/math&gt;

A model of '''C''' is a ''connection space''.

Following the verbal description of each axiom is the identifier of the corresponding axiom in Casati and Varzi (1999). Their system '''SMT''' (''strong mereotopology'') consists of '''C1-C3''', and is essentially due to Clarke (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorczyk (1960) proposed a similar theory, whose motivation was primarily [[topology|topological]].&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[mereotopology]] can be made [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] by invoking '''C4''', without risking paradox or triviality. Hence '''C''' extends the atomless variant of '''SMT''' by means of the axioms '''C5''' and '''C6''', suggested by chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]''. For an advanced and detailed discussion of systems related to '''C''', see Roeper (1997).

Biacino and Gerla (1991) showed that every [[model theory|model]] of Clarke's theory is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and models of such algebras cannot distinguish connection from overlap. It is doubtful whether either fact is faithful to Whitehead's intent.
