Since developing AMOVA, Excoffier has written a [[computer program|program]] for running such analyses. This program, which runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] is called [[Arlequin]], and is freely available on Excoffier's website. There is also an implementation by Sandrine Pavoine in [[R language]] in the ade4 package available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).

An '''apologue''' or '''apolog''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀπόλογος, a "statement" or "account") is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly.  Unlike a [[fable]], the moral is more important than the narrative details.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apologue|volume=2|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[parable]], the apologue is a tool of [[rhetoric]]al [[argument]] used to convince or persuade.

Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of [[Jotham]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:7-15); "The Belly and its Members," by the patrician [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Agrippa Menenius Lanatus]] in the second book of [[Livy]]; and perhaps most famous of all, those of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Well-known modern examples of this literary form include [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and the [[Br'er Rabbit]] stories derived from African and [[Cherokee]] cultures and recorded and synthesized by [[Joel Chandler Harris]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a [[fable]] in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as "a satire in action."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

An apologue differs from a [[parable]] in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be ''true'' in the sense that "when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: "when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it."  The [[parable]] reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander).  It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, [[Martin Luther]] thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} for the main text, but the origin of the examples is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2017/01/calamity.html|title=Calamity|website=www.shonmehta.com|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with [[allegory]], [[metaphor]] and [[imagination]]. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the [[slave]]s, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely [[Aesop]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. [[La Fontaine]] in France; [[John Gay|Gay]] and [[Robert Dodsley|Dodsley]] in England; [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert|Gellert]], [[Lessing]] and [[Friedrich von Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in Germany; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Tomas de Iriarte]] in Spain, and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] in Russia, were leading later writers of apologues.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, "Le Coq et la Perle" ("The Cock and the Pearl").&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

''"A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining amid the straw. “Ho! ho!” quoth he, “that’s for me,” and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? “You may be a treasure,” quoth Master Cock, “to men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.”''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On the other hand, in the romances of [[Reynard the Fox]] we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, [[Corti]], is said to have developed an apologue of "The Talking Animals" reaching twenty-six [[canto]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Antoine Houdar de la Motte|La Motte]], writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters [[amour-propre]] by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but [[Rousseau]] contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A work by P. Soullé, ''La Fontaine et ses devanciers'' (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] wrote a propos his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' "There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be ''felt''.  Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy."{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">'''Bioconversion''', also known as ''biotransformation'', is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms. One example is the industrial production of [[cortisone]], which one step is the bioconversion of [[progesterone]] to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by ''[[Rhizopus nigricans]].'' Another example is the [[Bioconversion of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol|bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol]], which is part of scientific research for many decades.

Another example of bioconversion is the [[Conversion (chemistry)|conversion]] of [[organic material]]s, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain [[microorganism]]s, some [[detritivore]]s or [[enzyme]]s.

In the USA, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&amp;D for the [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New [[cellulosic ethanol]] conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of [[feedstock]] that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), [[sludge]], [[sewage]], etc.

==Three different processes for bioconversion==
1 -''' Enzymatic hydrolysis''' - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. [[Genencor]] and [[Novozymes]] are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process.

2 - '''Synthesis gas fermentation''' - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is [[gasified]] in a closed environment into a [[syngas]] containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brienergy.com/|title=Clean Technology for Renewable Energy|website=www.brienergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria  (''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'') are used to convert the syngas ([[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co-generate excess electricity.

This type of engineered system introduces a substantial innovation represented by the automatic modulation of the treatment, able to adapt conditions of the system to the biology of the scavenger used, improving their performances and the power of this technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">The '''Blytt-Sernander''' classification, or sequence, is a series of north [[Europe]]an climatic periods or phases based on the study of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[peat bog]]s by [[Axel Blytt]] (1876) and [[Rutger Sernander]] (1908). The classification was incorporated into a sequence of [[pollen zone]]s later defined by [[Lennart von Post]], one of the founders of [[palynology]].

==Description==
Layers in [[peat]] were first noticed by [[Heinrich Dau]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Dau, ''Allerunterthänigster Bericht an die Königliche Dänische Rentekammer über die Torfmoore Seelands nach einer im Herbste 1828 deshalb unternommenen Reise.'' (usually simply ''Über die Torfmoore Seelands'') Copenhagen and Leipzig, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; A prize was offered by the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] to anyone who could explain them. Blytt hypothesized that the darker layers were deposited in drier times; the lighter, in moister times, applying his terms ''Atlantic'' (warm, moist) and ''Boreal'' (cool, dry). In 1926 [[C.A. Weber]]&lt;ref&gt;Weber, "Grenzhorizont und Klimaschwankungen" ''Abhandl. Naturwiss. Vereins, Bremen''  '''26''' (1926:98-106).&lt;/ref&gt; noticed the sharp boundary horizons, or ''Grenzhorizonte'', in [[Germany|German]] peat, which matched Blytt’s classification. Sernander defined subboreal and subatlantic periods, as well as the late glacial periods. Other scientists have since added other information.

The classification was devised before the development of more accurate dating methods, such as [[Radiocarbon dating|C-14 dating]] and [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s. Currently geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs and [[ice core]] samples by a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt-Sernander sequence. They find a general correspondence across [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].

The fluctuations of climatic change are more complex than Blytt-Sernander periodizations can identify. For example, recent peat [[core sample]]s at [[Roskilde Fjord]] and also [[Lake Kornerup]] in [[Denmark]] identified 40 to 62 distinguishable layers of [[pollen]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, no universally accepted replacement model has been proposed.

==Problems==

===Dating and calibration===
Today the Blytt-Sernander sequence has been substantiated by a wide variety of scientific dating methods, mainly [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates obtained from peat. Earlier radiocarbon dates were often left uncalibrated; that is, they were derived by assuming a constant concentration of atmospheric radiocarbon. In fact the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration has varied over time and thus radiocarbon dates need to be [[Radiocarbon dating|calibrated]].

===Cross-discipline correlation===
The Blytt-Sernander classification has been used as a temporal framework for the [[archaeology|archaeological cultures]] of [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. Some have gone so far as to identify stages of technology in north Europe with specific periods; however, this approach is an oversimplification not generally accepted. There is no reason, for example, why the north [[Europe]]ans should stop using [[bronze]] and start using [[iron]] abruptly at the lower boundary of the [[Subatlantic]] at 600 BC. In the warm [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]] period, [[Denmark]] was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] cultures, rather than [[Neolithic]], notwithstanding the climatic evidence. Moreover, the technology stages vary widely globally.

==Sequence==
The [[Pleistocene]] phases and approximate calibrated dates (see above) are:
* [[Older Dryas]] stadial, 14,000–13,600 BP ([[Before Present]])
* [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] interstadial, 13,600–12,900 BP
* [[Younger Dryas]] stadial, 12,900–11,640 BP

The [[Holocene]] phases are:
* [[Preboreal]]
* [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]], cool, dry, rising temperature, 11,500–8,900 BP
* [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]], warm, moist, maximum temperature, 8900–5700 BP
* [[Subboreal]], 5700–2600 BP
* [[Subatlantic]], 2600–0 BP

==Marker species==
Some marker plant [[genus|genera]]/[[species]] studied in [[peat]] are
*''[[Sphagnum]]''
*''[[Carex limosa]]''
*''[[Scheuchzeria palustris]]'', Rannock rush
*''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]'', cotton grass
*''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]'', bog cranberry
*''[[Andromeda polifolia]]'', bog rosemary
*''[[Erica tetralix]]'', cross-leaved heather
*''[[Calluna vulgaris]]'', heather
*''[[Pine|Pinus]]'', pine
*''[[Birch|Betula]]'', birch

More [[sphagnum]] appears in wet periods. Dry periods feature more tree stumps, of birch and pine.

The '''Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation''' ('''CSIRO''') is an independent [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] agency responsible for scientific research. Its chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of industry for the benefit of the community. 

CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world. From its headquarters in Canberra, CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States, employing about 5500 people.

Federally funded scientific research began in Australia {{age|1916|6|1}} years ago. The Advisory Council of Science and Industry was established in 1916 but was hampered by insufficient available finance.  In 1926 the research effort was reinvigorated by establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding. CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. In 1949 further legislated changes included re-naming the organisation as CSIRO.

Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], essential components of [[Wi-Fi]] technology, development of the first commercially successful [[polymer banknote]], the invention of the insect repellent in [[Aerogard]] and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia, such as the introduction of [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]] for the control of [[European rabbit|rabbit]] populations.

== Structure ==
CSIRO is governed by a board appointed by the Australian Government, currently chaired by [[David Thodey]]{{post-nominals|country=AUS|A0}}. There are nine directors inclusive of the Chief Executive, presently Dr. [[Larry R. Marshall|Larry Marshall]], who is responsible for management of the organisation.

== History ==
===Evolution of the organisation===
A precursor to CSIRO, the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, was established in 1916 on the initiative of prime minister [[Billy Hughes]]. However, the Advisory Council struggled with insufficient funding during the First World War. In 1920 the Council was renamed the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and was led by [[George Handley Knibbs]] (1921–26), but continued to struggle financially.

In 1926 the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] modified the principal Act for national scientific research (the ''Institute of Science and Industry Act 1920'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 22 |date= 14 September 1920 |url= http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/iosaia1920221920384.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by passing ''The Science and Industry Research Act 1926''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 20 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= http://www5.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/saira1926201926306.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Act replaced the Institute with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). With encouragement from prime minister [[Stanley Bruce]], strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding, CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. The council was structured to represent the federal structure of government in Australia, and had state-level committees and a central council. In addition to an improved structure, CSIR benefited from strong bureaucratic management under [[George Julius]], [[David Rivett]], and Arnold Richardson. Research focused on primary and secondary industries. Early in its existence, CSIR established divisions studying animal health and animal nutrition. After the [[Great Depression]], research was extended into manufacturing and other secondary industries.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/our-history/ |title= Our history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 the Act was changed again&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1949 |number= 13 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012C00352/Download |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the entity name amended to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The amendment enlarged and reconstituted the organisation and its administrative structure. Under [[Ian Clunies Ross]] as chairman, CSIRO pursued new areas such as radio astronomy and industrial chemistry. CSIRO still operates under the provisions of the 1949 Act in a wide range of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;

Since 1949 CSIRO has expanded its activities to almost every field of primary, secondary and tertiary industry, including the environment, human nutrition, conservation, urban and rural planning, and water.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; It works with leading organisations around the world and maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States of America, employing about 5500 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csiro.au/en/About/International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/International |title=International collaboration – CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-01-28 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic research===
CSIRO had a pioneering role in the scientific discovery of the universe through radio "eyes". A team led by [[Paul Wild (Australian scientist)|Paul Wild]] built and operated (from 1948) the world’s first solar radiospectrograph, and from 1967 the {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} radioheliograph at Culgoora in New South Wales. For three decades, the Division of Radiophysics had a world-leading role in solar research, attracting prominent solar physicists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |title=Dr John Paul Wild |publisher=CSIRO |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125053338/http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |archivedate=25 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO owned the first computer in Australia, [[CSIRAC]], built as part of a project began in the Sydney Radiophysics Laboratory in 1947. The CSIR Mk 1 ran its first program in 1949, the fifth electronic computer in the world. It was over 1,000 times faster than the mechanical calculators available at the time. It was decommissioned in 1955 and recommissioned in Melbourne as CSIRAC in 1956 as a general purpose computing machine used by over 700 projects until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |title=CSIRAC |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |work=Department of Computer Science and Engineering |accessdate=2006-05-08 |author1=Steven Pass |author2=David Hornsby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227165717/http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRAC is the only surviving first-generation computer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/csirac/ |title=Museum Victoria's CSIRAC information site|accessdate=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1965 and 1985, [[George Bornemissza]] of CSIRO's Division of Entomology founded and led the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]]. Bornemissza, upon settling in Australia from Hungary in 1951, noticed that the pastureland was covered in dry cattle dung pads which did not seem to be recycled into the soil and caused areas of rank pasture which were unpalatable to the cattle. He proposed that the reason for this was that native Australian dung beetles, which had co-evolved alongside the marsupials (which produce dung very different in its composition from cattle), were not adapted to utilise cattle dung for their nutrition and breeding since cattle had only relatively recently been introduced to the continent in the 1880s. The Australian Dung Beetle Project sought, therefore, to introduce species of dung beetle from South Africa and Europe (which had co-evolved alongside bovids) in order to improve the fertility and quality of cattle pastures. Twenty-three species were successfully introduced throughout the duration of the project and also had the effect of reducing the pestilent bush fly population by 90%.&lt;ref name="adbp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bornemissza G. F. | year = 1976 | title = The Australian dung beetle project 1965–1975 | url = | journal = Australian Meat Research Committee Review | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Missylisa153, August 2009---&gt;

===Domain name===
CSIRO was the first Australian organisation to start using the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |title=AARNET – About Us – History |publisher=[[Australian Academic and Research Network]] |accessdate=16 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412054848/https://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was able to register the [[second-level domain]] csiro.au (as opposed to csiro.org.au or csiro.com.au).  Guidelines were introduced in 1996 to regulate the use of the [[.au]] domain.

When CSIR was formed in 1926, it was led initially by an Executive Committee of three people, two of whom were designated as the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Since then the roles and responsibilities of the Chair and Chief Executive have changed many times. From 1927 to 1986 the head of CSIR (and from 1949, CSIRO)&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; was the Chairman, who was responsible for the management of the organisation, supported by the Chief Executive. From 1 July 1959 to 4 December 1986 CSIRO had no Chief Executive; the Chairman undertook both functions.&lt;ref name="heads"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/heads-of-csiro-2/ |title= Chief Executives and Chairs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, when the [[Hawke Government|Australian Government]] changed the structure of CSIRO to include a board of non-executive members plus the Chief Executive to lead CSIRO, the roles changed. The Chief Executive is now responsible for management of the organisation in accordance with the strategy, plans and policies approved by the CSIRO Board which, led by the Chair of the Board, is responsible to the Australian Government for the overall strategy, governance and performance of CSIRO.&lt;ref name="heads"/&gt;

As with its governance structure, the priorities and structure of CSIRO, and the teams and facilities that implement its research, have changed as Australia's scientific challenges have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/organisational-history/ |title= Organisational history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Total Wellbeing Diet===
In 2005 the CSIRO gained worldwide attention, including some criticism, for promoting a high-[[protein]], low-[[carbohydrate]] diet of their own creation called ''[[Total Wellbeing Diet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Health-and-Wellbeing/Prevention/Total-Wellbeing-Diet-online.aspx |title=CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet online - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRO published the diet in a book which sold over half a million copies in Australia and over 100,000 overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-24 |title=The town taking the CSIRO challenge |work=[[A Current Affair (Australian TV program)|A Current Affair]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051213020826/http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet was criticised in an editorial by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' for giving scientific credence to a "fashionable" diet sponsored by meat and dairy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/peers-turn-up-heat-on-csiro-diet/2005/12/27/1135445573297.html |title=Peers turn up heat on CSIRO diet |publisher=The Age |date=28 December 2005 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classicbackissues.australasianscience.com.au/bi2006/272CSIROdiet.pdf |title=Nature Gags on CSIRO Diet |publisher=Australasian Science |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===802.11 patent===
In the early 1990s, CSIRO radio astronomy scientists John O'Sullivan, Graham Daniels, Terence Percival, Diethelm Ostry and John Deane undertook research directed to finding a way to make wireless networks work as fast as wired networks within confined spaces such as office buildings. The technique they developed, involving a particular combination of [[forward error correction]], frequency-domain interleaving, and [[multi-carrier modulation]], became the subject of {{US Patent|5487069}}, which was granted on 23 January 1996.

In 1997 Macquarie University professor David Skellern and his colleague Neil Weste established the company Radiata, Inc., which took a nonexclusive licence to the CSIRO patent for the purpose of developing commercially viable integrated circuit devices implementing the patented technology.&lt;ref name=Radiata&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Mark |title=Creating and Exploiting Intangible Networks: How Radiata was able to improve its odds of success in the risky process of innovating |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/3C2255E6-B6E5-49EB-BB96-1FBA94EB0EA4/1372/radiata.pdf |publisher=Australian Government, Department of Education, Science and Training |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author2=Bob Frater |pages=8–9 &amp; 16 |format=PDF |date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the [[IEEE 802.11]] Working Group was developing the 802.11a wireless LAN standard. CSIRO did not participate directly in the standards process, however David Skellern was an active participant as secretary of the Working Group, and representative of Radiata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skellern |first=David |title=Tentative Minutes of the IEEE P802.11 Full Working Group |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Minutes/Cons_Minutes_99July.pdf |publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=5–9 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 it became apparent that the CSIRO patent would be pertinent to the standard. In response to a request from Victor Hayes of Lucent Technologies, who was Chair of the 802.11 Working Group, CSIRO confirmed its commitment to make non-exclusive licenses available to implementers of the standard on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Dennis |title=Letter to Mr V Hayes, Chair, IEEE P802.11 |url=http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/loa-802_11a-csiro-04Dec1998.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=4 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Cisco Systems]], Inc. and [[Broadcom]] Corporation each invested A$4&amp;nbsp;million in Radiata, representing an 11% stake for each investor and valuing the company at around A$36&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt; In September 2000, Radiata demonstrated a chip set complying with the recently finalised IEEE 802.11a Wi-Fi standard, and capable of handling transmission rates of up to 54 Mbit/s, at a major international exhibition.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt;

In November 2000, Cisco acquired Radiata in exchange for US$295&amp;nbsp;million in Cisco common stock with the intention of incorporating the Radiata Baseband Processor and Radio chips into its Aironet family of wireless LAN products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release: Cisco Systems to Acquire Radiata, Inc. |url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |publisher=Cisco Systems, Inc. |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011124055012/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |archivedate=24 November 2001 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cisco subsequently took a large write-down on the Radiata acquisition, following the 2001 [[telecoms crash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heskett |first=Ben |title=Cisco still confident after networking shock |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/cisco-still-confident-after-networking-shock/119211 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 it shut down its internal development of wireless chipsets based on the Radiata technology in order to focus on software development and emerging new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |title=Cisco retires wireless chipsets |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033_3-5151131.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CNET News |date=30 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the CSIRO patent arose in 2006 after the organisation won an injunction against [[Buffalo Technology]] in an infringement suit filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO wins landmark legal battle |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/wireless--broadband/csiro-wins-landmark-legal-battle/2006/11/15/1163266614119.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Age |date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction was subsequently suspended on appeal, with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finding that the judge in Texas should have allowed a trial to proceed on Buffalo’s challenge to the validity of the CSIRO patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Venkatesan |first=Arun |title=Buffalo Allowed to sell wireless products again (for now) |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/03/buffalo-allowed-to-sell-wireless-products-again-for-now/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechCrunch |date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, CSIRO declined to provide an assurance to the IEEE that it would not sue companies which refused to take a license for use in 802.11n-compliant devices, while at the same time continuing to defend legal challenges to the validity of the patent brought by [[Intel]], [[Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Netgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winterford |first=Brett |title=No backdown from CSIRO over Wi-Fi patents |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/systems-management/2007/10/02/no-backdown-from-csiro-over-wi-fi-patents-39289756/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Hewlett-Packard broke ranks with the rest of the industry becoming the first to reach a settlement of its dispute with CSIRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO cashes in on patent claim |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/csiro-cashes-in-on-patent-claim/2009/04/01/1238261630683.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was followed quickly by settlements with Microsoft, [[Fujitsu]] and [[Asus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duckett |first=Chris |title=Microsoft, Fujitsu, Asus settle with CSIRO |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/microsoft-fujitsu-asus-settle-with-csiro-339295967.htm |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Dell, Intel, [[Nintendo]], [[Toshiba]], Netgear, Buffalo, [[D-Link]], [[Belkin]], [[SMC Networks|SMC]], [[Accton]], and [[3Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent lawsuits conclude with the final 13 companies set |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/22/csiros-patent-lawsuits-conclude-with-the-final-13-companies-set/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=David |title=CSIRO could scoop billions from Wi-Fi patent |url=http://apcmag.com/csiro-could-scoop-billions-from-wi-fi-patent.htm |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=APC Magazine |date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy grew after CSIRO sued US carriers [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon]] and [[T-Mobile]] in 2010, with the organisation being accused of being "Australia's biggest patent troll", a wrathful "patent bully", and of imposing a "WiFi tax" on American innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Popper |first=Ben |title=Australia's Biggest Patent Troll Goes After AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-43340647/australias-biggest-patent-troll-goes-after-at038t-verizon-and-t-mobile/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CBS News |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent fight targets more victims: AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/21/csiros-patent-fight-targets-more-victims-atandt-verizon-wireles/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=CSIRO Wants To Expand Its WiFi Tax: Sues Mobile Operators |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100601/1913309652.shtml |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechDirt |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further fuel was added to the controversy after a settlement with the carriers, worth around $229&amp;nbsp;million, was announced in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |title=Champagne at CSIRO after WiFi patent settlement |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/01/csiro_settles_with_carriers/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Register |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |title=WiFi patent case results in $229 million payment to Australian government |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/wifi-patent-case-results-in-229m-payment-to-australian-government/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged in part by an announcement by the Australian Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Media Release: Aussie scientists bring home millions in wifi windfall |url=http://minister.innovation.gov.au/chrisevans/MediaReleases/Pages/millionsinwifiwindfall.aspx |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=13 May 2012 |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an article in [[Ars Technica]] portrayed CSIRO as a shadowy organisation responsible for US consumers being compelled to make "a multimillion dollar donation" on the basis of a questionable patent claiming "decades old" technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=Joe |title=How the Aussie government "invented WiFi" and sued its way to $430 million |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/how-the-aussie-government-invented-wifi-and-sued-its-way-to-430-million/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting debate became so heated that the author was compelled to follow up with a defence of the original article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=Joe |title=Responses and clarifications on the CSIRO patent lawsuits |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/op-ed/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view was also published on [[The Register]], challenging a number of the assertions made in the Ars Technica piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |title=CSIRO patent-trolls ALL OF AMERICA! |date=10 April 2012|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/10/csiro_patent_trolls_wifi/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Register }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetically modified wheat trials===
On 14 July 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists vandalised a crop of GM wheat, circumventing the scientific trials being undertaken. Greenpeace was forced to pay reparations to CSIRO of $280,000 for the criminal damage, and were accused by the sentencing judge, Justice Hilary Penfold, of cynically using junior members of the organisation with good standing to avoid custodial sentences, while the offenders were given 9-month suspended sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/greenpeace-activists-in-costly-gm-protest-20120802-23i0t.html| title=Greenpeace activists in costly GM protest| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald| date=2012-08-02| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/gm-crop-destroyers-given-suspended-sentences-20121119-29l66.html| title=GM crop destroyers given suspended sentences| publisher=Canberra Times| date=2012-11-19| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack Greenpeace criticised CSIRO for a close relationship with industry that had led to an increase in [[genetically modified crops]], even though a core aim of CSIRO is Cooperative Research "working hand in hand with industry [to] build partnerships and engage with industry to generate impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Partner/Industry.aspx | title = Working hand in hand with industry | accessdate = 8 Nov 2013 | date = 22 April 2013 | work = CSIRO website | publisher = Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/en/mediacentre/media-releases/food/Greenpeace-calls-on-CSIRO-to-come-clean-on-commercial-relationships/ |title= Greenpeace calls on CSIRO to come clean on commercial relationships |date= 15 July 2011 |publisher= www.greenpeace.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change censorship: Clive Spash ===
On 25 November 2009, a debate was held in the Australian Senate concerning the alleged involvement of the CSIRO and the Labor government in censorship. The debate was called for by opposition parties after evidence came to light that a paper critical of carbon emissions trading was being suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-2-The-Australian-FRONT-PAGE.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 2 November 2009 |title= CSIRO bid to gag emissions trading scheme policy attack |work= The Australian |publisher= News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the Labor government was trying to get such a scheme through the Senate. After the debate, the Science Minister, Kim Carr, was forced to release the paper, but when doing so in the Senate he also delivered a letter from the CEO of the CSIRO, [[Megan Clark]], which attacked the report's author and threatened him with unspecified punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9_News_26_Nov_2009.pdf |author= Crystal, J. |date= 26 November 2009 |title= CSIRO scientist faces punishment |publisher= 9 News |location= Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of the paper, Clive Spash, was cited in the press as having been bullied and harassed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Climate expert Clive Spash 'heavied' by CSIRO management |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-3-The_Australian-Climate_expert_Clive_Spash_heavied_by_CSIRO_management.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 3 November 2009 |work= The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later gave a radio interview about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MW-CSIRO-121212.mp3 |author= Walsh, M. |year= 2012 |title= The toxic workplace and bullying culture at CSIRO |publisher= www.2cc.net.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the midst of the affair, CSIRO management had considered releasing the paper with edits that Nature reported would be "tiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091113/full/news.2009.1083.html |author= Pincock, S. |date=13 November 2009 |title= Australian agency moves to calm climate row. Researcher will be allowed to publish his paper after making 'tiny' changes. |journal= Nature |doi=10.1038/news.2009.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spash claimed the changes actually demanded amounted to censorship and resigned. He later posted on his website a document detailing the text that CSIRO management demanded be deleted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An Orwellian guide to carbon emissions trading |author= Spash, C. |year= 2010 |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OrwellianGuidetoCarbonETS.pdf |publisher= www.clivespash.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; by itself, this document forms a coherent set of statements criticising emissions trading without any additional wording needed. In subsequent Senate Estimates hearings during 2010, Senator Carr and Clark went on record claiming the paper was originally stopped from publication solely due to its low quality not meeting CSIRO standards.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Senate 2010. Senate Economics Legislation Committee Estimates. Canberra: Official Hansard (Wednesday, 10 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of its attempted suppression, the paper had been accepted for publication in an academic journal, [[New Political Economy (journal)|New Political Economy]], which in 2010 had been ranked by the Australian Research Council as an 'A class' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/era2010_journal_title_list.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119133137/http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/ERA2010_journal_title_list.xls |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ABC radio interview, Spash called for a Senate enquiry into the affair and the role played by senior management and the Science Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dumped Professor calls for Senate inquiry |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s2829301.htm |author= Colvin, M. |year= 2010 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After these events, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''  reported that "Questions are being raised about the closeness of BHP Billiton and the CSIRO under its chief executive, Megan Clark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.smh.com.au/business/csiro-in-bed-with-big-coal-20100702-zu2i.html |author= Manning, P. |year= 2010 |title= CSIRO in bed with big coal |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his resignation, an unedited version of the paper was released by Spash as a discussion paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/ |author= Spash, C.

===CSIRO–Novartis–DataTrace scandal===
On 11 April 2013, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' ran a story on how CSIRO had "duped" the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant [[Novartis]] into purchasing an anti-counterfeit technology for its vials of injectable [[Voltaren]]. The invention was marketed by a small Australian company called DataTrace DNA as a method of identifying fake vials, on the basis that a unique tracer code developed by CSIRO was embedded in the product. However, the code sold to Novartis for more than A$2M was apparently not unique, and was based on a "cheap tracer ... bought in bulk from a Chinese distributor". Novartis was contractually bound not to reverse-engineer the tracer to verify its uniqueness. The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' report alleges that this was done with the knowledge of key CSIRO personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the CSIRO cheated a global drugs giant |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-csiro-cheated-a-global-drugs-giant-20130410-2hluf.html |accessdate=12 April 2012 |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO has since conducted a full review of the allegations and found no evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Media/CSIRO-review-of-issues-raised-about-CSIROs-interactions-with-DataTrace.aspx |title=CSIRO review of issues raised about CSIRO’s interactions with DataTrace |publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |date=11 August 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged bullying, harassment and victimisation===
In recent years{{When|date=February 2017}} the CSIRO has fallen under the spotlight for allegedly exhibiting a culture of workplace bullying and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser and Nicky Phillips (12 April 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/science-second-in-toxic-csiro-work-culture-20130412-2hqv0.html "Science second in toxic CSIRO work culture"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former CSIRO employees started to surface with experiences of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (5 February 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/probe-into-csiro-bullying-20130205-2dwva.html "Probe into CSIRO bullying"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (18 September 2012) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/whistleblowers-at-csiro-forced-out-and-bullying-rife-20120917-262hk.html "Whistleblowers at CSIRO forced out and bullying rife"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; CSIRO took the allegations seriously and responded to the articles on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (14 April 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/More-than-85-years-growth-change-impact.aspx "More than 85 years of growth, change and impact"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (2 May 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Chief-Executive-Megan-Clarks-update-to-staff-re-Fairfax-articles.aspx "Chief Executive Megan Clark's update to staff re Fairfax articles"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, [[Sophie Mirabella]], wrote to the government requesting it establish an inquiry. Mirabella said she is aware of as many as 100 cases of alleged workplace harassment. On 20 July 2012 [[Comcare]] issued CSIRO with an Improvement Notice with regard to handling and management of workplace misconduct/code of conduct type investigations and allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130727093429/http://www.comcare.gov.au/about_us/access_to_information/disclosure_log/foi_requested_documents/improvement_notice_relating_to_eve207221 ]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2013 Mirabella advised the [[Australian House of Representatives]] that in relation to the worker's compensation claim for psychological injuries of ex-CSIRO employee, Martin Williams, which was vigorously defended by [[Comcare]] on the advice of the CSIRO, that CSIRO officers had provided false testimony on no less than 128 occasions under oath when the matter went before the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;''"I am also reminded of the government's stubborn unwillingness to bring the CSIRO to account for a series of inaccurate and misleading statements that have been made to the Senate estimates committees, including the recent incomprehensible answer to question AL156 which says that no CSIRO employee provided false evidence under oath during cross-examination in the AAT case involving Martin Williams, when an analysis of the transcript of that case suggests that there are at least 100, and more precisely around 128, separate instances of CSIRO officers providing false evidence in the case."''
Sophie Mirabella MP (shadow minister for innovation, industry, science research and tertiary education). Australian House of Representatives – House Debate Monday 24 June 2013 at 6:33pm. [http://www.openaustralia.org/debate/?id=2013-06-24.99.2 "Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2013; Second Reading"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirabella stated, "even in establishing the framework for this inquiry it is obvious there's an inappropriate 'hands on' approach by CSIRO."

In response to the allegations Clark commissioned Dennis Pearce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwlebsworth.com.au/expertise/intellectual-property-and-trade-marks/features/our-team/item/479-emeritus-professor-dennis-pearce-ao.html |title=Emeritus Prof. Dennis Pearce AO FAAL |website=Hwlebsworth.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is assisted by an investigation team from HWL Ebsworth Lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWL Ebsworth appointed to CSIRO bullying enquiry|url=http://asia.legalbusinessonline.com/news/hwl-ebsworth-appointed-to-csiro-bullying-enquiry/110241|work=Asian Legal Business|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct an independent investigation into allegations of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwlebsworth.com.au/csiro-investigation.html Independent Investigator for Allegations of Workplace Bullying and Other Unreasonable Behaviour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409032401/http://hwlebsworth.com.au/csiro-investigation.html |date=9 April 2013 }}, hwlebsworth.com.au&lt;br/&gt;
"Emeritus Professor Dennis Pearce AO has been appointed as the independent investigator for allegations of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members and CSIRO affiliates."&lt;/ref&gt;  Mirabella continued to question the independence of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sophie Mirabella]] MP, (26 February 2013), [http://www.sophiemirabella.com.au/Media/PortfolioMedia/MediaReleases/tabid/78/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/708/CSIRO-BULLYING-TERMS-OF-REFERENCE-LEAVES-QUESTIONS-UNANSWERED.aspx "CSIRO bullying terms of reference leaves questions unanswered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105083222/http://www.sophiemirabella.com.au/Media/PortfolioMedia/MediaReleases/tabid/78/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/708/CSIRO-BULLYING-TERMS-OF-REFERENCE-LEAVES-QUESTIONS-UNANSWERED.aspx# |date=5 January 2017 }}, Portfolio News&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the investigation is scheduled to publish its findings at the end of July 2013, and the final stage is scheduled to be complete by February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''"The investigator will provide his Phase 1 reports by 31 July 2013. It is likely that people will be told the outcome of the investigator's consideration of their submission at about this time. It is intended that Phase 2 will be completed by February 2014."''

===CSIRO and the Liberal Government===
In August 2015 the CSIRO discontinued its annual July and August survey, conducted over the previous five years, polling to create a long-term view of how Australians viewed global warming and their support for action.  In the previous 2013 poll, 86 per cent agreed with the statement that climate change was occurring and only 7.6 per cent disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-change-csiro-axes-annual-attitudes-survey-delays-2014-results-20150810-giw6i1.html |title=Climate change: CSIRO axes annual attitudes survey, delays 2014 results |website=Smh.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 11th February 2016, Dr Larry Marshall – a former venture capitalist with Southern Cross Venture Holdings, who had been appointed CEO of the CSIRO on the 1st January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/Leadership-governance/Chief-Executive-and-Executive-Team/Team |title=Executive Team - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2015-07-16 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused an international outcry after describing Australia’s national climate change discussion as “more like religion than science,” a week after announcing hundreds of job cuts to the organisation that will reduce the effectiveness of its climate research team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/climate-politics-more-like-religion-says-csiro-boss-90059 |title=Climate politics 'more like religion', says CSIRO boss |publisher=Renew Economy |date=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “an open letter to the Australian Government and CSIRO”, 2,800 of the leading climate scientists from 60 countries say the announcement of cuts to the CSIRO’s Oceans and Atmosphere research program has alarmed the global climate research community.  They say the decision shows a lack of insight and a misunderstanding of the importance of the depth and significance of Australian contributions to global and regional climate research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worlds-top-scientists-beg-malcolm-turnbull-to-allow-csiro-to-continue-its-climate-research-2016-2 |title=The world's top scientists beg Malcolm Turnbull to allow CSIRO to continue its climate research |website=Businessinsider.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claudio Di Veroli''' (born 1946) is an Italian-Argentinian [[harpsichordist]] who has written several books and papers on baroque performance practice. Born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, he was raised in an Italian family  and attended Italian primary and secondary school. He studied privately in Buenos Aires under [[:de:Ernesto Epstein|Ernesto Epstein]] (piano and interpretation), [[:de:Erwin Leuchter|Erwin Leuchter]] (harmony) and [[Ljerko Spiller]] (chamber music), obtained a degree in Mathematics from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and a PhD in Statistics from [[Imperial College]], London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=J. Claudio Di Veroli|url=https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=142140|accessdate=April 2, 2018|newspaper=Mathematics Genealogy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; , under the supervision of Prof. Sir [[David Cox (statistician)]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Optimal Continuous Policies for Repair and Replacement|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324388029_Optimal_Continuous_Policies_for_Repair_and_Replacement|accessdate=May 1, 2018|journal=Operational Research Quarterly, UK|date=March 1, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Living in Europe in the early 70's he studied harpsichord with [[Colin Tilney]] in London and [[:fr:Hubert Bédard|Hubert Bédard]] in Paris.

He then returned to Buenos Aires, where he pioneered the performance of Baroque music based on ancient practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juarez|first=Miguel|title=Instrumentos originales en la Argentina|journal=CLASICA|date=January 1994|volume=3|issue=1|page=55|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Professor of Harpsichord and examiner of the Organ course at the [[Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Musica (Argentina)|Conservatorio Nacional]] in Buenos Aires.  As a soloist he has performed extensively in concert halls, churches and television, both solo and with ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Di Veroli|first1=Claudio|title=List of Public Performances|url=http://harps.braybaroque.ie/recitals.htm|website=Bray Baroque|location=Bray, Rep.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18185">'''Clinical geropsychology''' is broadly defined as the application of "the knowledge and methods of [[psychology]] to understanding and helping older persons and their families to maintain well-being, overcome problems and achieve maximum potential during later life" (Source: [http://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/gero.aspx APA]).

== Background and definition ==

The population of the world is aging at a rapid rate.  The [[Administration on Aging]] reports that people age 65 and older constituted about 13% of the US population in 2009, and these numbers are expected to grow exponentially.  For the first time in human history, the world has more individuals age 65 and older than those age 5 years old and under. By 2030, there will be an estimated 72.1 million older adults in the US, constituting approximately 19% of the population. Given the expected growth of the older adult population, psychologists with specialty training in geropsychology are in demand.

Clinical geropsychologists are trained to address a variety of challenges common in later life. Older adults often experience a multitude of unique changes in later life, including declines in health, loss of loved ones, retirement, changes in residence, loss of independence, and others. Geropsychologists have specialized training to address problems such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[neurocognitive]] disorders (e.g., [[dementia]], [[mild cognitive impairment]] [MCI]) caused by problems such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], caregiver stress, [[grief]] and [[Grief|bereavement]], [[end-of-life care]] issues, and physical health problems (e.g., [[sleep disorders]], [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]). They are also sensitive to multicultural issues of aging in clinical practice, research, and policy ([[gerodiversity]]). 

Clinical geropsychologists provide psychological assessment and intervention to older adults and their families, as well as consultation services to other health care professionals. These psychological services are provided in a variety of settings and contexts, including private practice, community mental health, integrated medical settings (e.g., primary care), rehabilitation care, inpatient psychiatric settings, residential care, long-term care, adult day health programs, and many other settings. Clinical geropsychologists are also trained to work in universities, academic hospitals and medical settings, research institutes, and public policy settings.

== Early history ==

In 1946, Sydney Pressey, PhD., and a coalition of supporters helped establish the Adult Development and Aging Division of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) devoted to the study of older adults and adult development (Birren &amp; Morrow, 1996). The APA approved the Adult Development and Aging Division with a vote of 20 to 3, thus establishing it as the first aging-related expansion of the APA (Birren &amp; Morrow, 1996).

In 1946, the first meeting of the Adult Development and Aging Division was held with 13 people in attendance.  Despite its modest beginnings, by 1952, the annual meeting of the Adult Development and Aging Division was held jointly with the Gerontological Society in Washington, D.C.  At this meeting, Harold Jones, a lifespan psychologist and director of the California-based Institute of Child Welfare, addressed the conference and argued for the establishment of "A national institute on the problems of aging." Though it would be another 22 years before the [[National Institute of Aging]] (NIA) was established, in only six years, the Adult Development and Aging Division was able to establish its agenda as a national concern warranting increased government attention (Birren &amp; Morrow, 1996).

In a 1953 meeting of The Adult Development and Aging Division, Nathan Shock, PhD., the founder of one of the first longitudinal studies on aging, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study, asked the psychologists present to consider "practical" issues of maturity and old age. This was the first known reference to a more applied and clinical approach to a psychology of aging outside of the medical field (Birren &amp; Morrow, 1996).

In 1959, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) established a section devoted to aging, and appointed James Emmett Birren, PhD, as chief of this division.  Birren's research focused on neurological, sensory, perceptual and cognitive functions in aging, and he is often considered the first modern experimental aging researcher (Birren &amp; Morrow, 1996). As the chief of the section on aging at NIMH, he was instrumental as an organizer and promoter of the field. He developed and edited the Handbook of Psychology of Aging, became the editor-in-chief of the Journal Gerontology, and eventually went on to become the president of the Gerontological Society of America (Birren &amp; Morrow, 1996).

In 1971, a White House Conference on Aging found that the education and training of health professionals in older adults was urgently warranted (Storandt, 1982). The conference recommended the creation of an aging institute, and in 1971 The Research on Aging Act was introduced. In 1974, The Research on Aging Act passed in Congress, and President Nixon signed the bill thus creating the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA) (Binstock, 2010).  This was a pivotal moment in the emergence of clinical geropsychology as a distinct field of practice.

== History of Medicare's reimbursement of geropsychology services ==

Providing psychology services to older adults was historically curtailed by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'s  limited coverage of mental health services. Barriers specific to psychological services were caused by Medicare's provider restrictions, which did not allow reimbursement to psychologists until 1988.  In addition, prior to 1988, Medicare capped reimbursement for all mental health outpatient services at $250 annually.  The annual cap on outpatient mental health care was increased in 1988 and 1989, and then eliminated in 1990.

An additional discriminatory practice that resulted in barriers to mental health care for older adults was the Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation, which established a 50% coinsurance for outpatient mental health treatment.  This 50% coinsurance applied to outpatient treatment services, not to psychodiagnostic services, inpatient services, or psychological and neuropsychological assessment services.  Passage of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required a phased out elimination of the Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation.  Since January 1, 2014, Medicare's coinsurance for outpatient mental health treatment is 20%, consistent with other outpatient services (Medicare Learning Network Matters®) (2013, January 18).

Current Medicare coverage policies for mental health care are available from several resources including Medicare Learning Network Matters® (2012, March) and Norris (in press).

While past reimbursement barriers for geropsychologists in the traditional Medicare plans have been largely amended, geropsychologists' services are often disallowed by the limited in-network policies of Medicare Part C plans.  An increasing number of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolling in Medicare Part C (also known as Medicare Advantage Plans), growing to over 13 million enrollees in 2013.

Unlike the fee-for-service Medicare Part A and B plans, Medicare Part C plans have restricted networks that limit access to providers.

== Clinical training and national conferences ==

As the first president of the [[National Institute of Aging]], Robert Butler, MD, made his first mission to enhance the education and training of health professionals in the field of aging. From 1975 to 1976, the Adult Development and Aging Division conducted a survey of graduate training programs in psychology that revealed only two psychology programs had a geriatrics track (M. Storandt, personal communication, April 4, 2010). Recognizing the dearth of training opportunities for geriatric clinicians and researchers, the Adult Development and Aging Division proposed to establish a task force on training in the psychology of aging. This recommendation was referred to the board of education and training, which fully endorsed the proposal. With support from the APA and funding from the NIA, the Adult Development and Aging Division assembled a task force in November 1977 to "assess the psychological needs of older adults and provide recommendations concerning the involvement of psychologists in mental health services to the older populations." (Storandt, 1982) This set the stage for the first of three monumental conferences on clinical geropsychology: the 1981 conference on Training Psychologists for Work in Aging, known as the "Older Boulder" conference, held in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado (in contrast to the "Boulder" conference of 1949 at which standards were made for the training of PhD clinical psychologists in general [i.e., the "[[Boulder model]]"]. At this conference, psychologists began discussing the knowledge base of geropsychology and how this information could be taught to new geropsychologists.  The goal of Older Boulder was "to identify the resources we can use to develop and expand training in aging for psychologists… [and to] develop a set of policy recommendations." Older Boulder's organizers stressed the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to aging training, and thus, they encouraged general psychologists, geropsychologists, non-psychology gerontologists, consumers and students to attend the conference.  In total, nearly 100 people participated in the conference (Storandt, 1982).

The results of the Older Boulder conference were the publication of Psychology and the Older Adult: Challenges for Training in the 1980s (Santos &amp; Vandenbos, 1982), as well as a full report from the conference and many position papers on various topics. Most importantly, Older Boulder was a key first step to creating a training model for geriatric competencies for psychologists.

The second national conference, "Older Boulder II", was held in Washington DC in 1992.  At this conference, a greater focus was placed on skills training as well as the multiple levels of clinical training.
  
The third national conference was held in 2006 in [[Colorado Springs]], Colorado.  At this conference, a model of training was established for clinical geropsychologists: the Pikes Peak model (Knight et al., 2009). The Pikes Peak model coalesced the information already known about older adults and applied it to the establishment of competency areas for the training of clinical geropsychologists. For example, the model highlighted the need for training programs to educate students to differentiate between healthy and pathological aging, normative changes associated with later life, cohort effects, general knowledge about adult development, and various care settings for older adults, especially interdisciplinary care (Knight et al., 2009). Emphasis was also placed on the unique ethical and legal issues associated with working with older adults, as well as distinct age-related diversity and cultural issues.   The [http://copgtp.org/uploads/documents/Pikes_Peak_Evaluation_Tool.pdf Pikes Peak Geropsychology Knowledge and Skill Assessment tool]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} provides a broad overview of competency areas needed for professional practice in geropsychology.

== Society of Clinical Geropsychology (American Psychological Association Division 12, Section II) ==

In 1993, the American Psychological Association organized a subsection that would eventually be titled the Section on Clinical Geropsychology (sometimes referred to as APA Division 12, Section II).  This was done at the initiative of a steering committee composed of several psychologists, including George Niederehe, Barry Edelstein, Dolores Gallagher-Thompson, Margaret Gatz, Alfred Kaszniak, Norm Abels, Michael A. Smyer, George Stricker, and Linda Teri (Routh, 1994).  The steering committee pursued the establishment of the designated subsection of APA Division 12, Section II. This subsection is closely linked to APA's Adult Development and Aging Division.  The Society's mission is fostering the mental health and wellness of older adults through science, practice, education and advocacy and by advancing the field of professional geropsychology.  The name "Section of Clinical Geropsychology" was changed to "Society of Clinical Geropsychology" in 2008. The Society is active in promoting and supporting training in geropsychology at the doctoral, internship, and post-doctoral level, advocating for geropsychology in public policy, and promoting aging research that informs clinical practice. The Society publishes a newsletter three times per year.  More information about the Society, including a listing of its current executive committee, can be found at the organization's [http://geropsychology.org website]. The Society offers several awards to members annually: M. Powell Lawton Award for Distinguished Contributions to Clinical Geropsychology, Clinical Mentorship Award, and Student Research Award.

== Recognition of specialty area ==

Professional geropsychology was acknowledged as a proficiency area by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1997, and was recognized as a specialty area by APA in 2010. Additionally, in 2013, geropsychology was established as an emerging specialty area by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]], allowing psychologists to attain board certification in geropsychology.

'''Comprehensive planning''' is a process that determines community goals and aspirations in terms of community development. The result is called a comprehensive plan and both expresses and regulates public policies on transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. Comprehensive plans typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The term comprehensive planning is most often used by [[urban planners]] in the United States.

In Canada, comprehensive planning is generally known as strategic planning or visioning. It is usually accompanied by public consultation. When cities and municipalities engage in comprehensive planning the resulting document is known as an [[Official Community Plan]] or OCP for short. (In Alberta, the resultant document is referred to as a Municipal Development Plan.

== History ==
During the earliest times of American history, cities had little power given to them by State governments to control land use. After the [[American Revolution]], the focus on property rights turned to self-rule and personal freedom, as this was a time of very strong personal property rights. Local governments had simple powers which included maintaining law and order and providing basic services. Cities had little power, if any at all, to direct development in the city.

Cities began to focus on the provision of basic services during the 1840s at a time known as the [[Sanitary Reform Movement]]. During this time it became clear that there was a strong relationship between disease and the availability of a quality sewer system. Part of the movement included the development of sanitary survey planning to help bring sewer systems to infected parts of cities. From this planning also developed a new consciousness of townsite location. People began to understand the environmental and social impacts of building cities and developed ways in which to further lower the spread of deadly diseases. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] was a firm believer in the relationship between the physical environment and sanitation, which helped lead to the development of grand parks and open spaces in communities to bring not only recreation, but sanitation as well. The Sanitary Reform Movement is seen by many as the first attempt at comprehensive planning, however it failed to be completely comprehensive because it focused on only one aspect of the city and did not consider the city as a whole.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities began to urbanize at very high rates. Cities became very dense and full of disease. As a response to the overpopulation and chaotic conditions, planning became a major focus of many large American cities. The [[City Beautiful movement]] was one of the many responses to the decaying city. The movement began in Chicago in 1890 with the [[World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] and lasted until about the 1920s. The focus on the movement was the design and architectural characteristics of the city. Leaders of the movement wanted to push the vision of the ideal city, and demonstrate to the world what cities could look like if they were created to be works of art. The White City was created for the exposition which embodied the visions of the movement with neoclassical designed buildings set against landscaped streets. Visitors to the exhibition began to realize that cities could be much more than dirty, overcrowded places. The movement spread across the United States and influenced many major American cities.

In 1898, [[Ebenezer Howard]] published his book entitled "Tomorrow, a Peaceful Path to Reform," in which he developed the idea of a [[garden city movement|Garden City]]. This city was a planned development which included different land uses and community services. The communities were to be surrounded by a [[green belt]] and included many open spaces and parks within the city. These cities were designed to be completely self-sufficient and focused on decreasing the negative impacts traditional cities had on people's lives. Although these cities were considered to be utopian ideas, two cities were eventually built in this vision, [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]], England. The vision of Ebenezer Howard greatly impacted the idea of city planning in the United States for decades and helped in the development of the idea that cities must be planning comprehensively for growth.

After the turn of the twentieth century, American cities began to see the need for local development and growth plans. Influential in this planning was [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]] who re-created the city plan for [[Washington, D.C.]] created by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] in 1791. The original plan called for grid iron laid streets crossed by diagonal boulevards, squares, plazas, parks, monuments, and sculptures. However, over time this plan was largely ignored and the city had developed against L'Enfant's vision. Burnham was instrumental in recreating the city plan and helping to return the city to its once intended form. In 1903, Burnham helped create the city growth plan for the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and in 1906 he created the city plan for [[San Francisco, California]]. Although these were all city development plans, it was not until 1909 when Burnham created the city plan for Chicago that his plans were comprehensive. [[Burnham Plan|The plan of Chicago]] is known today as the first comprehensive plan and it began a movement of comprehensive planning that emphasized planning as a way to not only make cities more beautiful, but to function better as well.

== Comprehensive planning process ==
Comprehensive Planning typically follows a planning process that consists of eight different steps. By following this process, planners are able to determine a wide range of interconnecting issues that affect an urban area. Each step can be seen as interdependent and many times planners will revise the order to best fit their needs.

===Identifying issues===
The planner must first address the issue they are investigating. "To be relevant, the planning process must identify and address not only contemporary issues of concern to residents, workers, property owners, and business people, but also the emerging issues that will be important in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Larz. (1995) ''Guidelines for Preparing Urban Plans'' Chicago: APA Planners Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, planners determine community issues by involving various community leaders, community organizations, and ordinary citizens.

===Stating goals===
Once issues have been identified by a community, goals can then be established. Goals are community visions. They establish priorities for communities and help community leaders make future decisions which will affect the city. Stating goals is not always an easy process and it requires the active participation of all people in the community.

===Collecting data===
Data is needed in the planning process in order to evaluate current city conditions as well as to predict future conditions. Data is most easily collected from the [[United States Census Bureau]], however many communities actively collect their own data. The most typical data collected for a comprehensive plan include data about the environment, traffic conditions, economic conditions, social conditions (such as population and income), public services and utilities, and land use conditions (such as housing and zoning). Once this data is collected it is analyzed and studied. Outcomes of the data collection process include population projections, economic condition forecasts, and future housing needs.

===Preparing the plan===
The plan is prepared using the information gathered during the data collection and goal setting stages. A typical comprehensive plan begins by giving a brief background of the current and future conditions found in the data collection step. Following the background information are the community goals and the plans that will be used in order to implement those goals into the community. Plans may also contain separate sections for important issues such as transportation or housing which follow the same standard format.
&lt;ref&gt;↔&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating implementation plans===
During this stage of the process different programs are thought of in order to implement the goals of the plan. These plans focus on issues such as cost and effectiveness. It is possible that a variety of plans will result from this process in order to realize one goal. These different plans are known as alternatives.

===Evaluating alternatives===
Each alternative should be evaluated by community leaders to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective way to realize the community's goals. During this stage each alternative should be weighed given its potential positive and negative effects, impacts on the community, and impacts on the city government. One alternative should be chosen that best meets the needs and desires of the community and community leaders for meeting the community goals.

===Adopting a plan===
The community needs to adopt the plan as an official statement of policy in order for it to take effect. This is usually done by the City Council and through public hearings. The [[City Council]] may choose not to adopt the plan, which would require planners to refine the work they did during previous steps. Once the plan is accepted by city officials it is then a legal statement of community policy in regards to future development.

===Implementing and monitoring the plan===
Using the implementation plans defined in the earlier stages, the city will carry out the goals in the comprehensive plan. City planning staff monitor the outcomes of the plan and may propose future changes if the results are not desired.

A comprehensive plan is not a permanent document. It can be changed and rewritten over time. For many fast growing communities, it is necessary to revise or update the comprehensive plan every five to ten years. In order for the comprehensive plan to be relevant to the community it must remain current.

== Legal basis ==
The basis for comprehensive planning comes from the government's duty and right to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.  The power for local governments to plan generally comes from state planning enabling legislation; however, local governments in most states are not required by law to engage in comprehensive planning. State statutes usually provide the legal framework necessary for those communities choosing to participate while allowing others to disengage themselves with the process. The legal provision for comprehensive planning comes from what is called the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act]] which was written by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] in the 1920s. This act was never passed by the [[United States Congress]] but was rather a law written for state legislatures to willingly adopt. Many states did choose to adopt the act which provided local governments with the framework to engage in land use planning. Because the act never gave a clear definition for comprehensive planning, the Department of Commerce wrote another act, the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1928, which defined more precisely what a comprehensive plan is and how it should be used.

In states that do not require local governments to plan comprehensively, state governments usually provide many incentives to encourage the process at the local level. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for example, the state government gives many incentives to local governments to establish comprehensive plans to guide development. Today, almost every county in Georgia has established a plan voluntarily.

However, a comprehensive plan is not usually legally binding.  A community's ordinances must be amended in order to legally implement the provisions required to execute the comprehensive plan.

The '''Deaf rights movement''' encompasses a series of [[social movements]] within the [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] and [[Cultural diversity|cultural diversity movements]] that encourages [[Deaf|deaf and hard of hearing]] to push society to adopt a position of equal respect for them. Acknowledging that those who were hearing impaired had rights to obtain the same things as those with no hearing impairments lead this movement. Establishing an educational system to teach those with hearing impairments was one of the first accomplishments of this movement. Sign language, as well as cochlear implants, has also had an extensive impact on the Deaf community. These have all been aspects that have paved the way for those with hearing impairments, which began with the Deaf Rights movement.  
== Deaf education ==
{{main article|Deaf education}}

===Oralism===
{{main article|Oralism}}
Oralism focuses on teaching deaf students through oral communicative means rather than sign languages.

There is strong opposition within Deaf communities to the [[Oralism|oralist]] method of teaching deaf children to speak and [[Lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of [[sign language]] in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of [[sign language]] is also central to Deaf [[Cultural identity|identity]] and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.

=== Deaf schools ===
Parents of deaf children also have to opportunity to send their children to deaf schools, where the curriculum is taught in [[American Sign Language]]. The first school for the education of deaf individuals was the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons, which opened on April 15, 1817.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was a coeducation insitiution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/dhm/edu/essay.html?id=38|title=Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb|last=Crowley|first=John|website=www.disabilitymuseum.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school was later renamed the [[American School for the Deaf]], and was granted federal money to set up of deaf institutions around the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many teachers in these schools were women, because according to PBS and the research done for the film ''Through Deaf Eyes'', they were  better at instructing due to the patience it took to do something repetitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/women.html|title=Oral Education and Women in the Classroom|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American School for the Deaf was set up based on a British model of education for deaf individuals with instruction in the subjects of reading, writing, history, math, and an advanced study of the Bible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gallaudet University]] is the only deaf university in the world, which instructs in American Sign Language, and promotes research and publications for the deaf community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/|title = Gallaudet University|website = www2.gallaudet.edu|access-date = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University is responsible for expanding services and education for deaf individuals in developing countries around the world, as well as in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviewing The Pioneering Roles Of Gallaudet University Alumni In Advancing Deaf Education And Services In Developing Countries: Insights And Challenges From Nigeria." ''American Annals Of The Deaf'' 2 (2015): 75. ''Project MUSE''. Web. 15 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many deaf individuals choose to be educated in a deaf environment for their college level education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Deaf President Now ===
{{main article|Deaf President Now}}

[[I. King Jordan]] had made history in 1988 for becoming the first deaf president of [[Gallaudet University]] after the protest, ''Deaf President Now'' Students, with the support of from many alumni, faculty, staff and friends, protested the Board of Trustees' continued appointments of  hearing presidents over highly qualified deaf candidates in an institution established to serve the deaf.

=== Historical figures===
{{Main articles|List of deaf people}}
There have been many individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community. These individuals have been both deaf or hearing. A few of the most recognizable names include:
[[Alexander Graham Bell]], who is known for the invention of the telephone but to the Deaf, is seen as a villain of sorts; 
[[Heather Whitestone]], the first deaf Miss-America; 
[[Marlee Matlin]], a well known deaf actress;
[[Laurent Clerc]], a well-known deaf professor; and 
[[Helen Keller]], the most commonly known deaf-blind woman.

However, this is only a small number of individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community.

== Public accommodations ==
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], also known as the ADA, has made a huge impact on the deaf community. In 1990 it was a landmark for people with disabilities. The ADA has been a great benefit for hard of hearing and deaf people to help them gain every aspect of life that a hearing person has. The ADA took the important principles in these laws and extended them to the broad mainstream of Americans public life. It prohibits discrimination in almost every aspect of society.(26)  Meaning you would have a legitimate reason to not hire someone with a disability.  The legislation provides legal protection in employment(Title I), access to state and local government and public transportation (title II), public accommodations (Title III)(they have to provide a translator), and telecommunications (title IV). (26) George H W Bush signed this into act, and there was no acclaimed retaliation from this. It didn’t solve the problem of discrimination but it gave those who had a disability protection.

In 1975 Congress found that more than eight million children were not receiving equal education. There was another bill passed to help solve this problem called the Individual with Disabilities Act (IDEA). The IDEA was made to "ensure that all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate, public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their needs and prepare them for employment and independent living. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents are protected. To assist states, localities, educational service agencies, and federal agencies to pay for education for all children with disabilities. And finally to assess and ensure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities." (73)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National, A. O. T. D. (2015). Legal Rights, 6th Ed. : The Guide for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People. Washington, DC, US: Gallaudet University Press.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaf culture movement ==
{{main article|Deaf culture}}

Deaf culture is a culture defined by usage of sign language and many cultural and social norms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Cochlear implants===
Within the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]], there is strong opposition to the use of [[cochlear implants]] and sometimes also [[hearing aids]] and similar technologies. This is often justified in terms of a rejection of the view that [[deafness]], as a condition, is something that needs to be ''fixed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=Bonnie Poitras|title=Deaf Culture, Cochlear Implants, and Elective Disability|journal=Hastings Center Report|date=8 July 1998|volume=28|issue=4|pages=6-14|doi=10.2307/3528607|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3528607|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that this technology also threatens the continued existence of Deaf culture, but Kathryn Woodcock argues that it is a greater threat to [[Deaf culture]] ''to reject prospective members just because they used to hear, because their parents chose an implant for them, because they find environmental sound useful, etc''.&lt;ref name="woodcock1992"&gt;{{cite book | first=Kathryn | last=Woodcock | year=1992 | title=Cochlear Implants vs. Deaf Culture? In Mervin Garretson (ed.), ''Viewpoints on Deafness: A Deaf American Monograph''. Silver Spring, MD: National Association for the Deaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochlear implants may improve the perception of sound for suitable implantees, but they do not reverse [[deafness]], or create a normal perception of sounds. The Deaf community still insists that a child not be fitted with a cochlear implant until old enough to decide for themselves because the affects are irreversible and could cause a lifetime of pain, regret, and hatred/isolation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">'''Dipole field strength in free space''', in [[telecommunications]], is the [[electric field strength]] caused by a half wave [[dipole]] under ideal conditions. The actual field strength in terrestrial environments is calculated by empirical formulas based on this field strength.

== Power density ==


Let '''N''' be the effective power radiated from an isotropic antenna and '''p''' be the power density at a distance '''d''' from this source&lt;ref&gt;''Reference data for radio Engineers'', Howard W.Sams co,Indianapolis, 1956, 27-7&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{p} = \frac{N}{4\cdot \pi \cdot d^2}&lt;/math&gt; 

Power density is also defined in terms of electrical field strength;

Let '''E''' be the electrical field and '''R''' be the impedance of the free space

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{p} = \frac{E^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

The following relation is obtained by equating the two,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{4\cdot \pi \cdot d^2}= \frac{E^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

or by rearranging the terms

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{E} =\frac{\sqrt{N} \cdot\sqrt{R}}{2\cdot \sqrt{\pi}\cdot d}&lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical values ==
[[Impedance of free space]] is roughly &lt;math&gt; 120 \cdot \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Since a [[half wave dipole]] is used, its [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] over an [[isotropic]] [[dipole antenna|antenna]] (&lt;math&gt;\mbox{2.15 dBi} = 1.64&lt;/math&gt; ) should also be taken into consideration,

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{E} =\frac{\sqrt{1.64 \cdot N} \cdot  \sqrt{ 120\cdot \pi}}{2\cdot \sqrt{\pi}\cdot d} 

 \approx 7\cdot\frac{ \sqrt{N}}{d}&lt;/math&gt; 

In this equation [[SI units]] are used.

Expressing the same equation in:
: '''kW''' instead of '''W''' in [[power (physics)|power]], 
:'''km''' instead of '''m''' in [[distance]] and 
:'''mV/m''' instead of '''V/m''' in [[electric field]] 

is equivalent to multiplying the expression on the right by &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{1000}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt; K.H.Kaltbeitzer: ''Site selection'', EBU Techhnical Monograph 3104,Bruxelles,1965, p  30 &lt;/ref&gt; In this case,

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{E} \approx 222\cdot\frac{\sqrt{N}}{d} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;/div&gt;

'''The Documentation Centre for Music''' (DOMUS), at the [[Stellenbosch University Music Library]], has its origins in the work and interests of staff and students at the Department of Music at [[Stellenbosch University]].  These include, at various times, academic staff members and Music library staff.  The existence of this Centre on a more formal basis is due to the efforts of [[Prof. Stephanus Muller]], and funding provided by the Stellenbosch University Music Department and the Vice-rector Research at Stellenbosch University.  In August 2005 an [[archivist]] Santie de Jong was appointed to sort and maintain the archive's various collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Jong|first=Santie|year=2015|title=Armed with a light bulb at the end of a chord: The ten-year journey of DOMUS|url=|journal=Fontes Artis Musicae|volume=62:3|pages=212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aims of DOMUS'''
&lt;br /&gt;
DOMUS aims to collect, conserve/preserve, sort, and catalogue, for the benefit of research on [[postgraduate]] level, the literary estates of [[composer]]s, [[performer]]s and [[musicologist]]s, as well as documentation collections of music institutions. Moreover, DOMUS aims to produce "strategic projects" such as recordings, publications and exhibitions "to maintain the expressive cultures represented in these collections as an important part of a broad South African heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domus.ac.za/content/view/13/27/|title=www.domus.ac.za {{!}} Vision {{!}} Music, South, Collections, Africa, Research|last=Administrator|website=www.domus.ac.za|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doubletime''' ('''dbt''') also known as '''discs overgrown''' ('''dco''') is a [[gene]] that encodes the double-time [[protein]] (DBT) in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. The double-time protein is a [[kinase]] that phosphorylates [[period (gene)|PER]] protein that regulates the molecularly-driven, biological clock controlling [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref name = "k2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yu W, Zheng H, Price JL, Hardin PE | title = DOUBLETIME plays a noncatalytic role to mediate CLOCK phosphorylation and repress CLOCK-dependent transcription within the Drosophila circadian clock | journal = Mol.

Different [[mutation]]s in the ''dbt'' gene have been shown to cause lengthening, shortening, or complete loss in period of locomotor activity in flies. Drosophila and certain vertebrate [[Casein kinase i|Casein Kinase Id]] shows circadian function that has been evolutionary conserved over long time spans.&lt;ref name = "kP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fan JY, Preuss F, Muskus MJ, Bjes ES, Price JL | title = Drosophila and vertebrate casein kinase Idelta exhibits evolutionary conservation of circadian function | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 139–52 |date=January 2009 | pmid = 18957703 | pmc = 2621163 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.094805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

Double time gene (''dbt'') was first identified and characterized in 1998 by Michael Young and his team at [[The Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref name = "k1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/MichaelYoung/ | title =  Michael W. Young  | publisher = The Rockefeller University | work = Scientists &amp; Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young’s research group, headed by [http://sbs.umkc.edu/facultydetail.cfm?Faculty_ID=124 Jeffrey Price], published their results in a paper which characterized three [[alleles]] of ''dbt'' in fruit flies.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; They discovered that two mutant alleles, named short and long (''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) that were able to alter normal cycling of ''per'' and ''tim''.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; Young’s team suspected that the delay between the rise in mRNA levels of ''[[period (gene)|per]]'' and ''[[timeless (gene)|tim]]'' and the rise of PER and TIM protein were due to the effects of another protein. Young suspected that this protein postponed the intercellular accumulation of PER protein by destroying it. Only when PER was paired with TIM was this break-down not possible. This work showed that DBT regulated the break-down of PER.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt;

Young named the novel gene double-time (''dbt'') due to its effect on the normal period of Drosophila. Mutant flies which only expressed ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; had an 18-hour period while those expressing ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' had a 28-hour period.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; In addition, Young’s team isolated a third allele, ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;' which caused lethality in pupa while [[Ablation|ablating]] any ''per'' or ''tim'' products in larvae.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt;  ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; mutants were important because they provided clues as to how the gene product functioned.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt; Without functional DBT protein, flies accumulated high levels of PER and these PER proteins do not disintegrate in the absence of pairing with TIM protein. These mutants expressed higher cytosolic levels of PER than cells in which PER protein was associated with TIM protein.   The double-time gene regulates the expression of PER which in turns controls circadian rhythm.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt; Young’s team later [[cloned]] the dbt gene and found that the DBT protein was a [[kinase]] which specifically [[phosphorylated]] PER proteins. Thus, in dbt mutants, PER proteins were not phosphorylated by DBT protein.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt;

== Gene ==

The gene is located on the right arm of chromosome 3.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; The mRNA transcript of ''dbt'' is 3.2 kilo-base pairs long, and it contains four [[exons]] and three [[introns]].

== Protein ==

The DBT protein is composed of 440 [[amino acids]].&lt;ref name=Brody /&gt; The protein has an [[ATP-binding motif|ATP binding site]], a serine/threoine kinase catalytic domains, and several potential [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylation sites]], including a site for [[autophosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=Brody /&gt;

== Function ==

=== Regulation of circadian rhythm ===

In Drosophila, a molecularly-driven clock mechanism works to regulate circadian rhythms such as locomotor activity and [[eclosion]] by oscillating the levels of the proteins [[Period (gene)|PER]] and [[Timeless (gene)|TIM]] via [[Positive feedback|positive]] and [[Negative feedback|negative feedback loops]].&lt;ref name="Double-Time1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Price JL, Blau J, Rothenfluh A, Abodeely M, Kloss B, Young MW | title = double-time is a novel Drosophila clock gene that regulates PERIOD protein accumulation | journal = Cell | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–95 |date=July 1998 | pmid = 9674430 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81224-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drosophila DBT"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muskus MJ, Preuss F, Fan JY, Bjes ES, Price JL | title = Drosophila DBT lacking protein kinase activity produces long-period and arrhythmic circadian behavioral and molecular rhythms | journal = Mol.

Only once TIM accumulates do PER and TIM bind, and this binding inhibits the degradation of PER. This cytoplasmic PER degradation and then accumulation causes the 4-6 hour delay seen between the levels of per mRNA and the levels of PER protein.&lt;ref name="Kloss" /&gt; The PER/TIM complex, still bound to DBT, migrates into the nucleus where it suppresses the transcription of per and tim. TIM is lost from the complex, and DBT then phosphorylates PER which leads to its degradation, allowing for the transcription of the clock and clock-controlled genes (those with transcription controlled by circadian mechanisms).&lt;ref name="Kloss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-470-09082-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Goode J, Chadwick D | title = Molecular clocks and light signalling | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 269–270 | isbn = 0-470-09082-0 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oscillations in the PER and TIM proteins presence causes [[oscillations]] in their own and other genes' expression, which is the basis for circadian rhythmicity.&lt;ref name="Drosophila DBT" /&gt;

The transcription of ''dbt'' mRNA and the levels of the DBT protein are consistent throughout the day and not controlled by PER/TIM levels. However, the location and concentration of DBT protein within the cell changes throughout the day.&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite web | author = Brody T |title=Discs Overgrown: Regulation|url=http://www.sdbonline.org/fly/neural/doubltm4.htm|publisher=The Interactive Fly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is consistently present in the nucleus at varying levels, but in the cytoplasm it is predominantly present in the late day and early night, when PER and TIM levels are peaking&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

Before DBT begins phosphorylating PER, a different protein called NEMO/NLK kinase begins phosphorylating PER at its per-short domain. This phosphorylation stimulates DBT to begin phosphorylating PER at multiple nearby sites. In total, there are about 25-30 phosphorylation sites on PER.&lt;ref name="NEMO"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiu JC, Ko HW, Edery I | title = NEMO/NLK phosphorylates PERIOD to initiate a time-delay phosphorylation circuit that sets circadian clock speed | journal = Cell | volume = 145 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–70 |date=April 2011 | pmid = 21514639 | pmc = 3092788 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phosphorylated PER binds to the [[F-box protein]] SLIMB, and it is then targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.&lt;ref name="Kinetics" /&gt; Therefore, the phosphorylation of PER by DBT leads to a decrease in PER abundance, which is a necessary step in the function of the organism's internal clock.&lt;ref name="Kinetics" /&gt;

The activity of DBT on PER is aided by the activity of the proteins CKII and SGG, and it is antagonized by a rhythmically expressed protein phosphatase. It is possible, but currently unknown, if DBT regulates other functions of PER or of other circadian proteins.&lt;ref name="Drosophila DBT" /&gt; There has been no evidence that suggests that DBT binds directly to TIM.&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; Rather, the only kinase known to directly phosphorylate TIM is the SHAGGY (SGG) kinase protein, but this does not majorly affect TIM stability, suggesting the presence of a different kinase or phosphatase.&lt;ref name="pmid17575052"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fang Y, Sathyanarayanan S, Sehgal A | title = Post-translational regulation of the Drosophila circadian clock requires protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 1506–18 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17575052 | pmc = 1891428 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1541607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DBT does play a role in recruiting other kinases into PER repression complexes. These kinases phosphorylate the transcription factor CLK, which releases the CLK-[[Cycle (gene)|CYC]] complex from the [[E-Box]] and represses transcription.&lt;ref name="k2" /&gt;

=== Mutant alleles ===

There are three primary mutant alleles of ''dbt'': ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'', which shortens the organism's free-running period (its internal period in constant light conditions); ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'', which lengthens the free-running period; and ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;'', which causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling proteins and ''per'' and ''tim'' transcription.&lt;ref name="Double-Time1" /&gt; All mutants except for ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' produce differential PER degradation that directly correspond with their phenotypic behavior. ''Dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' PER degradation resembles wild-type DBT, which suggests that ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not affect the clock through this degradation mechanism. It has been suggested that ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' works by acting as a repressor or producing a different phosphoylation pattern of the substrate. ''Dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' causes early termination of ''per'' transcription.&lt;ref name="Kinetics" /&gt;

The ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'' mutation causes the period of PER and TIM [[oscillation]]s, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours. This extended rhythm is caused by a decreased rate of phosphorylation of PER due to lower DBT kinase activity levels. This mutation is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80→Ile mutation). The ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18–20 hours. There is no current evidence for the mechanism affected by the mutation, but it is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Pro-47→ Ser mutation).&lt;ref name = "Kinetics" /&gt;

Another ''dbt'' mutation is ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;AR&lt;/sup&gt;'', which causes arrhythmic activities in Drosophila. It a [[hypermorphic]] allele that is the result of a His 126→Tyr mutation. Homozygous flies with this mutation are viable but arrhythmic, whereas ''dbtAR/+'' heterozygotes have extra-long periods of about 29 hours, and their DBT kinase activity is reduced to the lowest rate of all of the DBT alleles.&lt;ref name = "Kinetics" /&gt;

=== Noncircadian ===

Clock gene mutations, including those to Drosophila's ''dbt'', alter the sensitivization of drug-induced locomotor activity after repeated exposure to [[psychostimulants]]. Drosophila with mutant alleles of ''dbt'' failed to display locomotor sensitivization in response to repeated [[cocaine]] exposure.&lt;ref name="Circadian"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosenwasser AM | title = Circadian clock genes: non-circadian roles in sleep, addiction, and psychiatric disorders? | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 1249–55 |date=July 2010 | pmid = 20307570 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is experimental evidence for this gene to function in 13 unique biological processes, including biological regulation, phosphorus metabolic process, establishment of planar polarity, positive regulation of biological process, cellular process, single-organism developmental process, response to stimulus, response to organic substance, sensory organ development, macromolecule modification, growth, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and rhythmic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene Dmel\dco|url=http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0002413.html|publisher=FlyBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene's alternative name, discs overgrown, refers to its role as a cell growth regulating gene that has strong effects of cell survival and growth control in [[imaginal disc]]s, an attribute of the [[larvae]] fly stage. The protein is necessary in the mechanism linking cell survival during [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] and growth arrest.&lt;ref name=Brody /&gt;

=== Noncatalytic ===

The DBT protein may play a noncatalytic role in attracting kinases that phosphorylate [[CLOCK]] ([[CLK1|CLK]]), an activator of transcription.&lt;ref name="k2" /&gt; DBT has a noncatalytic role in recruiting kinases, some of which have not yet been discovered, into the transcription translation feedback loop (TTFL).&lt;ref name="kelse"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | pmc = 2885980 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DBT's catalytic activity is not affiliated with the phosphorylation CLK or its transcriptional repression. PER phosphorylation by DBT is integral in repressing CLK-dependent transcription. The DBT protein plays a noncatalytic role in recruiting additional kinases that phosphorylate CLK indirectly, thus downregulating transcription. A similar pathway exists in mammals due to the mechanistic conservation of the CKI homolog.&lt;ref name="k2" /&gt; In 2004, In ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; mutants, ''Drosphila'' cells has reduced [[Casein kinase 1|CKI-7]] activity.&lt;ref name = "k2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Preuss F, Fan JY, Kalive M, Bao S, Schuenemann E, Bjes ES, Price JL | title = Drosophila doubletime mutations which either shorten or lengthen the period of circadian rhythms decrease the protein kinase activity of casein kinase I | journal = Mol.

== Mammalian homologs ==

=== Casein kinase I ===

The [[casein kinase 1]] (CKI) family of kinases is a highly conserved group of proteins that are found in organisms from [[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]], to Drosophila, to humans.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eide EJ, Virshup DM | title = Casein kinase I: another cog in the circadian clockworks | journal = Chronobiol. Int. | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 389–98 |date=May 2001 | pmid = 11475410 | doi = 10.1081/CBI-100103963| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because dbt is a member of this family, questions arose about the role of these related genes in other model systems. Within mammals, there are seven CKI [[protein isoform|isoforms]], all with various roles surrounding the phosphorylation of proteins. [[CSNK1E|CKIε]] was found to be most [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to dbt, with a similarity of 86%.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Along with this genetic similarity, the proteins have been found to be functionally homologous. Just as phosphorylation by dbt in Drosophila targets PER proteins for proteasome degradation, CKIε phosphorylation reduces the stability of mammalian PER proteins, labeling them for degradation.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanselow_Kramer_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanselow K, Kramer A | title = Role of phosphorylation in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 167–76 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18419274 | doi = 10.1101/sqb.2007.72.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virshup_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Virshup DM, Eide EJ, Forger DB, Gallego M, Harnish EV | title = Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates circadian rhythms | journal = Cold Spring Harb.

Biol. Rhythms | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18258753 | doi = 10.1177/0748730407311652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the functions are extremely similar. Specifically, CKIε has been shown to reduce the half-life of mPER1, one of the three mammalian PER homologs.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; In addition, nuclear localization of the mPER proteins is related to phosphorylation, adding another essential role to the activity of the CKIε protein.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Overall, the genetic similarity of dbt and CKIε is not the end of the story; the roles they play within the circadian clock in their respective systems are almost identical. Both are involved with periodic phosphorylation, regulating the oscillations of the circadian clocks.

=== Role of CKIε ===

Initially, the role of CKIε within the circadian clock of mammals was discovered as the result of a mutation in hamsters. The tau mutation in the Syrian [[golden hamster]] was the first to show a [[Heritability|heritable]] abnormality of circadian rhythms in mammals.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Hamsters with the mutation exhibit a shorter period than the wild-type. [[Zygosity|Heterozygotes]] have a period of about 22h while the period of homozygotes is even shorter, at about 20h.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Because of previous research indicating the role of dbt in establishing period, the tau mutation was found to be at the same locus as the CKIε gene.&lt;ref name="Lowrey_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lowrey PL, Shimomura K, Antoch MP, Yamazaki S, Zemenides PD, Ralph MR, Menaker M, Takahashi JS | title = Positional syntenic cloning and functional characterization of the mammalian circadian mutation tau | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5465 | pages = 483–92 |date=April 2000 | pmid = 10775102 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5465.483| url = | bibcode = 2000Sci...288..483L | pmc = 3869379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this mutation relates to the mutations ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'', which both effect the internal period of the fly. However, it seems that the forces driving these changes in period are different. It was found that the point mutation resulting in the tau mutant decreased the activity of the CKIε kinase [[in vitro]]. In flies, on the other hand, the ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'' mutation is associated with a decrease in dbt activity and a longer period. This is consistent with another experiment done on hamsters that showed a lengthening of the period caused by CKI inhibition.&lt;ref name="Virshup_2007"/&gt; To investigate this discrepancy, researchers studied the [[half-life]] of PER2 under the influence of wild-type CKIε, CKIεtau, and CKIε (K38A) which is a kinase-inactive mutant.&lt;ref name="Virshup_2007"/&gt; The results indicated that the tau mutation was actually a gain-of-function mutation, instead of loss-of-function, that caused the more rapid degradation of the PER proteins. Therefore, the tau mutation in hamsters can be seen as similar to mutations in dbt that change the internal period.

=== Importance of rhythmic phosphorylation ===

A role of CKIε has also been seen in humans related to [[FASPS|Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome]], in which individuals have a much shorter period than the typical human. In this case, it does not seem to be a mutation of the CKIε protein itself, but instead in the [[binding site]] for phosphorylation of the PER2 protein.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt;

In addition, kinase activity has been shown to be involved in the [[Nuclear transport|nuclear localization]] of PER and other genes involved in circadian rhythmicity.&lt;ref name="pmid17452453"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nawathean P, Stoleru D, Rosbash M | title = A small conserved domain of Drosophila PERIOD is important for circadian phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transcriptional repressor activity | journal = Mol. Cell. Biol. | volume = 27 | issue = 13 | pages = 5002–13 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17452453 | pmc = 1951469 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.02338-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is this phosphorylation that allows PER to repress its own [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and place a delay on the circadian system. Without the phosphorylation of PER, by dbt in Drosophila or by CKIε in mammals, there would be no oscillations because the [[Feedback|feedback loop]] would be broken.

It has even been proposed that this rhythmic phosphorylation itself might be a driving factor of circadian clocks. Up to this point, the transcription-translation negative feedback loop has been identified as the source of oscillations and rhythms in biological clocks. But, experiments with phosphorylation of the [[cyanobacteria]]l protein [[KaiC]] in vitro showed that rhythms persisted without the presence of any transcription or translation.&lt;ref name="pmid15831759"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, kinases like dbt and CKIε might play even more important roles within circadian clocks than just targeting proteins for degradation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">'''Drag cost''' is a [[project management]] metric&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devaux| first=Stephen A.| title=Total Project Control: A Manager's Guide to Integrated Project Planning, Measuring, and Tracking| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 138 - 146, 1999 |isbn=0-471-32859-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Stephen Devaux as part of the [[Total Project Control]] (TPC) approach to project schedule and cost analysis. It is the amount by which a [[project]]’s expected [[return on investment]] (ROI) is reduced due to the [[critical path drag]] of a specific [[critical path method|critical path]] activity [[Task (project management)]] or other specific schedule factor such as a schedule lag or other delaying constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Devaux [http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Jan_Feb_2012/Devaux.pdf "The Drag Efficient: The Missing Quantification of Time on the Critical Path"] Defense AT&amp;L magazine of the Defense Acquisition University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag cost is computed at the activity level, but is caused by the impact at the project level due to:

1. A reduction in a project’s expected value because of later completion, or 
2. An increase in a project’s cost due to its [[indirect costs]] being increased because of a longer project duration.

Drag cost computation is often used on projects in order to justify additional project [[resources]]. For example, if a project’s expected ROI will be reduced by $5,000 for every day of duration, then an activity that has critical path drag of ten days (i.e., is delaying project completion by ten days) will have a drag cost of $50,000. If the addition of a resource that costs $10,000 would reduce the activity’s drag to five days, the drag cost would be reduced by $25,000 and the project’s expected ROI would be increased by $15,000 ($25,000 minus the additional $10,000 of resource costs).

On projects which are performed for non-monetary reasons, such as public literacy programs or emergency response, drag cost can be measured in units of reduction in citizens educated or lives lost due to the additional time taken by critical path activities.&lt;ref name="Devaux"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Devaux |first=Stephen A. |title=Handbook of Emergency Response: A Human Factors and Systems Engineering Approach, A Badiru and L. Racz, ed. |publisher=CRC Press |year=2013 |pages=501–530 |chapter=Chapter 21: “Time Is a Murderer: The Cost of Critical Path Drag in Emergency Response” }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Just as drag is only found on the critical path, the same is true of drag cost.

In [[bioinorganic chemistry]], an '''entatic state''' is "a state of an atom or group which, due to its binding in a protein, has its geometric or electronic condition adapted for function."&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Entatic state |file=ET06763 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Vallee and Williams,&lt;ref&gt;Vallee BL, Williams RJP (1968) ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'' '''59''', 498.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the "rack mechanism" of Malmstrom.&lt;ref name=dft&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles and Applications of Density Functional Theory in Inorganic Chemistry |author1=Nikolas Kaltsoyannis |author2=John E. McGrady |author3=Jochen Autschbach |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=3-540-21861-0 |pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states are thought to enhance the chemistry of metal ions in biological catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms |author1=Perry A Frey |author2=Adrian D Hegeman |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-512258-5 |pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an entatic state is the copper center in [[plastocyanin]], a redox enzyme. In this protein, the copper shuttles between oxidized and reduced states, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Each oxidation state prefers a distinct [[coordination geometry]]: whereas copper(II) is normally square planar and prefers [[HSAB|hard bases]] such as oxygen and nitrogen ligands, copper(I) is normally tetrahedral and binds preferentially to soft bases such as sulphur ligands. Because the electron transfer rate depends on the [[reorganization energy]], the ideal rate would be obtained for Cu centers having a geometry intermediate between the requirements of each oxidation state. In fact, the Cu site is neither planar nor tetrahedral it is considered a distorted tetrahedral, with two nitrogen ligands from histidine residues and two sulphur ligands from methionine and cysteine residues, and can therefore be considered an entatic state. Under the entatic state hypothesis, the distortion results from strain caused by binding to ligands with relative orientation that is pre-arranged by the protein.

Some theoretical calculations show that a model system can have a geometry similar to that observed in the protein without any strain; these results, however, remain controversial.&lt;ref name=dft/&gt;

The '''evo-devo gene toolkit''' is the small subset of [[gene]]s in an organism's [[genome]] whose products control the organism's [[developmental biology|embryonic development]]. '''Toolkit genes''' are central to the synthesis of [[molecular genetics]], [[palaeontology]], [[evolution]] and developmental biology in the science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

==Toolkit==

Toolkit genes are highly [[conserved sequence|conserved]] among [[Phylum|phyla]], meaning that they are ancient, dating back to the [[Urbilaterian|last common ancestor of bilaterian animals]]. For example, that ancestor had at least 7 [[Pax genes]] for [[transcription factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedrich|first1=Markus|title=Evo-Devo gene toolkit update: at least seven Pax transcription factor subfamilies in the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals Authors|journal=Evolution &amp; Development|date=2015|volume=17|issue=5|pages=255–257|doi=10.1111/ede.12137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts.  The majority of toolkit genes are components of signaling pathways, and encode for the production of transcription factors, [[cell adhesion]] proteins, cell surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins (and signalling [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind to them), and secreted [[morphogens]], all of these participate in defining the fate of undifferentiated cells, generating spatial and temporal patterns, which in turn form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Among the most important of the toolkit genes are those of the [[Hox gene]] cluster, or complex. Hox genes, transcription factors containing the more broadly distributed [[homeobox]] protein-binding DNA motif, function in patterning the body axis. Thus, by combinatorial specifying the identity of particular body regions, Hox genes determine where [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and other [[Anatomy|body]] segments will grow in a developing [[embryo]] or [[larva]]. A [[wikt:paradigm|paradigm]]atic toolkit gene is ''Pax6/eyeless'', which controls [[eye]] formation in all animals. It has been found to produce eyes in mice and ''[[Drosophila]]'', even if mouse ''Pax6/eyeless'' was expressed in ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xu, P.X. |author2=Woo, I. |author3=Her, H. |author4=Beier, D.R. |author5=Maas, R.L. |year=1997 |title=Mouse Eya homologues of the Drosophila eyes absent gene require Pax6 for expression in lens and nasal placode |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=1 |pmid=9006082 |pages=219–231 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that a big part of the morphological evolution undergone by organisms is a product of variation in the genetic toolkit, either by the genes changing their expression pattern or acquiring new functions. A good example of the first is the enlargement of the beak in Darwin's large ground-finch ([[large ground-finch|''Geospiza magnirostris'']]), in which the gene ''[[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]]'' is responsible for the larger beak of this bird, relative to the other finches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abzhanov, A. |author2=Protas, M. |author3=Grant, B.R. |author4=Grant, P.R. |author5=Tabin, C.J. |year=2004 |title=Bmp4 and Morphological Variation of Beaks in Darwin's Finches |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5689| doi=10.1126/science.1098095 |pages=1462–1465 |pmid=15353802 |bibcode=2004Sci...305.1462A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of legs in [[snake]]s and other [[Squamata|squamates]] is another good example of genes changing their expression pattern. In this case the gene ''[[Dlx (gene)|Distal-less]]'' is very under-expressed, or not expressed at all, in the regions where limbs would form in other [[tetrapod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohn, M.J. |author2=Tickle, C. |title=Developmental basis of limblessness and axial patterning in snakes |year=1999 |journal=Nature |volume=399 |pages=474–479 |pmid=10365960 |issue=6735 |doi=10.1038/20944 |bibcode=1999Natur.399..474C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994, [[Sean B. Carroll]]'s team made the "groundbreaking" discovery that this same gene determines the [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot pattern]] in [[butterfly]] [[wing]]s, showing that toolbox genes can change their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beldade, P. |author2=Brakefield, P.M. |author3=Long, A.D. |year=2002 |title=Contribution of Distal-less to quantitative variation in butterfly eyespots |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6869 |pages=315–318 |pmid=11797007 |doi=10.1038/415315a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Thomas|title=Leopard Spots and Zebra Stripes on Fruit Fly Wings|journal=Nature Education|date=2015|volume=8|issue=2|page=3|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-131087142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean B. et al|title=Pattern formation and eyespot determination in butterfly wings|journal=Science|date=1994|volume=265|pages=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toolkit genes, as well as being highly conserved, also tend to evolve the same function [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or [[Parallel Evolution|in parallel]]. Classic examples of this are the already mentioned ''Distal-less'' gene, which is responsible for appendage formation in both tetrapods and insects, or, at a finer scale, the generation of wing patterns in the butterflies ''[[Heliconius erato]]'' and ''[[Heliconius melpomene]]''. These butterflies&lt;!--just mentioned butterfly eyespots above, the same species?? If so, should merge paragraphs--&gt; are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] whose coloration pattern arose in different evolutionary events, but is controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baxter, S.W. |author2=Papa, R. |author3=Chamberlain, N. |author4=Humphray, S.J. |author5=Joron, M. |author6=Morrison, C. |author7=ffrench-Constant, R.H. |author8=McMillan, W.O. |author9=Jiggins, C.D. |year=2008 |title=Convergent Evolution in the Genetic Basis of Mullerian Mimicry in Heliconius Butterflies |journal=Genetics |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=1567–1577 | pmid=18791259 |pmc=2581958 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.082982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This supports [[Marc Kirschner]] and [[John C. Gerhart]]'s theory of [[Facilitated variation|Facilitated Variation]], which states that morphological evolutionary novelty is generated by regulatory changes in various members of a large set of conserved mechanisms of development and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerhart |first=John |last2=Kirschner |first2=Marc |year=2007 |title=The theory of facilitated variation |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmid=17494755 |volume=104 | pmc=1876433 |issue=suppl1 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701035104 |pages=8582–8589|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8582G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scientific theory]] of evolution by natural selection was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin's book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink = Charles Darwin |year=1860 |title=On the Origin of Species |place=London |publisher=John Murray |edition=2nd |pages=490 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F376&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution by natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable [[fact]]s about living organisms: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, [[physiology]] and behaviour ([[Phenotype#Phenotypic variation|phenotypic variation]]), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and [[reproduction]] (differential [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]) and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation ([[heritability]] of fitness).&lt;ref name="Lewontin70"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=November 1970 |title=The Units of Selection |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.01.110170.000245 |jstor=2096764 |issn=1545-2069 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206172942/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in successive generations members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the [[offspring|progenies]] of parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in their respective [[biophysical environment|environments]].

=== Classical times ===
The proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Anaximander#Origin of humankind|Anaximander]] and [[Empedocles#Cosmogony|Empedocles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|1983|pp=100–142, 280–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals survived into Roman times. The [[poet]] and philosopher [[Lucretius]] followed Empedocles in his masterwork ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (''On the Nature of Things'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucretius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedley |first=David |authorlink=David Sedley |year=2003 |title=Lucretius and the New Empedocles |url=http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Leeds International Classical Studies |volume=2 |issue=4 |issn=1477-3643 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823062637/http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
In contrast to these [[Materialism|materialistic]] views, [[Aristotelianism]] considered all natural things as [[potentiality and actuality|actualisations]] of fixed natural possibilities, known as [[Theory of forms|forms]].&lt;ref name="Torrey37"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torrey |first1=Harry Beal |last2=Felin |first2=Frances |date=March 1937 |title=Was Aristotle an Evolutionist? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1086/394520 |issn=0033-5770 |jstor=2808399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hull |first=David L. |authorlink=David Hull |date=December 1967 |title=The Metaphysics of Evolution |journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=309–337 |doi=10.1017/S0007087400002892 |jstor=4024958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a medieval [[teleology|teleological]] understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] in which all things have an intended role to play in a [[divinity|divine]] [[cosmos|cosmic]] order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the [[Middle Ages]] and were integrated into [[Christianity|Christian]] learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason|1962|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
In the 17th century, the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]] rejected the Aristotelian approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[physical law]]s that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, "species," to plant and animal types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=256–257}}
* {{harvnb|Ray|1686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological classification introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |title=Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |date=July 7, 2000 |website=Evolution |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430160025/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Natural history|naturalists]] of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws.

=== Darwinian revolution ===
The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798) by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.&lt;ref name="Sober09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |date=June 16, 2009 |title=Did Darwin write the ''Origin'' backwards? |journal=Proc.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using [[paleontology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] to provide strong evidence that humans and [[ape]]s shared a common ancestry.

=== Pangenesis and heredity ===
The mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of [[pangenesis]].&lt;ref name="Liu09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Y. S. |last2=Zhou |first2=X. M. |last3=Zhi |first3=M.

[[Hugo de Vries]] connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the [[cell nucleus]] and when expressed they could move into the [[cytoplasm]] to change the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]'s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline.&lt;ref name="Wright84"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1984|p=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed [[Mutationism|a mutation theory]] that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries.&lt;ref name="Gould02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamhuis |first1=Ida H. |last2=Meijer |first2=Onno G. |last3=Zevenhuizen |first3=Erik J.

=== The 'modern synthesis' ===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}
In the 1920s and 1930s the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] connected natural selection and population genetics, based on Mendelian inheritance, into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations, through [[Transitional fossil|fossil transitions]] in palaeontology, and complex cellular mechanisms in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name="Gould02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1989}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the structure of [[DNA]] by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] with contribution of [[Rosalind Franklin]] in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.&lt;ref name="Watson53"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=J.

=== Further syntheses ===
Since then, the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the [[Biological organisation|biological hierarchy]], from genes to species. One extension, known as [[evolutionary developmental biology]] and informally called "evo-devo," emphasises how changes between generations (evolution) acts on patterns of change within individual organisms ([[Developmental biology|development]]).&lt;ref name="Kutschera"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J.

Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[Eye color|eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Richard A. |last2=Frudakis |first2=Tony N. |date=August 2004 |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=15262401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] (genetic material) is called its genotype.&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Helen |date=May 25, 2006 |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P |doi=10.1038/441398a |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16724031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Hill |first2=William G. |authorlink2=William G. Hill |last3=Wray |first3=Naomi R. |date=April 2008 |title=Heritability in the genomics era — concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–266 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=18319743}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oetting |first1=William S. |last2=Brilliant |first2=Murray H. |last3=King |first3=Richard A. |date=August 1996 |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Molecular Medicine Today]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–335 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |issn=1357-4310 |pmid=8796918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006" /&gt; DNA is a long [[biopolymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles.

{{main|Genetic variation}}
{{Further|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amos |first1=William |last2=Harwood |first2=John |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177–186 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692205 |pmid=9533122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butlin |first1=Roger K. |last2=Tregenza |first2=Tom |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=187–198 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0201 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692210 |pmid=9533123}}

=== Mutation ===
{{Main|Mutation}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]]]]
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |author3=Zhang Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |date=April 17, 2007 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Proc.

Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming [[gene duplication|duplicated]] (usually by [[genetic recombination]]), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hastings |first1=P.

New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the [[Gene redundancy|redundancy]] of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=T.

=== Sex and recombination ===
{{Further|Sexual reproduction|Genetic recombination|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called [[homologous recombination]], sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Radding |first=Charles M. |date=December 1982 |title=Homologous Pairing and Strand Exchange in Genetic Recombination |journal=[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Review of Genetics]] |volume=16 |pages=405–437 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.16.120182.002201 |issn=0066-4197 |pmid=6297377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles.&lt;ref name=Agrawal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agrawal |first=Aneil F. |date=September 5, 2006 |title=Evolution of Sex: Why Do Organisms Shuffle Their Genotypes? |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=R696–R704 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.063 |issn=0960-9822 |pmid=16950096|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peters |first1=Andrew D. |last2=Otto |first2=Sarah P. |date=June 2003 |title=Liberating genetic variance through sex |journal=[[BioEssays]] |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=533–537 |doi=10.1002/bies.10291 |issn=0265-9247 |pmid=12766942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goddard |first1=Matthew R. |last2=Godfray |first2=H.

(This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many [[invertebrate]]s.) The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes.&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|1993}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms.

Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morjan |first1=Carrie L. |last2=Rieseberg |first2=Loren H. |authorlink2=Loren H.

Gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of [[pollen]] between heavy-metal-tolerant and heavy-metal-sensitive populations of grasses.

Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]].

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Mutation]] followed by natural selection results in a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms,&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004" /&gt; for example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
{{Further|Sexual selection}}
Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:&lt;ref name="Lewontin70" /&gt;
* Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation).
* Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness).
* These traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).

More offspring are produced than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hurst |first=Laurence D. |authorlink=Laurence Hurst |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |date=February 2009 |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83–93 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=19119264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[teleonomy]] is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are [[teleology in biology|seemingly fitted]] for the [[function (biology)|functional]] roles they perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 Chapter XIV]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences of selection include [[Assortative mating|nonrandom mating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Otto |first1=Sarah P. |author-link1=Sarah Otto |last2=Servedio |first2=Maria R. |last3=Nuismer |first3=Scott L. |title=Frequency-Dependent Selection and the Evolution of Assortative Mating |journal=Genetics |date=August 2008 |volume=179 |issue=4 |pages=2091–2112 |issn=0016-6731 |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084418 |pmc=2516082 |pmid=18660541|bibcode=2001gpm..book.....L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetic hitchhiking]].

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism.&lt;ref name="Orr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H. Allen |authorlink=H.

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected ''for''." Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer—they are "selected ''against''."&lt;ref name="Lande"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Russell |authorlink1=Russell Lande |last2=Arnold |first2=Stevan J. |date=November 1983 |title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1210–1226 |doi=10.2307/2408842 |pmid=28556011 |issn=0014-3820 |jstor=2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.&lt;ref name="Futuyma_2005" /&gt; However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law of irreversibility|Dollo's law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Emma E. |last2=Igić |first2=Boris |date=November 2008 |title=On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2727–2741 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=18764918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collin |first1=Rachel |last2=Miglietta |first2=Maria Pia |date=November 2008 |title=Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=602–609 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 |issn=0169-5347 |pmid=18814933}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a re-activation of dormant genes, as long as they have not been eliminated from the genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations, can lead to the re-occurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in [[dolphin]]s, teeth in [[chicken]]s, wings in wingless stick [[insect]]s, tails and additional nipples in humans etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomić |first1=Nenad |last2=Meyer-Rochow |first2=Victor Benno |year=2011 |title=Atavisms: Medical, Genetic, and Evolutionary Implications |journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=332–353 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034 |issn=0031-5982 |pmid=21857125}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Throwbacks" such as these are known as [[atavism]]s.

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoekstra |first1=Hopi E. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Jonathan M. |last3=Berrigan |first3=David |last4=Vignieri |first4=Sacha N. |last5=Hoang |first5=Amy |last6=Hill |first6=Caryl E. |last7=Beerli |first7=Peter |last8=Kingsolver |first8=Joel G. |date=July 31, 2001 |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilising selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.&lt;ref name="Hurst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felsenstein |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Felsenstein |date=November 1979 |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773–795 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214112 |pmid=17248980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to eventually have a similar height.

A special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersson |first1=Malte |last2=Simmons |first2=Leigh W. |date=June 2006 |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=296–302 |pmid=16769428 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015 |issn=0169-5347 |url=http://academic.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/2_anderson-simmons_2006.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309112854/http://academic.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/2_Anderson-Simmons_2006.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-09 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.595.4050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature" in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[Abiotic component|physical]] as well as [[Biotic component|biological]], in their local environment. [[Eugene Odum]], a founder of [[ecology]], defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e., exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system...."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;{{harvnb|Odum|1971|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

Natural selection can act at [[unit of selection|different levels of organisation]], such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.&lt;ref name="Okasha07"&gt;{{harvnb|Okasha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=307–314 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0211 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692213 |pmid=9533127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=March 18, 1997 |title=The objects of selection |journal=Proc.

Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes.

=== Genetic hitchhiking ===
{{Further|Genetic hitchhiking|Hill–Robertson effect|Selective sweep}}
Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lien |first1=Sigbjørn |last2=Szyda |first2=Joanna |last3=Schechinger |first3=Birgit |last4=Rappold |first4=Gudrun |last5=Arnheim |first5=Norm |date=February 2000 |title=Evidence for Heterogeneity in Recombination in the Human Pseudoautosomal Region: High Resolution Analysis by Sperm Typing and Radiation-Hybrid Mapping |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=557–566 |doi=10.1086/302754 |issn=0002-9297 |pmc=1288109 |pmid=10677316 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to [[independence (probability theory)|expectations]], which is called their [[linkage disequilibrium]]. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=Nicholas H. |authorlink=Nick Barton |date=November 29, 2000 |title=Genetic hitchhiking |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1553–1562 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692896 |pmid=11127900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.&lt;ref name="gillespie 2001" /&gt;

=== Gene flow ===
{{Further|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56" /&gt; The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the [[Species problem#Mayr's Biological Species Concept|''Biological Species Concept'']] (BSC).

During the development of the modern synthesis, Sewall Wright developed his [[shifting balance theory]], which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |authorlink=Sewall Wright |year=1932 |title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |journal=Proceedings of the VI International Congress of Genetrics |volume=1 |pages=356–366 |accessdate=2014-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063103/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory.&lt;ref name="Coyne 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry A. |authorlink1=Jerry Coyne |last2=Barton |first2=Nicholas H. |last3=Turelli |first3=Michael |date=June 1997 |title=Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution |journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=643–671 |doi=10.2307/2411143 |pmid=28568586 |issn=0014-3820|jstor=2411143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding [[Predation|predators]] or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as [[macroevolution]] versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in [[allele frequency]] and adaptation.&lt;ref name="ScottEC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new [[habitat]]s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658}}&lt;ref name="Gould_1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=July 19, 1994 |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=483}}: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sixth edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' (2010) defines ''adaptation'' as "Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of [[horse]]s' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H.

# ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1968|pp=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Adaptedness'' is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1970|pp=4–6, 79–82, 84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An ''adaptive trait'' is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |date=March 1956 |title=Genetics of Natural Populations.

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakajima |first1=Akira |last2=Sugimoto |first2=Yohko |last3=Yoneyama |first3=Hiroshi |last4=Nakae |first4=Taiji |date=June 2002 |title=High-Level Fluoroquinolone Resistance in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' Due to Interplay of the MexAB-OprM Efflux Pump and the DNA Gyrase Mutation |journal=Microbiology and Immunology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=391–395 |doi=10.1111/j.1348-0421.2002.tb02711.x |issn=1348-0421 |pmid=12153116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other striking examples are the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' evolving the ability to use [[citric acid]] as a nutrient in a [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term laboratory experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blount |first1=Zachary D. |last2=Borland |first2=Christina Z. |last3=Lenski |first3=Richard E. |date=June 10, 2008 |title=Inaugural Article: Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of ''Escherichia coli'' |journal=Proc.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within [[bat]] wings, for example, are very similar to those in [[mouse|mice]] feet and [[primate]] hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Nathan M. |last2=HallgrÍmsson |first2=Benedikt |date=December 2005 |title=Serial homology and the evolution of mammalian limb covariation structure |journal=Evolution |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=2691–2704 |doi=10.1554/05-233.1 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=16526515}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since all living organisms are related to some extent,&lt;ref name="Penny1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=David |last2=Poole |first2=Anthony |date=December 1999 |title=The nature of the last universal common ancestor |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=672–677 |doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(99)00020-9 |issn=0959-437X |pmid=10607605}}&lt;/ref&gt; even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as [[arthropod]], [[squid]] and [[vertebrate]] eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called [[deep homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Brian K. |date=August 2003 |title=Descent with modification: the unity underlying homology and homoplasy as seen through an analysis of development and evolution |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=409–433 |doi=10.1017/S1464793102006097 |issn=1464-7931 |pmid=14558591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shubin |first1=Neil |authorlink1=Neil Shubin |last2=Tabin |first2=Clifford J. |authorlink2=Clifford Tabin |last3=Carroll |first3=Sean B. |date=February 12, 2009 |title=Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=818–823 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..818S |doi=10.1038/nature07891 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=19212399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coevolution ===

{{Further|Coevolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]] that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paszkowski |first=Uta |date=August 2006 |title=Mutualism and parasitism: the yin and yang of plant symbioses |journal=[[Current Opinion (Elsevier)|Current Opinion in Plant Biology]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=364–370 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.008 |issn=1369-5266 |pmid=16713732}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocal]] relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from [[photosynthesis]]. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending [[signal transduction|signals]] that suppress the plant [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hause |first1=Bettina |last2=Fester |first2=Thomas |date=May 2005 |title=Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis |journal=[[Planta (journal)|Planta]] |volume=221 |issue=2 |pages=184–196 |doi=10.1007/s00425-004-1436-x |issn=0032-0935 |pmid=15871030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in social insects, such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].&lt;ref name="Bertram"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertram |first=John S. |date=December 2000 |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=[[Molecular Aspects of Medicine]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |issn=0098-2997 |pmid=11173079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of [[kin selection]], which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reeve |first1=H.

=== Speciation ===
{{main|Speciation}}

[[File:Speciation modes edit.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.6|The four geographic modes of [[speciation]]]]

Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gavrilets |first=Sergey |date=October 2003 |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2215 |doi=10.1554/02-727 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=14628909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways to define the concept of "species." The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.&lt;ref name="Queiroz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Kevin |date=May 3, 2005 |title=Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=102 |issue=Suppl. 1 |pages=6600–6607 |bibcode=2005PNAS..102.6600D |doi=10.1073/pnas.0502030102 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=1131873 |pmid=15851674}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.&lt;ref name="Ereshefsky92"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Ereshefsky |date=December 1992 |title=Eliminative pluralism |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=671–690 |doi=10.1086/289701 |issn=0031-8248 |jstor=188136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Biological Species Concept'' (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach. Defined by evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1942, the BSC states that "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1942|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Christophe |last2=Alm |first2=Eric J. |last3=Polz |first3=Martin F. |last4=Spratt |first4=Brian G. |last5=Hanage |first5=William P. |date=February 6, 2009 |title=The Bacterial Species Challenge: Making Sense of Genetic and Ecological Diversity |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5915 |pages=741–746 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..741F |doi=10.1126/science.1159388 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=19197054 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is called the [[species problem]].&lt;ref name="Queiroz" /&gt; Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.&lt;ref name="Queiroz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ereshefsky92" /&gt;

[[Reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their [[most recent common ancestor]], it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and [[donkey]]s mating to produce [[mule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Short |first=Roger Valentine |date=October 1975 |title=The contribution of the mule to scientific thought |journal=Journal of Reproduction and Fertility.

In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Briana L. |last2=Rieseberg |first2=Loren H. |date=May–June 2005 |title=The Ecological Genetics of Homoploid Hybrid Speciation |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=241–252 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esi026 |issn=0022-1503 |pmc=2517139 |pmid=15618301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of hybridisation in producing [[hybrid speciation|new species]] of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burke |first1=John M. |last2=Arnold |first2=Michael L. |date=December 2001 |title=Genetics and the fitness of hybrids |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=35 |pages=31–52 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.085719 |issn=0066-4197 |pmid=11700276}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[gray tree frog]] being a particularly well-studied example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vrijenhoek |first=Robert C. |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Polyploid Hybrids: Multiple Origins of a Treefrog Species |journal=Current Biology |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=R245–R247 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.005 |issn=0960-9822 |pmid=16581499|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herrel |first1=Anthony |last2=Huyghe |first2=Katleen |last3=Vanhooydonck |first3=Bieke |last4=Backeljau |first4=Thierry |last5=Breugelmans |first5=Karin |last6=Grbac |first6=Irena |last7=Van Damme |first7=Raoul |last8=Irschick |first8=Duncan J. |date=March 25, 2008 |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proc.

The second mode of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation after an increase in [[inbreeding]] increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Templeton |first=Alan R. |authorlink=Alan Templeton |date=April 1980 |title=The Theory of Speciation ''VIA'' the Founder Principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1038 |pmid=6777243 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214177 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063455/http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mode is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets" /&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovics |first=Janis |authorlink=Janis Antonovics |date=July 2006 |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |issn=0018-067X |pmid=16639420 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063443/http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]], which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nosil |first1=Patrik |last2=Crespi |first2=Bernard J. |last3=Gries |first3=Regine |last4=Gries |first4=Gerhard |date=March 2007 |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–327 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |pmid=16900317 |issn=0016-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in [[sympatric speciation]] species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat.

One type of sympatric speciation involves [[crossbreed]]ing of two related species to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form [[polyploidy|polyploids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Troy E. |last2=Takebayashi |first2=Naoki |last3=Barker |first3=Michael S. |last4=Mayrose |first4=Itay |last5=Greenspoon |first5=Philip B. |last6=Rieseberg |first6=Loren H. |date=August 18, 2009 |title=The frequency of polyploid speciation in vascular plants |journal=Proc.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eldredge|Gould|1972|pp=82–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.&lt;ref name="Gould_1994" /&gt;

Second, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Third, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups—similar to a family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern research has suggested that, due to horizontal gene transfer, this "tree of life" may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doolittle |first1=W.

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history. Fossils, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record.&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jablonski |first=David |date=June 25, 1999 |title=The Future of the Fossil Record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–2116 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Stephen F. |date=September 6, 1984 |title=Origins of biomolecular handedness |journal=Nature |volume=311 |issue=5981 |pages=19–23 |bibcode=1984Natur.311...19M |doi=10.1038/311019a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=6472461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[molecular genetics]] has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the [[molecular clock]] produced by mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=Yuri I. |last2=Rogozin |first2=Igor B. |last3=Grishin |first3=Nick V. |last4=Koonin |first4=Eugene V. |authorlink4=Eugene Koonin |date=September 1, 2002 |title=Genome trees and the tree of life |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=472–479 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02744-0 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=12175808}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varki |first1=Ajit |authorlink1=Ajit Varki |last2=Altheide |first2=Tasha K. |date=December 2005 |title=Comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes: searching for needles in a haystack |journal=Genome Research |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1746–1758 |doi=10.1101/gr.3737405 |issn=1088-9051 |pmid=16339373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century.  The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision.  Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] form as [[intelligent design]] (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.

'''Food irradiation''' is the process of exposing food and food packaging to [[ionizing radiation]]. Ionizing radiation, such as from gamma rays, x-rays or electron beams, is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy ([[radiation]]) capable of freeing [[electron]]s from their atomic bonds ([[ionization]]) in the targeted food.&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;{{cite book |author=WHO |title=Food Irradiation: A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food |year=1988 |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/38544 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva, Switzerland |isbn=978-924-154240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/fact-sheets/irradiation/eng/1332358607968/1332358680017 "Food Irradiation"] Canadian Food Inspection Agency. March 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The radiation can be emitted by a [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] substance or generated electrically.

==Uses==
Irradiation is used to reduce or eliminate the risk of food-borne illnesses, prevent or slow down spoilage, arrest maturation or sprouting and as a treatment against pests. Depending on the dose, some or all of the pathogenic organisms, [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es present are destroyed, slowed down, or rendered incapable of reproduction. Irradiation cannot return spoiled or over-ripe food to a fresh state. If this food was processed by irradiation, further spoilage would cease and ripening would slow down, yet the irradiation would not destroy the toxins or repair the texture, color, or taste of the food.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loaharanu|first=Paisan|year=1990|title=Food irradiation: Facts or fiction?.|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|journal=IAEA Bulletin|issue=32.2|pages=44–48|accessdate=March 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152545/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When targeting bacteria, most foods are irradiated to significantly reduce the number of active microbes, not to sterilize all microbes in the product. In this respect it is similar to pasteurization.

Irradiation is used to create safe foods for people at high risk of infection, or for conditions where food must be stored for long periods of time and proper storage conditions are not available. Foods that can tolerate irradiation at sufficient doses are treated to ensure that the product is completely [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. This is most commonly done with rations for astronauts, and special diets for hospital patients.

Irradiation is used to create shelf-stable products. Since irradiation reduces the populations of spoilage microorganisms, and because pre-packed food can be irradiated, the packaging prevents recontamination of the final product.&lt;ref name="FI" /&gt;

Irradiation is used to reduce post-harvest losses. It reduces populations of spoilage micro-organisms in the food and can slow down the speed at which enzymes change the food, and therefore slows spoilage and ripening, and inhibits sprouting (e.g., of potato, onion, and garlic).&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

Food is also irradiated to prevent the spread of invasive pest species through trade in fresh vegetables and fruits, either within countries, or trade across international boundaries. Pests such as insects could be transported to new habitats through trade in fresh produce which could significantly affect agricultural production and the environment were they to establish themselves. This "[[phytosanitary irradiation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/88667 | title=Phytosanitary irradiation: An overview| journal=Florida Entomologist| volume=99| issue=6| pages=1–13| date=2016-11-20| last1=Blackburn| first1=Carl M.| last2=Parker| first2=Andrew G.| last3=Hénon| first3=Yves M.| last4=Hallman| first4=Guy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to render any hitch-hiking pest incapable of breeding. The pests are [[sterility (physiology)|sterilized]] when the food is treated by low doses of irradiation. In general, the higher doses required to destroy pests such as insects, mealybugs, mites, moths, and butterflies either affect the look or taste, or cannot be tolerated by fresh produce.&lt;ref&gt;Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, IAEA, International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization&amp;nbsp;– IDIDAS&amp;nbsp;– http://www-ididas.iaea.org/IDIDAS/default.htm last visited November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Low dosage treatments (less than 1000 gray) enables trade across quarantine boundaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/sphs/sphr/2015/00000011/00000003/art00008 | title=Australia export programmes for irradiated fresh produce to New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also help reduce spoilage.

==Impact==
Irradiation reduces the risk of infection and spoilage, does not make food radioactive, and the food is shown to be safe, but it does cause chemical reactions that alter the food and therefore alters the chemical makeup, nutritional content, and the sensory qualities of the food.&lt;ref name="NYT_P.O."&gt;Martin, Andrew. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1261545694-KGCNC1z9SSW95acAk0gz0g Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' February 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the transportation and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, changes in the way we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.

===Immediate effects===
The radiation source supplies energetic particles or waves. As these waves/particles pass through a target material they [[Event (particle physics)|collide with other particles]]. Around the sites of these collisions [[chemical bonds]] are broken, creating short lived radicals (e.g. the [[hydroxyl radical]], the hydrogen atom and [[solvated electron]]s). These radicals cause further chemical changes by bonding with and or stripping particles from nearby molecules. When collisions damage [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], effective [[reproduction]] becomes unlikely, also when collisions occur in cells, [[cell division]] is often suppressed.&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;

Irradiation (within the accepted energy limits, as 10 MeV for electrons, 5 MeV for X-rays [US 7.5 MeV] and gamma rays from [[Cobalt-60]]) can not make food radioactive, but it does produce [[#Chemical changes|radiolytic products, and free radicals]] in the food. A few of these products are unique, but not considered dangerous.&lt;ref name="EPA-food-safety" /&gt;

Irradiation can also alter the [[#Food quality|nutritional content and flavor of foods]], much like cooking.&lt;ref name="EPA-food-safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/sources/food_safety.html |title=Radiation Protection-Food Safety|publisher=epa.gov |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of these chemical changes is not unique. Cooking, smoking, salting, and other less novel techniques, cause the food to be altered so drastically that its original nature is almost unrecognizable, and must be called by a different name. Storage of food also causes dramatic chemical changes, ones that eventually lead to deterioration and spoilage.&lt;ref name="ROT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-at-home.org/kid-question-rotting/ |title=kid question rotting |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misconceptions====
A major concern is that irradiation might cause chemical changes that are harmful to the consumer. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume as long as it remains palatable and maintains its technical properties (e.g. feel, texture, or color).&lt;ref name="JECFI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI"/&gt;

Irradiated food does not become radioactive, just as an object exposed to light does not start producing light. Radioactivity is the ability of a substance to emit high energy particles. When particles hit the target materials they may free other highly energetic particles. This ends shortly after the end of the exposure, much like objects stop reflecting light when the source is turned off and warm objects emit heat until they cool down but do not continue to produce their own heat. To modify a material so that it keeps emitting radiation (induce radiation) the atomic cores ([[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]) of the atoms in the target material must be modified.

It is impossible for food irradiators to induce radiation in a product. Irradiators emit [[electron]]s or [[photon]]s and the radiation is intrinsically radiated at precisely known strengths ([[wavelength]]s for photons, and speeds for electrons). These radiated particles at these strengths can never be strong enough to modify the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the targeted atom in the food, regardless of how many particles hit the target material, and radioactivity can not be induced without modifying the nucleus.&lt;ref name="EPA-food-safety"/&gt;

====Chemical changes====
Compounds known as free radicals form when food is irradiated. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., accept electrons) and some react very strongly. According to the free-radical theory of aging excessive amounts of these free radicals can lead to cell injury and cell death, which may contribute to many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rajamani Karthikeyan, Manivasagam T, Anantharaman P, Balasubramanian T, Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

{{further|Free-radical theory of aging|Oxidative stress}}

Most of the substances found in irradiated food are also found in food that has been subjected to other food processing treatments, and are therefore not unique. One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is nontoxic. When fatty acids are irradiated, a family of compounds called 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are produced. These are thought to be unique radiolytic products.
When irradiating food, all other chemicals occur in a lower or comparable frequency to other food processing techniques.&lt;ref name="JECFI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO1994"&gt;anon., Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food, WHO, Geneva, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EFSA2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1930|title=Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=9|issue=4|pages=1930|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the quantities in which they occur in irradiated food are lower or similar to the quantities formed in heat treatments.&lt;ref name="JECFI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EFSA2011" /&gt;

The radiation doses to cause toxic changes are much higher than the doses used during irradiation, and taking into account the presence of 2-ACBs along with what is known of free radicals, these results lead to the conclusion that there is no significant risk from radiolytic products.&lt;ref name="JFDiehl"/&gt;

====Food quality====
Ionizing radiation can change food quality but in general very high levels of radiation treatment (many thousands of gray) are necessary to adversely change nutritional content, as well as the sensory qualities (taste, appearance, and texture). Irradiation to the doses used commercially to treat food have very little negative impact on the sensory qualities and nutrient content in foods. When irradiation is used to maintain food quality for a longer period of time (improve the shelf stability of some sensory qualities and nutrients) the improvement means that more consumers have access to the original taste, texture, appearance, and nutrients.&lt;ref name="Antioxidant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="velvet bean" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changes in quality and nutrition depend on the degree of treatment and may vary greatly from food to food.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

There is some degradation of vitamins caused by irradiation, but is similar to or even less than the loss caused by other processes that achieve the same result. Other processes like chilling, freezing, drying, and heating also result in some vitamin loss.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

The changes in the flavor of fatty foods like meats, nuts and oils are sometimes noticeable, while the changes in lean products like fruits and vegetables are less so. Some studies by the irradiation industry show that for some properly treated fruits and vegetables irradiation is seen by consumers to improve the sensory qualities of the product compared to untreated fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

=====Quality Impact on Minimally Processed Vegetables=====

Because chemical agents do not provide efficient microbial reductions, watercress has been tested with gamma irradiation treatment in order to improve both safety and the shelf life of the product.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, B., Miller, F.

In a &lt;u&gt;Food Chemistry&lt;/u&gt; food journal, scientists studied the suitability of gamma irradiation of 1, 2, and 5 kGy for preserving quality parameters of the fresh cut watercress at around 4 degrees Celsius for 7 days.  They determined that a 2 kGy dose of irradiation was the dose that contained most similar qualities to non-stored control samples, which is one of the goals of irradiation.&lt;ref name="Antioxidant"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bahramikia S., Yazdanparast R. | year = 2010 | title = Antioxidant efficacy of Nasturtium officinale extracts using various in vitro assay systems | url = | journal = Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 283–290 | doi=10.1016/s2005-2901(10)60049-0| pmid = 21185544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  2 kGy preserved high levels of reducing sugars and favoured PUFA; while samples of the 5 kGy dose revealed high contents of sucrose and MUFA.

===Long-term impacts===
If the majority of food was irradiated at high-enough levels to significantly decrease its nutritional content, there would be an increased risk of developing nutritionally-based illnesses if additional steps, such as changes in eating habits, were not taken to mitigate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Louria |first=Donald B. |title=Food Irradiation: Unresolved Issues |date=August 1, 2001 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/3/378.full.pdf |journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]] |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=378–380 |pmid=11438907 |doi=10.1086/321907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, for at least three studies on cats, the consumption of irradiated food was associated with a [[Leukoencephalopathy|loss of tissue in the myelin sheath]], leading to reversible paralysis. Researchers suspect that reduced levels of vitamin A and high levels of free radicals may be the cause.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal| title=The experimental induction of leukoencephalomyelopathy in cats| pmid=19605900 | doi=10.1354/vp.08-VP-0336-C-FL | volume=46| issue=6 |vauthors=Caulfield CD, Kelly JP, Jones BR, Worrall S, Conlon L, Palmer AC, Cassidy JP | journal=Vet Pathol| pages=1258–69 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is thought to be specific to cats and has not been reproduced in any other animal. To produce these effects, the cats were fed solely on food that was irradiated at a dose at least five times higher than the maximum allowable dose.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

It may seem reasonable to assume that irradiating food might lead to radiation-tolerant strains, similar to the way that strains of bacteria have developed [[Antimicrobial resistance|resistance]] to antibiotics. Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species. This ensures that the process randomly destroys all members of a target species.&lt;ref name="D_values"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8846796/Prejeanpap.html |title=FOOD IRRADIATION: WHY AREN'T WE USING IT? |publisher=harvard.edu|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the more irradiation-tolerant members of the target species are not given any evolutionary advantage. Without evolutionary advantage, [[Selection (biology)|selection]] does not occur. As to the irradiation process directly producing mutations that lead to more virulent, radiation-resistant strains, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food found that there is no evidence; on the contrary, irradiation has been found to cause loss of virulence and infectivity, as mutants are usually less competitive and less adapted.&lt;ref name="SCF Revision"/&gt;

* India's National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) found an elevated rate of cells with more than one set of genes ([[polyploidy]]) in humans and animals when fed wheat that was irradiated recently (within 12 weeks). Upon analysis, scientists determined that the techniques used by the NIN allowed for too much human error and statistical variation; therefore, the results were unreliable. After multiple studies by independent agencies and scientists, no correlation between polyploidy and irradiation of food could be found.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

The indirect effects of irradiation are the concerns and benefits of irradiation that are related to how making food irradiation a common process will change the world, with emphasis on the system of food production.

If irradiation was to become common in the food handling process there would be a reduction of the prevalence of foodborne illness and potentially the eradication of specific pathogens.&lt;ref name="Ethiopia_Tsetse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/ethiopias-using-radiation-to-eradicate-tsetse-flies/1545361.html |title=Ethiopia Is Using Radiation to Eradicate Tsetse Flies |publisher=voanews.com |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies suggest that an increased rate of pathogen growth may occur when irradiated food is cross-contaminated with a pathogen, as the competing spoilage organisms are no longer present.&lt;ref name="ochratoxin"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=169778 |title=Production of ochratoxin A by Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL-3174 before and after exposures to 60Co irradiation |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–353 |date=March 31, 1976 |author1=Applegate |first1=K. L. |last2=Chipley |first2=J. R. |pmid=938031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This being said, cross contamination itself becomes less prevalent with an increase in usage of irradiated foods.&lt;ref name="Hospital Kitchen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ift.org/knowledge-center/read-ift-publications/science-reports/scientific-status-summaries/irradiation-of-food.aspx|title=SCIENTIFIC STATUS SUMMARY Irradiation of Food |publisher= Institute of Food Technologists’ Expert Panel on Food Safety and Nutrition in Food Technology |date=January 1998 |accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to remove bacterial contamination through post-processing by irradiation may reduce the fear of mishandling food which could cultivate a cavalier attitude toward hygiene and result in [[contamination|contaminants]] other than bacteria. However, concerns that the pasteurization of milk would lead to increased contamination of milk were prevalent when mandatory pasteurization was introduced, but these fears never materialized after adoption of this law. Therefore, it is unlikely for irradiation to cause an increase of illness due to nonbacteria-based contamination.&lt;ref name="E-coli Scare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/skstockgrowers/docs/beef_business_nov_2012/7 |title=Does the XL Foods E-coli Scare Make the Case for Irradiation? |publisher=issuu.com |date=February 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Up to the point where the food is processed by irradiation, the food is processed in the same way as all other food. To treat the food, they are exposed to a radioactive source, for a set period of time to achieve a desired dose. Radiation may be emitted by a radioactive substance, or by X-ray and electron beam accelerators. Special precautions are taken to ensure the food stuffs never come in contact with the radioactive substances and that the personnel and the environment are protected from exposure radiation.&lt;ref name="sterigenics"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.sterigenics.com/services/food_safety/food_irradiation__questions_answers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Irradiation treatments are typically classified by dose (high, medium, and low), but are sometimes classified by the effects of the treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2008.07.023|title=The RADURA-terminology and food irradiation|journal=Food Control|volume=20|issue=5|pages=526–528|year=2009|last1=Ehlermann|first1=Dieter A.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[radappertization]], [[radicidation]] and [[radurization]]). Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as "cold pasteurization"&lt;ref&gt;Cold Pasteurization of Food By Irradiation by Tim Roberts, Extension Specialist, Food Safety, Virginia Tech; Publication Number 458-300, posted August 1998 {{cite web |url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102010926/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-date=January 2, 2007 |title= |dead-url=bot: unknown |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} retrieved on November 15, 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102010926/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-date=January 2, 2007 |title= |dead-url=yes |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "electronic pasteurization"&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' The Truth about Irradiated Meat, CONSUMER REPORTS 34-37 (August 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; because ionizing the food does not heat the food to high temperatures during the process, and the effect is similar to heat pasteurization. The term "cold pasteurization" is controversial because the term may be used to disguise the fact the food has been irradiated and pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes.

Treatment costs vary as a function of dose and facility usage. A pallet or tote is typically exposed for several minutes to hours depending on dose. Low-dose applications such as disinfestation of fruit range between US$0.01/lbs and US$0.08/lbs while higher-dose applications can cost as much as US$0.20/lbs.&lt;ref name="ozone"/&gt;

=== Packaging ===
Food processors and manufacturers today struggle with using affordable, efficient packaging materials for irradiation based processing. The implementation of irradiation on prepackaged foods has been found to impact foods by inducing specific chemical alterations to the food packaging material that migrates into the food. [[Cross-link]]ing in various plastics can lead to physical and chemical modifications that can increase the overall molecular weight. On the other hand, chain scission is fragmentation of polymer chains that leads to a molecular weight reduction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Dosimetry===
The radiation absorbed dose is the amount energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The [[SI unit]] for dose is [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy or [[Joule|J]]/[[Kilogram|kg]]). [[Dosimeter]]s are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]], change measurable physical attributes to a degree that can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose ([[dosimetry]]) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/pdf/TRS409_scr.pdf |title=anon., Dosimetry for Food Irradiation, IAEA, Vienna, 2002, Technical Reports Series No. 409 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Mehta, Radiation Processing Dosimetry&amp;nbsp;– A practical manual, 2006, GEX Corporation, Centennial, US&lt;/ref&gt;

For purposes of legislation doses are divided into low (up to 1 kGy), medium (1 kGy to 10 kGy), and high-dose applications (above 10 kGy).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High-dose applications are above those currently permitted in the US for commercial food items by the FDA and other regulators around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nucleus.iaea.org/ifa/|title=Irradiated Food Authorization Database (IFA)|publisher=|date=|accessdate=March 19, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319174736/http://nucleus.iaea.org/ifa/|archivedate=March 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these doses are approved for non commercial applications, such as sterilizing frozen meat for [[NASA]] [[astronauts]] (doses of 44 kGy)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opa-fdir.html |title=U.

===Processes===

==== Gamma irradiation ====
Gamma irradiation is produced from the radioisotopes [[cobalt-60]] and [[caesium-137]], which are derived by neutron bombardment of cobalt-59 and as a nuclear source by-product, respectively.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cobalt-60 is the most common source of gamma rays for food irradiation in commercial scale facilities as it is water insoluble and hence has little risk of environmental contamination by leakage into the water systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As for transportation of the radiation source, cobalt-60 is transported in special trucks that prevent release of radiation and meet standards mentioned in the Regulations for Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials of the International Atomic Energy Act.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://foodirradiation.org/PDF/FIPA%20QandA.pdf|title=Food Irradiation Q and A|first=Food Irradiation Processing Alliance|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special trucks must meet high safety standards and pass extensive tests to be approved to ship radiation sources. Conversely, caesium-137, is water soluble and poses a risk of environmental contamination. Insufficient quantities are available for large scale commercial use. An incident where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html|title=Information Notice No. 89-82: RECENT SAFETY-RELATED INCIDENTS AT LARGE IRRADIATORS|date=|publisher=Nrc.gov|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to near elimination of this radioisotope.
[[File:Cobalt 60 stored under water when not in use.jpg|thumb|Cobalt 60 stored in Gamma Irradiation machine]]
Gamma irradiation is widely used due to its high penetration depth and dose uniformity, allowing for large-scale applications with high through puts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, gamma irradiation is significantly less expensive than using an X-ray source  In most designs, the radioisotope, contained in stainless steel pencils, is stored in a water-filled storage pool which absorbs the radiation energy when not in use. For treatment, the source is lifted out of the storage tank, and product contained in totes is passed around the pencils to achieve required processing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Electron beam ====
{{See also|Electron beam processing}}
Treatment of electron beams is created as a result of high energy electrons in an accelerator that generates electrons accelerated to 99% the speed of light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This system uses electrical energy and can be powered on and off. The high power correlates with a higher throughput and lower unit cost, but electron beams have low dose uniformity and a penetration depth of centimeters.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, electron beam treatment works for products that have low thickness.
[[File:Clam 2017 foto 2.jpg|thumb|Irradiated Guava: Spring Valley Fruits,Mexico]]

==== X-ray ====
[[X-ray]]s are produced by bombardment of dense target material with high energy accelerated electrons(this process is known as [[bremsstrahlung]]-conversion), giving rise to a continuous energy spectrum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Heavy metals, such as [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]], are used because of their high atomic numbers and high melting temperatures.Tantalum is usually preferred versus tungsten for industrial, large-area, high-power targets because it is more workable than tungsten and has a higher threshold energy for induced reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/41/097/41097063.pdf|title=RADIATION PROCESSING WITH HIGH-ENERGY X-RAYS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like electron beams, x-rays do not require the use of radioactive materials and can be turned off when not in use. X-rays have high penetration depths and high dose uniformity but they are a very expensive source of irradiation as only 8% of the incident energy is converted into X-rays.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Cost===
[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]
The cost of food irradiation is influenced by dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Forsythe and Evangel 1993, USDA 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1&amp;nbsp;million to $5&amp;nbsp;million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include

salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs.&lt;ref name="ozone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume2/irad2.html |title=The Use of Irradiation for Post-Harvest and Quarantine Commodity Control &amp;#124; Ozone Depletion – Regulatory Programs &amp;#124; U.S. EPA |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421093513/http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume2/irad2.html |archivedate=April 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;(Kunstadt et al., USDA 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.

== Public perception ==
Negative connotations associated with the word "radiation" are thought to be responsible for low consumer acceptance. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/SPP_Irradiation5.pdf|title=Food Irradiation Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irradiation has been approved by many countries. For example, in the U.S. the FDA has approved food irradiation for over fifty years. However, in the past decade the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated to prevent the spread of pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand, it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacturer and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufacturers to supplement their process with irradiation.&lt;ref name="NYT_P.O." /&gt; Nevertheless, food irradiation does take place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of dried herbs spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/biosafety/irradiation/reports_en | title=Annual Reports - Food Safety - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are some consumers who choose not to purchase irradiated food, a sufficient market has existed for retailers to have continuously stocked irradiated products for years.&lt;ref name="StewartPR"&gt;P. B. Roberts and Y. M. Hénon, Consumer response to irradiated food: purchase versus perception, Stewart Postharvest Review, September 2015, Vol. 11 (3:5), {{ISSN|1745-9656}}. http://www.foodirradiation.org/pages/Stewart/Roberts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When labeled irradiated food is offered for retail sale, these consumers buy it and re-purchase it, indicating that it is possible to successfully market irradiated foods, therefore retailers not stocking irradiated foods might be a major bottleneck to the wider adoption of irradiated foods.&lt;ref name="StewartPR" /&gt; It is however, widely believed that consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means&lt;ref name="Conley1992" /&gt; and some industry studies indicate the number of consumers concerned about the safety of irradiated food decreased between 1985 and 1995 to levels comparable to those of people concerned about food additives and preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Attitudes and Market Response to Irradiated Food, Author: Bruhn, Christine M.1 Journal of Food Protection, Volume 58, Number 2, February 1995, pp. 175–181(7), Publisher: International Association for Food Protection&lt;/ref&gt; Even though is it is untrue "People think the product is radioactive," said Harlan Clemmons, president of Sadex, a food irradiation company based in Sioux City, Iowa.&lt;ref name="NYT_spinach"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/health/policy/22spinach.html?ex=1377144000&amp;en=4d87f8791e3baa62&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Harris, Gardinier, "F.D.A. Allows Irradiation of Some Produce", ''The New York Times'', August 22, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these concerns and the increased cost of irradiated foods, there is not a widespread public demand for the irradiation of foods for human consumption.&lt;ref name="NYT_P.O." /&gt; Irradiated food does not become radioactive.

==Standards &amp; regulations==
The [[Codex Alimentarius]] represents the global standard for irradiation of food, in particular under the WTO-agreement. Regardless of treatment source, all processing facilities must adhere to safety standards set by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), Codex Code of Practice for the Radiation Processing of Food, [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC), and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Peter|date=December 2016|title=Food Irradiation: Standards, reguations, and world-wide trade|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|volume=129|pages=30–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, ISO 14470 and ISO 9001 provide in-depth information regarding safety in irradiation facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

All commercial irradiation facilities contain safety systems are designed to prevent exposure of personnel to radiation. The radiation source is constantly shielded by water, concrete, or metal. Irradiation facilities are designed with overlapping layers of protection, interlocks, and safeguards to prevent accidental radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, "melt-downs" do not occur in facilities because the radiation source gives off radiation and decay heat; however, the heat is not sufficient to melt any material.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Labeling===
[[File:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Radura symbol, as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]
The provisions of the [[Codex Alimentarius]] are that any "first generation" product must be labeled "irradiated" as any product derived directly from an irradiated raw material; for ingredients the provision is that even the last molecule of an irradiated ingredient must be listed with the ingredients even in cases where the unirradiated ingredient does not appear on the label. The RADURA-logo is optional; several countries use a graphical version that differs from the Codex-version. The suggested rules for labeling is published at CODEX-STAN&amp;nbsp;– 1 (2005),&lt;ref name="CX-label"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/32/CXS_001e.pdf |title=''GENERAL STANDARD FOR THE LABELLING OF PREPACKAGED FOODS''. CODEX STAN 1-1985. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the usage of the [[Radura]] symbol for all products that contain irradiated foods. The Radura symbol is not a designator of quality. The amount of pathogens remaining is based upon dose and the original content and the dose applied can vary on a product by product basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=179&amp;showFR=1 |title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union follows the Codex's provision to label irradiated ingredients down to the last molecule of irradiated food. The European Community does not provide for the use of the Radura logo and relies exclusively on labeling by the appropriate phrases in the respective languages of the Member States. The European Union enforces its irradiation labeling laws by requiring its member countries to perform tests on a cross section of food items in the market-place and to report to the European Commission. The results are published annually in the OJ of the European Communities.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/scientific_advices_reports_en.htm
 Expand "Food Irradiation Reports" and select respective annual report and language&lt;/ref&gt;

The US defines irradiated foods as foods in which the irradiation causes a material change in the food, or a material change in the consequences that may result from the use of the food. Therefore, food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement in the US. All irradiated foods must include a prominent Radura symbol followed in addition to the statement "treated with irradiation" or "treated by irradiation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bulk foods must be individually labeled with the symbol and statement or, alternatively, the Radura and statement should be located next to the sale container.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Packaging ===
Under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, irradiation of prepackaged foods requires premarket approval for not only the irradiation source for a specific food but also for the food packaging material. Approved packaging materials include various plastic films, yet does not cover a variety of polymers and adhesive based materials that have been found to meet specific standards. The lack of packaging material approval limits manufacturers production and expansion of irradiated prepackaged foods.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practices.|last=Fellows|first=P.J.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2018|isbn=9780081019078|location=|pages=279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food safety===
In 2003, the [[Codex Alimentarius]] removed any upper dose limit for food irradiation as well as clearances for specific foods, declaring that all are safe to irradiate. Countries such as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex without any reservation or restriction.

Standards that describe calibration and operation for radiation dosimetry, as well as procedures to relate the measured dose to the effects achieved and to report and document such results, are maintained by the [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM international) and are also available as ISO/ASTM standards.&lt;ref&gt;(see Annual Book of ASTM Standards, vol. 12.02, West Conshohocken, PA, US)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the rules involved in processing food are applied to all foods before they are irradiated.

====United States====
The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is the agency responsible for regulation of radiation sources in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Irradiation, as defined by the FDA is a "[[food additive]]" as opposed to a food process and therefore falls under the food additive regulations. Each food approved for irradiation has specific guidelines in terms of minimum and maximum dosage as determined safe by the FDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Packaging materials containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) amends these rules for use with meat, poultry, and fresh fruit.&lt;ref&gt;USDA/FSIS and USDA/APHIS, various final rules on pork, poultry and fresh fruits: Fed.Reg. 51:1769–1771 (1986); 54:387-393 (1989); 57:43588-43600 (1992); and others more&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has approved the use of low-level irradiation as an alternative treatment to pesticides for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of insect pests, including fruit flies and seed weevils. Under bilateral agreements that allows less-developed countries to earn income through food exports agreements are made to allow them to irradiate fruits and vegetables at low doses to kill insects, so that the food can avoid quarantine.

====European Union====
European law dictates that all member countries must allow the sale of irradiated dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings.&lt;ref name="EUregulation"&gt;EU: Food Irradiation&amp;nbsp;– Community Legislation http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/comm_legisl_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, these Directives allow Member States to maintain previous clearances food categories the EC's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had previously approved (the approval body is now the European Food Safety Authority). Presently, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom allow the sale of many different types of irradiated foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:283:0005:0005:EN:PDF |title=Official Journal of the European Communities. 24 November, 2009. ''List of Member States' authorisations of food and food ingredients which may be treated with ionizing radiation.'' |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before individual items in an approved class can be added to the approved list, studies into the toxicology of each of such food and for each of the proposed dose ranges are requested. It also states that irradiation shall not be used "as a substitute for hygiene or health practices or good manufacturing or agricultural practice". These Directives only control food irradiation for food retail and their conditions and controls are not applicable to the irradiation of food for patients requiring sterile diets.

Because of the [[Single Market]] of the EC any food, even if irradiated, must be allowed to be marketed in any other Member State even if a general ban of food irradiation prevails, under the condition that the food has been irradiated legally in the state of origin.

====Australia====
Australia banned irradiated cat food after a national scare where cats suffered from paralyzation after eating a specific brand of highly irradiated catfood for an extended period of time. The suspected culprit was malnutrition from consuming food depleted of Vitamin A by the irradiation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/catfood-irradiation-banned-as-pet-theory-proved-20090529-bq8h.html | title=Cat-food irradiation banned as pet theory proved| date=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-RSPCA-Australias-position-on-the-irradiation-of-imported-pet-food-products_307.html | title=RSPCA Australia knowledgebase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was linked only to a single batch of one brand's product and no illness was linked to any of that brand's other irradiated batches of the same product or to any other brand of irradiated cat food.

===Nuclear safety and security===
Interlocks and safeguards are mandated to minimize this risk. There have been radiation-related accidents, deaths, and injury at such facilities, many of them caused by operators overriding the safety related interlocks.&lt;ref name="Soreq"&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub925_web.pdf ''The Radiological Accident in Soreq'']&lt;/ref&gt; In a radiation processing facility, radiation specific concerns are supervised by special authorities, while "Ordinary" occupational safety regulations are handled much like other businesses.

The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions. The regulators enforce a safety culture that mandates that all incidents that occur are documented and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such incidents are studied by personnel at multiple facilities, and improvements are mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

In the US the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) regulates the safety of the processing facility, and the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) regulates the safe transport of the radioactive sources.

==Irradiated food supply==
As of 2010, the quantities of foods irradiated in Asia, the EU and the US were 285,200, 9,300, and 103,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |title=Food Irradiation in Asia, the European Union, and the United States |publisher=Japan Radioisotope Association |date=May 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043611/http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities in some countries use tests that can detect the irradiation of food items to enforce labeling standards and to bolster consumer confidence.&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, C.H., Gray, R., Stewart, E.M., Pearce, J., Detection methods for irradiated foods, Royal Society of Chemistry; Cambridge (GB); 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raffi, J., Delincée, H., Marchioni, E., Hasselmann, C., Sjöberg, A.-M., Leonardi, M., Kent, M., Bögl, K.-W., Schreiber, G., Stevenson, H., Meier, W., Concerted action of the community bureau of reference on methods of identification of irradiated foods; bcr information; European Commission; Luxembourg; 1994, 119 p.; EUR--15261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/377/CXS_231e.pdf |title=General Codex Methods for the Detection of Irradiated Foods, CODEX STAN 231-2001, Rev.1 2003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union monitors the market to determine the quantity of irradiated foods, if irradiated foods are labeled as irradiated, and if the irradiation is performed at approved facilities.

Irradiation of fruits and vegetables to prevent the spread of pest and diseases across borders has been increasing globally. In 2010, 18,446 tonnes of fruits and vegetables were irradiated in six countries for export quarantine control. 97% of this was exported to the United States.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |title=Food Irradiation in Asia, the European Union, and the United States |publisher=Japan Radioisotope Association |date=May 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043611/http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 103 000 tonnes of food products were irradiated on mainland United States in 2010. The three types of foods irradiated the most were spices (77.7%), fruits and vegetables (14.6%) and meat and poultry (7.77%). 17 953 tonnes of irradiated fruits and vegetables were exported to the mainland United States.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"/&gt; Mexico, the United States' state of Hawaii, Thailand, Vietnam and India export irradiated produce to the mainland U.S.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/ifruit08.pdf |title=APHIS Factsheet |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture • Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service |date=December 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/plant_imports/irradiation/downloads/InstructionsDomestic.pdf |title=Guidance for importing mangoes into the United States from Pakistan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico, followed by the United States' state of Hawaii, is the largest exporter of irradiated produce to the mainland U.S.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"/&gt;

In total, 6 876 tonnes of food products were irradiated in European Union countries in 2013; mainly in four member state countries: Belgium (49.4%), the Netherlands (24.4%), Spain (12.7%) and France (10.0%). The two types of foods irradiated the most were frog legs (46%), and dried herbs and spices (25%). There has been a decrease of 14% in the total quantity of products irradiated in the EU compared to the previous year 2012 (7 972 tonnes).&lt;ref name="EU food supply"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2015/EN/1-2015-69-EN-F1-1.PDF |title=Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Food and Food Ingredients Treated with Ionising Radiation FOR THE YEAR 2013 |publisher=European Commission |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSC is the three-dimensional extension of the two-dimensional Fourier ring correlation (FRC);&lt;ref name=vanHeel1982&gt;van Heel, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; also known as: spatial frequency correlation function.&lt;ref name=Saxton1982&gt;Saxton &amp; Baumeister, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==
:&lt;math&gt;
FSC(r) = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in r}{ F_1(r_i) \cdot F_2(r_i)^{\ast} }}
{\displaystyle\sqrt[2]{\sum_{r_i \in r}{ \left|F_1(r_i)\right|^2} \cdot \sum_{r_i \in r}{\left|F_2(r_i)\right|^2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for volume 1, &lt;math&gt;F_2^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of the structure Factor for volume 2, and &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the individual voxel element at radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Image Science's FSC: Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) of two 3D volumes | url=http://www.imagescience.de/fsc/ | work=fsc | publisher=Image Science | accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RF 3 - Phase Residual &amp; Fourier shell correlation | url=http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/man/rf3.html | work=SPIDER | publisher=Wadsworth Center | accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005&gt;van Heel &amp; Schatz, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, the FSC takes two three-dimensional data sets and converts them into a one-dimensional array.

The FSC originated in [[cryo-electron microscopy]] and gradually proliferated to other fields. To measure the FSC, two independently determined 3D volumes are required. In [[cryo-electron microscopy]], the two volumes are the result of two three-dimensional reconstructions, each based on half of the available data set. Typically, the even particle images form one half and the odd particles the other half of the data set. Most publications quote the FSC 0.5 resolution cutoff, which ''ad hoc'' criterion refers to when the correlation coefficient of the Fourier shells is equal to 0.5.&lt;ref name=Bottcher1997&gt;Böttcher et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frank2006&gt;Frank, 2006, p250-251&lt;/ref&gt; However, determining the resolution threshold remains a controversial issue: fixed-value thresholds were argued to be based on incorrect statistical assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005/&gt; Many other criteria using the FSC curve exist, including 3-σ criterion, 5-σ criterion, and the 0.143 cutoff. The half-bit criterion indicates at which resolution we have collected enough information to reliably interpret the 3-dimensional volume, and the (modified) 3-[[sigma]] criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise.&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005/&gt;

Stavrakopoulou has served as writer and presenter for a number of media productions relating to her scholarly interests. She contributed to [[Channel 4]]'s series ''The Bible: A History'' (2010), regarding the historicity of [[Moses]].&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt; Her first primetime presentation was a three-part television series for the [[BBC2]] ''The Bible's Buried Secrets'' (2011;&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; not to be confused with [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'s 2008 [[The Bible's Buried Secrets|programme of the same name]]).&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;

These popular presentations, while being widely presented (e.g., the [[BBC2]] production has been appearing in the U.S. as an offering of [[PBS]] stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wycc.org/schedule/#page=search&amp;day=20160330&amp;provider=Broadcast&amp;search=Did%20King%20David's%20Empire%20Exist%3F&amp;sorted=relevance|title=WYCC PBS Chicago - Schedule|author= WYCC Staff | date= 2016-04-03 | work=WYCC PBS Chicago | access-date=4 April 2016}}{{better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}}), have met with mixed and some skeptical reviews, both in the U.K. popular press,&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; and more broadly.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lucie-Smith, Alexander | date = 2011-03-23 | title=Theologians ought to love this BBC series on the Bible. Too bad it gives in to Dan Brown-style silliness | journal = [[The Catholic Herald]] | url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/03/23/theologians-ought-to-love-this-bbc-series-on-the-bible-too-bad-it-gives-in-to-dan-brown-style-silliness/ | access-date=17 March 2011 | quote = [Quoting subtitle, etc.] &lt;small&gt;In its closing moments the episode last night gave up fact for opinion. / …in the closing moments of the programme that scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of what was, in fact, mere opinion. First, the doctor suggested that the cult of the angels and the saints in contemporary Christianity was a hangover from polytheism. This is completely false. The Blessed Virgin is not some sort of lineal descendant of Asherah. The Blessed Virgin is a human being, not a goddess; she represents all that humanity is called to be; if she loses her humanity, she would have no appeal to her fellow human beings. But Mary is one of us—that is the whole point of her. Second, the doctor suggested that monotheism presents God as exclusively male, and men thus like God, which leads to the marginalisation and repression of women.With a charge like this, where can one start? The polytheistic Greeks and Romans denied females all political rights, despite the fact that Athens was under the protection of the goddess Athene, and Rome under the protection of Juno. The Julio-Claudian rulers claimed descent from Venus, but were not noted for their feminism. The idea that polytheism is more friendly to women is simply unsupported by the facts. It is easy to claim and sounds good, but as a serious thesis, it deserves to be dismissed. How on earth did it find itself in what purported to be a serious programme about the Bible?&lt;/small&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Alexander Lucie-Smith, consulting editor of ''The Catholic Herald'' and theologian, said that the BBC's ''…Buried Secrets'' series "is the sort of television programme that theologians ought to cherish…".&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He complained that in the second episode of the production, which addresses the origins of monotheism, that "…in [its] closing moments… scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of… mere opinion"; he took issue with Stavrakopoulou's suggestion that contemporary Christianity's views of Mary, saints, and angels were a holdover from the polytheistic religions, and that monotheism's presentation of God as exclusively male led to the marginalisation and repression of women.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He argues that the polytheistic Greeks and Romans religions featured female deities, but the cultures themselves denied females all political rights.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt;

[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]], Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of Interpretation [of biblical texts] at the [[University of Oxford]], in his ''Ethics in Ancient Israel'', comments thus on the conclusions and general disputes in one area that Stavrakopoulou is writing as theologian and historian:{{quote|[Stavrakopoulou] argues that the idea of the king and his entourage as worshipping in an official way—that is, in practice, in accordance with the kind of religious customs the prophets approved of—while the populace at large indulged in illicit cults, is wishful thinking. A particularly striking example is child sacrifice, which (she has argued) was regarded as normal by everyone in pre-exilic and exilic times, except prophets such as Jeremiah and Ezekial.&lt;ref&gt;On these points, Barton cites Stavrakopoulou's ''King Manasseh'' (2004) and her  "'Popular' Religion and 'Official' Religion: Practice, Perception, Portrayal" (in ''Religious Diversity,'' 2010), unfortunately, without page numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed the Old Testament itself, while strongly condemning such a practice, makes it abundantly clear that it was very common. The idea that it was popular rather than official reflects Old Testament condemnation, but probably not the reality on the ground at the time. Similarly, polytheism was fairly obviously common in pre-exilic Israel, but there is no particular reason to think it was more common among 'the people' than in the king's palace and, indeed, in the temple. / ''These matters are widely disputed,'' but so-called popular religion may well have been much nearer to official religion…&lt;ref name = BartonEthics2014&gt;{{cite book |  author = Barton, John | year = 2014 | title = Ethics in Ancient Israel | chapter =  | ref =  | location = Oxford, ENG | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0199660433 | pages = 88f  | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0199660433 | access-date = 3 April 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While this excerpt is not entirely an independent view—[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton]] is a fellow, more senior [[Oxonian]] who has collaborated with Stavrakopoulous (see '''Books''' subsection above)—it nevertheless indicates, according to this sympathetic colleague, that there is no preponderance of academic opinion on this matter, about which Stavrakopoulous writes (i.e., it is, in Barton's representation, "widely disputed").&lt;/ref&gt; [break in paragraph indicated, emphasis regarding disputed nature of views, added]}}

An '''in-service program''' is a professional training or staff development effort, where professionals are trained and discuss their work with others in their peer group.

It is a key component of [[continuing medical education]] for [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, and other medical professionals. It is also common among public servants including educators&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsaw.com/news/education/headlines/104310863.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and public safety officials.

In-service program also refers to some programs offered to enlisted members of the [[military]] while they are in service.

In-service programs also refers to [[educator]]s, where they discuss methods and cases and work loads.

Dr. '''Lilli Nielsen''' (''née'' '''Reker''') (b. December 21, 1926, [[Rønne]], [[Bornholm]];&lt;ref name="lilliworkscv"&gt;[http://www.lilliworks.com/dr_nielsen_cv.htm About Dr. Lilli Nielsen:CV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006092851/http://www.lilliworks.com/dr_nielsen_cv.htm |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; † June 24, 2013, [[Kolding]], Denmark) was a Danish [[psychologist]] in the field of teaching blind children and those with multiple disabilities.  She has written several books on the subject.  
* '''Are You Blind?''' - This book focuses on the adult's interactions when working with children/adults with multiple disabilities.  The needs of individuals with autistic-like tendencies or who exhibit self-injurious or aggressive behaviors are specifically addressed.  The Five Phases of Educational Treatment are presented in detail - a technique used to build trust and encourage skill attainment.  
* '''Early Learning Step By Step''' - Parents, educators, and therapists who work with children and adults with multiple special needs will gain an understanding of how all individuals achieve readiness skills for learning.  Environmental intervention can facilitate skill attainment through Active Learning equipment and techniques, including learning to move, coordinate hand movement, learning to chew/eat, dress/undress, and play constructively.
* '''Educational Approaches''' - This book is a collection of Dr. Nielsen's papers, articles, essays and research ideas. It explains how she expanded the educational approaches for children and infants with vision impairments.
* '''Functional Scheme''' - This functional skill assessment and learning reassessment tool was developed by Dr. Nielsen to meet the needs of children and adults who are functioning at a developmental level under 48 months.  The purpose of the tool is to create the best possible basis for developing an appropriate learning program for the learner.
* '''Space and Self''' - Dr. Nielsen details the meaning of spatial relations as it applies to the development of self-identity.  The development and use of the “Little Room” is provided, with particular emphasis on promoting object conceptualization, self-identification and spatial relations in individuals with multiple special needs.
* '''Spatial Relations in Congenitally Blind Infants''' - This is Dr. Nielsen's dissertation on her scientific study, which resulted in the design of the "Little Room."  The study investigated whether a specially designed environment would facilitate the development of early spatial relations in congenitally blind infants.
* '''The Comprehending Hand''' - The ability to grasp is of fundamental importance for a child with special needs to get into contact with his/her surroundings and to enhance the development of the other senses. The book gives practical hints on how to adapt materials and surroundings to stimulate and encourage fine motor skill development.
* '''The FIELA Curriculum – 730 Learning Environments''' - Developed by Dr. Nielsen, The Flexible Individual Enriched Level Appropriate Curriculum offers 730 examples of developmentally appropriate activities for children and adults with multiple disabilities.  This book is an "appetizer" to the thousands of learning environments and activities a child or adult needs to develop and learn to his potential.  (An optional Manual with Moveable Cards provides an instantly usable programming option.)
She was the second of seven children, four of whom were born blind.  When she was seven she was charged with the responsibility of taking care of her blind younger brother.&lt;ref name="lilliworks"&gt;[http://www.lilliworks.com/about_dr__lilli_nielsen.htm About Dr. Lilli Nielsen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529103857/http://www.lilliworks.com/about_dr__lilli_nielsen.htm |date=2007-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a preschool teacher, then worked in a hospital, became a psychologist, and eventually was hired to teach the blind.&lt;ref name="lilliworks"/&gt;

In 1988 she earned a [[PhD]] in [[psychology]] at the [[University of Århus]].&lt;ref name="lilliworkscv"/&gt;

Lilli Nielsen has worked as special education adviser at Refsnaesskolen, National Institute to Blind and Partially Sighted Children and Youth in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsbvi.edu/resources/2588-an-introduction-to-dr-lilli-nielsens-active-learning An Introduction to Dr. Lilli Nielsen's Active Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been awarded the Knight [[Order of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name="lilliworks"/&gt;

Dr. Lilli Nielsen died on the June 24, 2013, at the public hospital of Kolding after a short period of illness (pneumonia).

== Philosophy of Active Learning for Individuals with Visual Impairments ==
The Active Learning approach emphasizes that all individuals learn best by active participation.  All activity, especially in the earliest stages of development, actually "wires our brains" and establishes critical foundational concepts and skills necessary for all future learning.

Individuals with multiple disabilities (cerebral palsy, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, autism, hearing impairment, etc.) are at great risk from developing reliance on others to interact with the world around them.  They learn to be a passive rather than active participant, waiting for adults to provide activity rather than seeking it out on their own.  Children and adults with special needs often develop stereotypical or aggressive behaviors in order to communicate with others or cope within the environments in which they are placed.  Active Learning recognizes that every child/adult with special needs is unique.  The programming and intervention for facilitating learning must reflect this individuality.

Active Learning emphasizes creating a developmentally appropriate and enriched environment so that children and adults with multiple special needs become active learners.

Dr. Nielsen's Active Learning approach addresses the breakdowns that can occur at the earliest stages of development due to an individual's inability to access the world because of disabilities including visual impairment, cerebral palsy, cognitive disabilities, hearing impairment, autism and other disabilities.

=="Little Room"==
One of her most famous ideas is that of the "little room."  This is a box that is laid over a blind or severely disabled child that has toys and other stimuli hanging from it.  The child can then explore and play with the toys. Most will vocalize, even for the first time, due to the superior acoustics of the Little Room.  As Nielsen wrote: "The purpose of the 'Little Room' is to facilitate blind children's achievement of spatial relations and reaching behaviour, but it can also be of considerable help for sighted low functioning children."&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, L. (1992).  Space and Self.  Copenhagen, Denmark: Sikon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

=="HOPSA-dress"==

The HOPSA-dress provides vertical orientation, without the need for weightbearing, to children with multiple disabilities.  Items with interesting textures can be placed near the feet for tactile stimulation.  Later, the pulley system can be adjusted so that the child can bear weight gradually, at their own pace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17930">{{main article|Altitudinal zonation}}

The climate and ecology of different locations on the globe naturally separate into [[life zones]], depending on [[elevation]], location, and [[latitude]]. The generally strong dependency on elevation is known as [[altitudinal zonation]]: the average temperature of a location decreases as the elevation increases.

The general effect of elevation depends on atmospheric physics. However, the specific climate and ecology of any particular location depends on specific features of that location. This article provides a '''list of life zones by region''', in order to illustrate the features of life zones for regions around the globe.

In the altitudes between 3,400 meters (11,000 feet) and 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) some of the most extreme examples of adaptations can be found. At altitudes below 3,400 meters (12,000 feet) the daily temperature fluctuations are less extreme, the average daily temperature steadily increases, and the growth forms and ecology of the ''[[Dendrosenecio|Dendroseneico]]'' reflect the increased influence of [[biotic factor]]s (such as competition for light) over [[Abiotic components|abiotic factor]]s (such as nightly frost).&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;Knox, Eric B.

== Jade Dragon Snow Mountains ==
The Jade Dragon Snow Mountains contain the glacier nearest of the Equator on the North Hemisphere. The landmarks 4,506 m and 4,680 m at the end of the glacier can be achieved through the cable car from Ganhaizi (Tibetan for dry lake, a grassland with conifers at 3,400 m). The mountain desert begins around 4,000 m. The [[Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas|Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan]] ([[List of World Heritage Sites in Asia and Australasia|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) encompasses the watershed areas of the [[Yangtze]] (Jinsha), [[Mekong]] ([[Lancang River|Lan Cang]]) and [[Salween]] (Nujiang) rivers and is the joint of the [[Palearctic ecozone]] and the [[Indomalaya ecozone]].

The '''Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Kolloid- und Grenzflächenforschung'') is located in Potsdam-Golm Science Park in [[Golm (Potsdam)|Golm]], [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]]. It was founded in 1990 as a successor of the Institute for Physical Chemistry and for Organic Chemistry, both in [[Berlin]]-[[Adlershof]], and for Polymer Chemistry in [[Teltow]]. In 1999, it transferred to newly constructed extension facilities in Golm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/history |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft'').

==Research==
Being part of the Max Planck Society, the institute examines [[nanostructure|nano-]] and [[microstructure]]s specifically [[colloids]] in which many are found in nature. With discoveries, scientists create tiny [[apatite|apatite crystals]] in [[bones]], [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]s formed out of [[membrane]]s, pores in membranes for [[fuel cells]] and [[microcapsules]] as vehicles for [[medical drugs]] - all are larger than an [[atom]], yet too small to be seen with the [[naked eye]]. The scientists at the Potsdam-based Institute endeavor to understand how they are composed and how they work in order to imitate behavior in new materials or in [[vaccines]], for example. Understanding the function of these structures can also help to identify the causes of certain diseases that occur when the folding of membranes or the transport of materials in cells fails to work properly.

==Departments==

===Colloid Chemistry===
The Colloid Chemistry department, headed by Markus Antonietti, deals with the synthesis of various colloidal structures in the nanometer range. This includes inorganic and metallic nanoparticles, polymers and peptide structural units, their micelles and organised phases, as well as emulsions and foams. Colloid chemistry is able to create materials with a structural hierarchy through appropriate functionalized colloids. This creates new characteristics through the "teamwork" of the functional groups. With appropriate architecture, these colloids can fulfill very specialized tasks. Single molecular systems cannot do this, due to their lack of complexity. An example for this is skin: There is no synthetic material which is as soft and simultaneously so tear-resistant and yet is made mainly of water. The secret of this also lies in the interaction between three components (collagen, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycan). This unusual combination of characteristics is only made possible by forming a superstructure "in a team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/145657/Colloid_Chemistry |title=Colloid chemistry |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomaterials===
The Department of Biomaterials, headed by [[Peter Fratzl]], focuses on interdisciplinary research in the field of biological and biomimetic materials. The emphasis is on understanding how the mechanical or other physical properties are governed by structure and composition and how they adopt to environmental conditions. Furthermore, research on natural materials (such as bone or wood) has potential applications in many fields. First, design concepts for new materials may be improved by learning from Nature. Second, the understanding of basic mechanisms by which the structure of bone or connective tissue is optimized opens the way for studying diseases and, thus, for contributing to diagnosis and development of treatment strategies. A third option is to use structures grown by Nature and transform them by physical or chemical treatment into technically relevant materials (biotemplating). Given the complexity of natural materials, new approaches for structural characterization are needed. Some of these are further developed in the Department, in particular for studying hierarchical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/133578/Biomaterials |title=Biomaterials |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory and Bio-Systems===
The Department of Theory and Bio-Systems, headed by Reinhard Lipowsky, investigates the structure and dynamics of molecules, colloids and nanoparticles in biological and biomimetic systems. The molecular building blocks of these systems assemble "by themselves" and form a variety of supramolecular nanostructures, which then interact to produce even larger structures and networks. These complex processes represent hidden dimensions of selforganization since they are difficult to observe on the relevant length and time scales.

Current research focuses on molecular recognition, energy conversion and transport by molecular motors, dynamics of transcription and translation, as well as self-organization of filaments and membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/164482/Theory_Bio-Systems |title=Theory bio-systems |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaces===
The Department of Interfaces, headed by Helmuth Möhwald, is primarily motivated to understand molecular interfaces and to relate this to colloidal systems which are by nature determined by the large surface/volume ratio. Consequently, the strength of the department in characterizing planar or quasi-planar interfaces has been increased and in addition it has been tried successfully to transfer this knowledge to curved interfaces. From this we have again learned about planar interfaces since surfaces could be studied by techniques requiring large surface area (NMR, DSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/159235/Interfaces |title=Interfaces |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomolecular Systems===
The researchers in the Biomolecular Systems department, headed by Peter H. Seeberger, are using new methods for synthesizing sugar chains. Until recently most of the known naturally occurring sugars were those that supply energy to organisms such as [[sucrose]] (household sugar) and [[starch]] (in plants). However, the complex sugar molecules, which belong to the carbohydrate, are also involved in many biological processes. They cover all cells in the human body and play a crucial part in molecular identification of cell surfaces for example in infections, immune reactions and cancer metastases. Complex sugars are omnipresent as cell coatings in nature and can therefore also be used for vaccine development, e.g. against malaria. Carbohydrates are thus of significant interest for medicine; the major significance of sugar residues on the surfaces of cells for biology and medicine has only been recognized during the past approximately 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/145657/Colloid_Chemistry |title=Biomolecular systems |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently a chemical synthesis method to create biologically relevant carbohydrates with a known structure in large quantities and for biological, pharmaceutical and medical research was lacking. Now, these gaps can be closed with the development of the first automated synthesis apparatus that can link sugar molecules with other sugars or also molecules.

==Organization==
The Golm-based institute has a total of 358 employees, including 91 scientists and 99 junior scientists and researchers, 6 apprentices, 138 employees paid with third-party funds and 24 guest researchers.

In March 2006 the [[Washington Monthly]] awarded ''Mine Safety and Health News'' its Monthly Journalism Award which is presented each month to "one or more newspaper, magazine, radio, or television stories (or series of stories) that demonstrate a commitment to the public interest ... particularly reporting that explains the successes and failures of government agencies at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ellen+Smith%3A+Mine+Safety+and+Health+News.-a0142574083|title=Ellen Smith: Mine Safety and Health News.|work=Washington Monthly|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its staff was awarded the Society of Professional Journalist [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] for Public Service in Newsletter Journalism in July 2007, for the coverage of the [[Sago Mine disaster|2006 Sago Mine Disaster]] in [[West Virginia]] that left 12 miners dead. "The judges lauded their coverage as informative and complete and in no way was led by the 'disaster pack' of national media covering the disaster. It provides its readers with insights and details not found in other coverage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=SDX Awards: Public Service in Newsletter Journalism|journal=Quill|date=July 2007|url=http://www.spj.org/quill_issue.asp?ref=1172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was again awarded the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service in Newsletter Journalism in July 2008, for the coverage of the [[Crandall Canyon Mine|2007 Crandall Canyon Mine Disaster]] in [[Utah]] that ultimately left 9 people dead. The judges said they "provided much needed context ... including information about the mine owner's controversial history with safety violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Winner: Mine Safety &amp; Health News|journal=Quill|date=July 2008|url = http://www.spj.org/quill_issue.asp?ref=1365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was awarded the  Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service in Newsletter Journalism in 1989 when she was the editor of the former publication Mine Regulation Reporter, for coverage of the 1989 Pyro Mining Co. Williams Station Mine Disaster.

In 2008, an editorial entitled "High Negligence and Reckless Disregard," was given the Magnum Opus "Gold Award" for best signed editorial or essay. In it, Smith was highly critical of the Mine Safety and Health Administration allowing reporters and camera crews into the Crandall Canyon Mine just days after a disaster trapped two miners and the mine was unstable. Four days after her editorial was published, the mine experienced a huge coal burst that killed 6 rescuers. 

''Mine Safety and Health News'' has also received several APEX Awards for Publication Excellence (1996, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2015).

==Special Projects==
Worked with Global News - 16X9 program highlighting concerns in the Donkin Mine Project in Nova Scotia, where a company owned by U.S. coal operator Chris Cline seeks to mine metallurgical coal almost 2,000 feet under the Atlantic Ocean. Smith pointed to problems in Cline's mines in the U.S., specifically the MC#1 Mine that has continuous and recurring serious mining violations. Smith also questioned the "due diligence" in the report prepared for the Canadian government, which seems to gloss over some of the more serious problems with Cline's mine in the United States.  See: http://globalnews.ca/news/2654293/donkin-coal-mine-in-cape-breton-to-open-this-summer-amid-safety-concerns-from-critics/

Worked in partnership with National Public Radio finding hundreds of mine operators owing millions in delinquent mine safety penalties. While this was a story covered for years by Mine Safety and Health News, NPR's team was able to download massive data sets from the government to show that mines with delinquent MSHA penalties had accident rates 50% to 70% higher than mines who pay their fines. See: http://www.minesafety.com/investigation-finds-70-million-in-unpaid-fines-leaves-deadly-and-crippling-legacies/

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3673">The '''National Information Assurance Partnership''' (NIAP) is a [[United States]] [[government of the United States|government]] initiative to meet the security testing needs of both [[information technology]] consumers and producers that is operated by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and was originally a joint effort between NSA and the [[NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).

== Purpose ==

The long-term goal of NIAP is to help increase the level of trust consumers have in their information systems and networks through the use of cost-effective security testing, evaluation, and validation programs. In meeting this goal, NIAP seeks to:

*Promote the development and use of evaluated IT products and systems
*Champion the development and use of national and international standards for IT security
**[[Common Criteria]]
*Foster research and development in IT security requirements definition, test methods, tools, techniques, and assurance metrics
*Support a framework for international recognition and acceptance of IT security testing and evaluation results
*Facilitate the development and growth of a commercial security testing industry within the U.S.

== Services ==
*[[Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme]] (CCEVS)
*Product / System Configuration Guidance
*Product and [[Protection Profile]] Evaluation
*Consistency Instruction Manuals

== NIAP Validation Body ==
The principal objective of the NIAP Validation Body is to ensure the provision of competent IT security evaluation and validation services for both government and industry. The Validation Body has the ultimate responsibility for the operation of the CCEVS in accordance with its policies and procedures, and where appropriate: interpret and amend those policies and procedures. The NSA is responsible for providing sufficient resources to the Validation Body so that it may carry out its responsibilities.

The Validation Body is led by a Director and Deputy Director selected by NSA management. The Director of the Validation Body reports to the NIAP Director for administrative and budgetary matters and to NSA certificate-issuing authorities for CCEVS related operational matters. In general, the Director and Deputy Director serve a two-year term of service. This term of service may be extended at the discretion of NSA management. There are also a significant number of technical and administrative support personnel required to provide a full range of validation services for the sponsors of evaluations and the Common Criteria Testing Laboratories (CCTL). These personnel include validators, technical experts in various technology cells, and senior members of the technical staff and the IT security community on the oversight board.

The Validation Body ensures that appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect the interests of all parties within the CCEVS participating in the process of IT security evaluation. Any dispute brought forth by a participating party, (i.e., sponsor of an evaluation, product or Protection Profile developer or CCTL), concerning the operation of the CCEVS or any of its associated activities shall be referred to the Validation Body for resolution. In disputes involving the Validation Body, NSA management will attempt to resolve the dispute through procedures agreed upon by the two organizations.

'''Neurobiotics''' is a loose term without strict definition referring to the study of the [[nervous system]] in conjunction with [[technology]].&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;Kandel, Eric R. (2000). Principles of Neural Science. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill Medical. {{ISBN|0-8385-7701-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance in the field of neurobiotics is the [[brain]] and its direct interaction with [[computer systems]], as well as methods of externally simulating the brain. Also, a large branch of neurobiotics commonly called [[neurosimulation]], concerns the attempt to produce [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]] by combining [[neural networks]] and the basics of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Enquist, Magnus. (2005). Neural Networks and Animal Behavior. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-09633-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term neurobiotics has no documented first use and several sources claim to have 'coined' the term.&lt;ref name="neurobiotics.com"&gt;[http://www.neurobiotics.com/ travel media shopping computers hardware at neurobiotics.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencemuseum.com"&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/neurobotics/ Science Museum | Antenna | NEURObotics...the future of thinking?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; But most likely the term has been invented countless times due to both its Latinate nature and the way the roots have been used in other terms. ''Neur''- meaning nerve and biotic meaning of or related to life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kent.k12.wa.us/ksd/MA/resources/greek_and_latin_roots/transition.html Greek and Latin base transition page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The technological overtones behind neurobiotics probably simply come from the fact that the term sounds modern, most easily explained by [[memetic]] theories.

The term is often used only to refer to individual projects or companies, and most who use it are unaware that the term is commonly used.&lt;ref name="sciencemuseum.com" /&gt; There is no official definition for the term, and since it is frequently reinvented by people, it can refer to a wide range of ideas, concepts, studies and goals. The most definitive source for the term is probably from the private research company [[NDT Neurobiotics]] with branches in the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and [[Carnegie Mellon]]. NDT Neurobiotics' primary focus is the creation of strong AI, with a stated company goal of passing the [[Turing test]]. They also invest significantly into studies that they hope will lead to [[direct neural interface]].&lt;ref name="ndtneurobiotics.com"&gt;http://www.ndtneurobiotics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magical connotations==

The term neurobiotics has been used with 'magical' overtones, referring to areas such as mind reading and animating inanimate objects. There are also connection concerning the idea that time is relative (in the non-Einsteinian meaning) and that life (and nerves) can control time to an extent. These uses are nonstandard and probably have no connection to the scientific uses.

==Potential technology==

The study of neurobiotics is only very loosely bound, and the technology far off. Much of the technology that advocates hope for are only loose concepts that seem closer to the realm of science fiction than science. The main technological areas that neurobiotics targets are direct neural interfaces, strong AI and [[neurostimulator]]s which affect previously inaccessible areas of our cognition such as creativity and motivation. [[Virtual reality]], created through direct stimulation of the input nerves and directly reading the output nerves is also a commonly hoped for technology.

==Active Research==

Thousands of research labs are probing areas that could be included in the umbrella of neurobiotics.&lt;ref&gt;Eslinger, Paul J. (2005). Neuropsychological Interventions: Clinical Research and Practice. The Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although very few use the term neurobiology. Dr. Jeffrey R. Johnson, chiropractor, has used the term for his practice since 2002, but uses a nonstandard definition.&lt;ref name="neurobiotics.com" /&gt; NDT Neurobiotics, founded in 2000, also uses the term and with one of the largest budgets in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="ndtneurobiotics.com" /&gt; is probably the leader in the field (although data from NDT Neurobiotics has yet to be released). Allan Snyder at the [[Centre for the Mind]] in Australia is working on increasing humans 'savant' skills by "zapping their brain with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS)."&lt;ref name="sciencemuseum.com" /&gt; He also coined the term [[champion mindset]].

==Morality==

Neurobiotics isn't currently in the public spotlight, but if and when it is it will likely be bombarded with the same moral qualms as [[genetic engineering]] as well as [[xenophobia]]. The question of whether or not we have the right to tamper with our brains as well as the question of whether or not various forms of strong AI have the right to live have been frequented by science fiction writers, but will probably be a long time before hitting the public forums. Proponents of neurobiotics, such as [[James Mikal]], are hoping that by the time technological achievements can be made, the "...tides of xenophobia and conservatism will have turned."&lt;ref name="ndtneurobiotics.com" /&gt;

Opponents, such as [[Dr. Nathan Grimmauld]], are highly opposed to anything to do with the tampering of the mind and state that it "...could be the end of human civilization as we know ... [strong AI] is a recipe for global disaster unlike any other!"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==The future==

The feasibility of neurobiotics has yet to be proven, but if key research breakthroughs happen, it is expected that neurobiotics will be one of the biggest industries around 2070, with everything from entertainment to investment being handled by various neurobiotic technologies.&lt;ref name="Kandel" /&gt;

Proponents hope that neurobiotics will replace the computer age with the [[Artificial neural network|neurocomputer]] age.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16362">An '''oligotroph''' is an [[organism]] that can live in an environment that offers very low levels of [[nutrients]]. They may be contrasted with [[copiotrophs]], which prefer nutritionally rich environments. Oligotrophs are characterized by slow growth, low rates of metabolism, and generally low population density.

The adjective ''oligotrophic'' may be used to refer to environments that offer little to sustain life, organisms that survive in such environments, or the adaptations that support survival. [[etymology|Etymologically]], the word "oligotroph" is a combination of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''oligos'' (ὀλίγος)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)li/gos|ὀλίγος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "few" and the adjective ''trophikos'' (τροφικός)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|trofiko/s|τροφικός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;) meaning "feeding".

Oligotrophic environments include deep oceanic sediments, caves, glacial and polar ice, deep subsurface soil, aquifers, ocean waters, and leached soils.

Examples of oligotrophic organisms are the cave-dwelling [[olm]]; the bacterium, ''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'', which is the most abundant organism in the oceans with an estimated 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; individuals in total; and the [[lichen]]s with their extremely low [[metabolic rate]].

==Plant adaptations==
Plant adaptations to oligotrophic soils provide for greater and more efficient nutrient uptake, reduced nutrient consumption, and efficient nutrient storage. Improvements in nutrient uptake are facilitated by root adaptations such as [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[root nodule]]s, [[mycorrhiza]]e and [[cluster roots]]. Consumption is reduced by very slow growth rates, and by efficient use of low-availability nutrients; for example, the use of highly available ions to maintain [[turgor pressure]], with low-availability nutrients reserved for the building of tissues. Despite these adaptations, nutrient requirement typically exceed uptake during the growing season, so many oligotrophic plants have the ability to store nutrients, for example, in trunk tissues, when demand is low, and remobilise them when demand increases.

== Oligotrophic environments ==
'''Oligotrophs''' occupy environments where the available nutrients offer little to sustain life. The term “'''oligotrophic'''” is commonly used to describe terrestrial and aquatic environments with very low concentrations of nitrates, iron, phosphates, and carbon sources.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=Arthur L.|title=Oligotrophs versus copiotrophs|journal=BioEssays|date=July 2001|volume=23|issue=7|page=657-661|doi=10.1002/bies.1091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extremophiles Where it all Began|last1=Horikoshi|first1=Koki|date=2016|publisher=Springer Japan|year=|isbn=978-4-431-55407-3|location=Tokyo, Japan|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligotrophs have acquired survival mechanisms that involve the expression of genes during periods of low nutrient conditions, which has allowed them to find success in various environments. Despite the capability to live in low nutrient concentrations, oligotrophs may find difficulty surviving in nutrient-rich environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Antarctica ===
Antarctic life offers very little to sustain life as most organisms are not well adapted to live under nutrient-limiting conditions and cold temperatures (lower than 5 °C). As such, these environments display a large abundance of [[Psychrophile|psychrophiles]] that are well adapted to living in an Antarctic biome. Most oligotrophs live in lakes where water helps support biochemical processes for growth and survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anesio|first1=Alexandre M.|last2=Laybourn-Parry|first2=Johanna|title=Glaciers and ice sheets as a biome|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=April 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=219–225|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some documented examples of oligotrophic environments in Antarctica:

'''[[Lake Vostok]]''', a freshwater lake which has been isolated from the world beneath 4 km (2.5 mi) of Antarctic ice is frequently held to be a primary example of an oligotrophic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Race against time for raiders of the lost lake |date=2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=469 |issue= 7330|pages=275 |doi=10.1038/469275a |pmid=21248808|bibcode=2011Natur.469..275S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of ice samples showed ecologically separated microenvironments. Isolation of microorganisms from each microenvironment led to the discovery of a wide range of different microorganisms present within the ice sheet.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Elia|first1=T.|last2=Veerapaneni|first2=R.|last3=Rogers|first3=S.

It is proposed that low competitive selection against ''Daphniopsis studeri'' has allowed the species to survive long enough to reproduce in nutrient limiting environments.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Australia===
The sandplains and [[laterite|lateritic soils]] of southern [[Western Australia]], where an extremely thick [[craton]] has precluded any geological activity since the [[Cambrian]] and there has been no [[glaciation]] to renew soils since the [[Carboniferous]]. Thus, soils are extremely nutrient-poor and most vegetation must use strategies such as [[cluster root]]s to gain even the smallest quantities of such nutrients as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]].

The vegetation in these regions, however, is remarkable for its [[biodiversity]], which in places is as great as that of a [[tropical rainforest]] and produces some of the most spectacular wildflowers in the world. It is however, severely threatened by [[climate change in Australia|climate change]] which has moved the winter rain belt south, and also by clearing for [[agriculture]] and through use of [[fertilizer]]s, which is primarily driven by low land costs which make farming economic even with yields a fraction of those in Europe or North America.

===South America===
An example of oligotrophic soils are those on white-sands, with [[soil pH]] lower than 5.0, on the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] basin on northern [[Amazon Basin|Amazonia]] that house very low-diversity, extremely fragile forests and savannahs drained by [[blackwater river]]s; dark water colour due to high concentration of [[tannin]]s, [[humic acid]]s and other organic compounds derived from the very slow decomposition of plant matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janzen |first=D.

===Ocean===
In the [[ocean]], the [[Oceanic gyre|subtropical gyres]] north and south of the [[equator]] are regions in which the [[nutrient]]s required for [[phytoplankton]] growth (for instance, [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicic acid]]) are strongly depleted all year round.  These areas are described as oligotrophic and exhibit low surface [[chlorophyll]].  They are occasionally described as "ocean deserts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2008/20080305_oceandesert.html | date=2008-03-05| accessdate=2009-07-17 | publisher=[[NOAA]] | title=Study Shows Ocean "Deserts" are Expanding }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oligotrophic soil environments ===
The oligotrophic soil environments include agricultural soil, frozen soil etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Various factors, such as [[decomposition]], soil structure, [[Fertilizer|fertilization]] and [[temperature]], can affect the nutrient-availability in the soil environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Generally, the nutrient becomes less available along the depth of the soil environment, because on the surface, the organic compounds decomposed from the plant and animal [[debris]] are consumed quickly by other microbes, resulting in the lack of nutrient in the deeper level of soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the metabolic waste produced by the microorganisms on the surface also causes the accumulation of toxic chemicals in the deeper area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, oxygen and water are important for some metabolic pathways, but it is difficult for water and oxygen to diffuse as the depth increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bacteria in oligotrophic environments: Starvation-survival life style|last=Morita|first=Richard Yukio|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=1997|isbn=9780412106613|location=New York|pages=50 - 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some factors, such as soil aggregates, pores and extracellular enzymes, may help water, oxygen and other nutrients diffuse into the soil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, the presence of mineral under the soil provides the alternative sources for the species living in the oligotrophic soil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In terms of the agricultural lands, the application of fertilizer has a complicated impact on the source of carbon, either increasing or decreasing the organic carbon in the soil.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finn|first=Damien|last2=Kopittke|first2=Peter M.|last3=Dennis|first3=Paul G.|last4=Dalal|first4=Ram C.|title=Microbial energy and matter transformation in agricultural soils|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071716304771|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=111|pages=176–192|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Collimonas]]'' is one of the species that are capable of living in the oligotrophic soil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One common feature of the environments where ''[[Collimonas]]'' lives is the presence of fungi, because ''[[Collimonas]]'' have the ability of not only hydrolyzing the [[chitin]] produced by fungi for nutrients, but also producing materials (e.g., ''P. fluorescens'' 2-79) to protect themselves from fungal infection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mutual relationship is common in the oligotrophic environments. Additionally, ''[[Collimonas]]'' can also obtain electron sources from rocks and minerals by [[weathering]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leveau|first=Johan H. J.|last2=Uroz|first2=Stéphane|last3=De Boer|first3=Wietse|date=2010-02-01|title=The bacterial genus Collimonas: mycophagy, weathering and other adaptive solutions to life in oligotrophic soil environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02010.x/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=281–292|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02010.x|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In terms of polar areas, such as Antarctic and Arctic region, the soil environment is considered as oligotrophic because the soil is frozen with low biological activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most abundant species in the frozen soil are [[Actinobacteria]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Acidobacteria]] and [[Cyanobacteria]], together with a small amount of archaea and fungi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Actinobacteria]] can maintain the activity of their metabolic enzymes and continue their biochemical reactions under a wide range of low temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the DNA repairing machinery in [[Actinobacteria]] protects them from lethal DNA mutation at low temperature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makhalanyane|first=Thulani Peter|last2=Goethem|first2=Marc Warwick Van|last3=Cowan|first3=Don Arthur|title=Microbial diversity and functional capacity in polar soils|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166916300179|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=38|pages=159–166|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2016.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Cinema''''' (also called '''''On Cinema at the Cinema''''' for the video series) is an [[United States|American]] comedic film review [[podcast]] and [[web series]] starring [[Tim Heidecker]] and [[Gregg Turkington]]. The duo appear as a pair of hapless movie reviewers (using their own names). The show started as an independently released [[podcast]] from 2011 to 2013, before being picked up as a professionally produced web video series by [[Thing X]] in 2012–13 for its first two seasons, and then moving to [[Adult Swim.com]] in 2013. It has aired 10 seasons, plus one special
season titled "The Trial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/11/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-your-new-siskel-ebert/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Your New Siskel &amp; Ebert |publisher=[[Splitsider]] |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''On Cinema'' spawned a spinoff web series in its fifth season, ''[[Decker (series)|Decker]],'' a simultaneous spoof of political-thrillers and homebrew video intended for the web. It later became a [[TV series]], and as of 2018, it has aired 6 seasons of episodes total on Adultswim.com and [[Adult Swim]].

Heidecker and Turkington began making the podcast as a prank and a mockery of the "self-indulgence" of the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/01/25/faux-movie-review-web-series-cinema-cinema-develops-real-future/ |title=Faux movie-review web series 'On Cinema at the Cinema' develops a real future |publisher=Dailycal.org |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Heidecker and Turkington have created an immersive universe through ''On Cinema'' and ''Decker.'' A live [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] special is also done every year, streamed via [[YouTube]], with interactive elements for fans, such as polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2014/02/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-doing-a-live-oscars-special/ |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington Are Doing a Live Oscars Special |publisher=Splitsider |date=2014-02-25 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several seasons of ''On Cinema'' have discernible multi-episode plot arcs as Heidecker and Turkington explore the dynamic and characters they have created both in the series' episodes and, simultaneously, on social media, through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="mocktrial"&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker is putting himself on trial for murder right now as part of On Cinema's latest absurd twist"|url=https://www.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-is-putting-himself-on-trial-for-murder-ri-1820494473|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=15 November 2017|author=William Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who play along with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads". Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where they appear in character and interact with fans.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web|title="'Decker,' 'On Cinema' and the various, intertwined universes of comedian Tim Heidecker"|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-tim-heidecker-20170609-story.html|publisher=''[[The L.A.

For the Summer of 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe and special content.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-are-taking-on-cinema-1826240596 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington are taking On Cinema At The Cinema to cinemas |last=Barsanti |first=Sam |website=''[[The A.V.

==Premise==
Early audio episodes of ''On Cinema'' were quite short, frequently no more than one or two minutes long. Heidecker and Turkington would "review" films on these podcasts without actually providing any meaningful information or critical insight. Nearly every film that has been discussed or mentioned on ''On Cinema'' since the podcast's inception has received a "5 bags of popcorn" rating on a scale of five from the two reviewers, regardless of its reception elsewhere in the press or with the viewing public.

With the series' growth into an online video series, episodes grew to an average length of eight to twelve minutes. Although reviewing films remains a central conceit, the focus of the series quickly shifted from a mockery of amateur podcasting to an extended character study of the two podcasters. Heidecker, in character on ''On Cinema'', frequently uses his time on camera to discuss anything on his character's mind except film, especially his bizarre ailments, personal crises, and [[Conservatism in the United States|right-wing political views]], or to simply berate and belittle Turkington. Turkington's character fancies himself a "film expert," his primary qualification being an enormous collection of forgotten and arguably forgettable mainstream films from the 1980s and 1990s on [[VHS]]. The series continues to provide reviews that purposely offer no real critical insight. Recent seasons as of 2018 have seen Tim lose interest in reviewing and start a band first named ''Dekkar'' then ''DKR'' .

Guest appearances  have included [[Jordan Hoffman]], [[Jimmy McNichol]], [[Joe Estevez]], [[Lawrence Turman]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Mark Proksch]], [[John Aprea]], [[Peyton Reed]], and [[Nicholas Meyer]], some of whom also appear in the ''[[Decker (TV series)|Decker]]'' series.

==Series overview==
{{main|List of On Cinema episodes}}
{{see also|List of Decker episodes}}
{{:List of On Cinema episodes}}

===Podcast===
The ''On Cinema'' podcast was produced independently by Tim and Gregg. The podcast consists of Tim, along with Gregg as a "special guest" for every episode, covering movies poorly and with little insight, and often engaging in arguments. Gregg later developed a more pretentious "film buff" persona, and Tim took a turn to being obnoxiously political, sometimes devoting entire episodes to conspiracy theories, much to the chagrin of Gregg.

Another running joke that was carried over to the video series is Gregg's refusal to believe that ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is really "Star Trek II," instead often believing stubbornly that ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' is the real Star Trek II.

===Season 1===
Starting this season, the show is now in video format via [[Thing X]].com, as well as having its name changed to ''On Cinema at the Cinema''. The series is similar to the podcast, but this time episodes always take place on a set meant to look like a movie theatre. Gregg is still never acknowledged as more than a guest each episode, and starts his weekly segments "Popcorn Classics" and "On Cinema On Location" where he brings in obscure, forgotten VHS movies to showcase and travels to filming locations of obscure movies, respectively. Tim begins using "60 second soap box" to talk about current political issues with a conservative narrative, much to the continued annoyance of Gregg. With the start of the web series, Tim uses a rating scale of "bags of popcorn" ranging from 0–5, and while Gregg uses five as a max, Tim often goes overboard giving scores of "6 bags" or even more, creating tension and confusion throughout the season. Most of the films reviewed get a score of at least "5 bags" from both reviewers.

===Season 2===
Tim reveals he has [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] in his brain but does not want to get surgery because of "side effects, the whole medical industry, and [[Obamacare]]" while Gregg pushes for him to get surgery. In episode 208, Tim introduces the first special guest, Ayaka, a foreign exchange student from Japan staying with Tim's family.

The first Live On Cinema Oscar Special airs, where Tim and Gregg live stream during the [[Oscars]] and drink alcohol. Tim gets very drunk and throws up on some of Gregg's VHS tapes which causes Gregg to walk off the set.

===Season 3===
Season 3 moved the series from [[Thing X]] to [[Adultswim.com]]. The season begins with Tim in a head bandage and clearly in physical pain as he went through with surgery for his blood clots. As a result of him going through the surgery, Tim's wife divorces him and this is the last time his family is referred to throughout the series. Gregg begins his goal of making the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' by becoming the first person in history to watch 500 movies in 500 days. Tim kicks Gregg off the show after Gregg drives all the way from [[Hollywood]] to [[San Francisco]] to make a video alleging the location of a ''[[Star Trek]]'' filming location, after he and Tim had disagreed on it before. [[John Aprea]] and Ayaka are guests on the next episode, where Tim reveals he is dating Ayaka and says he loves her for the first time. In the season finale, Gregg returns to the show as Ayaka was deported back to Japan.

===Season 4===
Tim begins season four with many health problems and introduces his personal doctor, Dr. San (played by [[Zac Holtzman]]), an alternative medical doctor treating Tim with [[acupuncture]], [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] and other "natural" medicines. Dr. San begins coming onto the set with Tim, despite Gregg's objections. However, Tim's face becomes infected from the acupuncture and he denounces Dr. San.

Ayaka sends a letter to Tim on the show saying she is pregnant with Tim's child.

The second Live Oscar Special, Tim and Gregg drink (with Tim getting much drunker than Gregg). We are introduced to [[Mark Proksch]] who does impersonations of [[W.C. Fields]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].

===Season 5===
Tim moves to [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]] and buys a motorcycle to commute back and forth between there and Hollywood for the On Cinema taping.

Tim announces that Ayaka has had an [[abortion]], despite remaining [[pro-life]] on the topic, saying "when you are in that situation, choices have to be on the table." However, Gregg brings Ayaka onto On Cinema via [[Skype]] from Japan, revealing she did go through with the pregnancy and naming the boy Tom Cruise Heidecker Junior, after the actor [[Tom Cruise]]. Ayaka moves back to America with Tom Cruise Junior and into Gregg's apartment. This upsets Tim and he moves permanently to Jackson Hole. He makes Gregg host of the show and hands off all responsibilities to him in the season finale.

===Season 6===
Gregg begins his first season as host, but after he is unable to find a guest, he records himself having conversations with himself and plays VHS video of his conversation during the episode.

Tim returns as host in episode 602 after he realized his new friends in Jackson Hole were [[white supremacists]]. He rekindles his relationship with Ayaka and moves into Gregg's apartment with her and Tom Cruise Junior. In the season finale, Tim proposes to Ayaka and she accepts.

The third Live Oscar Special airs, while Tim and Gregg get drunk and Tim, once again, gets much drunker than Gregg and becomes belligerent. [[Peyton Reed]] comes on the Special to promote his new film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and announces that Gregg has been cast as a minor character in the movie, which upsets Tim. In the finale segment, Gregg introduces [[James Dean]], the former actor who was believed to be dead since 1955. After reading on a message board about how Dean faked his own death and wrote a memoir called "I'm Alive: How I Faked my own Death" he brings Dean on set as his return to the public. Tim does not believe this is the real James Dean, leading to him verbally and physically threatening Dean before trashing the set.

===Season 7===
Gregg moves to [[Victorville, California]] and opens the Victorville Film Archives in a storage locker, where he also lives.

Tim gives ''Ant-Man'' a rare one-bag of popcorn which upsets Gregg, leading to him accusing Tim of paying $15,000 to have a minor role in the new ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' movie, which Tim denies.

After meeting a man at [[Guitar Center]] named Axiom, Tim starts a rock band named "Dekkar" with him. Their debut single Empty Bottle is released on the show, which upsets Gregg as it is not movie related and was played instead of his Popcorn Classic segment.

Gregg tells Tim that Dr. San, who Tim has been looking for since he infected Tim's face with dirty needles in acupuncture in season four, is Ayaka's boss at her job. Tim walks off the set angry that he had not realized this. However, the next episode is "The Doctor San Forgiveness Special" where both Tim and Dr. San forgive each other. Dr. San takes over as Tom Cruise Junior's new [[Pediatrics|pediatric doctor]].

By the season seven finale, Tim announces that Tom Cruise Junior has died. He plays a musical tribute to his son with Axiom and Dr. San.

The fourth Live Oscar Special is the biggest one yet, with periodic musical performances by Dekkar (much to the annoyance of Gregg), the "Oscar Olympics" featuring three games, officiated by [[Joe Estevez]], and a DNA test by Dr. San of James Dean, which proves that he is in fact, James Dean. Tim hides the fact he has been drinking alcohol during the Special while no one else is, and he becomes angered by the DNA results. He proceeds to kick Dr. San off the set. An animated rendering of Tom Cruise Junior as a young adult comes on stage, in which Tim and the animated Tom Cruise Junior come out [[Anti-vaccination|against vaccination]].

===Season 8===
Season eight moves the show to Victorville, where Tim has now moved into the storage unit with Gregg. They both buy an abandoned [[movie theater]] and open it as the "Victorville Film Center" where instead of playing new releases, a nightly showing from Gregg's VHS collection of Popcorn Classics is played. Attendance is minimal because of the obscurity of the films. Mark Proksch is hired as a concessions cashier.

Dr. San prescribes Tim a "nutritional vape system" in which Tim replaces all meals and food with an [[electronic cigarette]] full of supposed nutrients. However, Tim's physical condition worsens as the season progresses, as he comes to the set sweating, bruised, hallucinating, and unfocused. Despite this, he continues to use his nutritional vape system. After he cannot take the physical pain and symptoms of the vape system, Tim goes to an actual doctor who informs him the vape and his blood is full of [[Lsd]], [[cocaine]], and multiple other drugs – both legal and illegal. Tim quits the vape system and swears off Dr. San once again. Tim announces that Ayaka is pregnant with their second child. After Tim tries to get Ayaka to get an abortion, she leaves him and moves back to Japan. Tim begins a romantic relationship with Axiom's sister, Juliana.

A fire is started in the storage unit after Tim's vape pen overheats one night, burning the entire facility down including the Victorville Film Archive. Tim suffers [[third degree burn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on all of his body, including his face and hands. After insurance will not cover the cost of the fire, he returns to the show in bandages so he can keep working to pay for the damages and lawsuits, which exceed $1,000,000 according to Gregg.

However, in Tim's return to On Cinema, he is surprised by an intervention by Gregg, Joe Estevez, John Aprea, Mark Proksch, Ayaka, Ayaka's father, and Axiom. They encourage Tim to live a healthier life, which upsets Tim. He yells and kicks everyone but Axiom out, and announces plans to start an [[electronic music]] version of Dekkar, now called "DKR".

The season finale ends with a remixed, electronic version of Empty Bottle and Tim announcing that Juliana is now pregnant with his child while Ayaka will go through with her pregnancy too.

===Season 9===
Season nine begins with Gregg informing the audience that the Victorville Film Center has burnt down while he speculates Tim may have done it to collect insurance money.

After Gregg and Tim move back to Hollywood, Tim opens up "Six Bag Cinemas", a new movie theater concept with recliner chairs and a waiter (who is Mark) that brings food to customers during the movie. Gregg constantly criticizes the theater and food.

After Tim stops using the facial cream for the burns on his face, his skin dies and he needs a [[skin transplant]]. After a selection process in which Tim volunteers most of the potential donors himself, Manuel from DKR is chosen and donates skin off of his lower back and buttocks to Tim.

Tim and Dr. San are arrested and jailed on [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]] charges. At Tim's "Electric Sun Desert Music Festival" in [[Apple Valley, California]], Dr. San allegedly gave out free samples of his nutritional vape system, the same one Tim uses, resulting in 20 deaths.  Gregg takes over as host with Mark as his co-host, and the two spend an entire episode blaming Tim instead of reviewing movies.

Tim returns on [[bail]], and finishes the last three episodes of the season with Turkington. Together with his lawyer, Doug Lyman, Tim has decided to pin the 20 deaths on Dr. San and the Apple Valley authorities who did not respond in time. In the season finale, it is revealed that Dr. San has committed suicide in jail, and that the relatives of the 20 who died are now primarily blaming Tim for the deaths. At the end of the final episode, Tim reveals to Gregg that he will never forget what Gregg said about him on the show, no matter what happens to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkington-s-movie-review-serie-1798257567 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington's movie review series returns next month |website=[[The A.V. Club]]}} by ''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trial===
A special event, titled "The Trial", began on November 15, 2017, streaming on Adult Swim's website with the trial of Tim Heidecker for the death of the "Electric Sun 20". Tim was found not guilty of the death of one of the 20, as that victim died of a heroin overdose. A [[mistrial]] was called for the remaining 19, due to a [[hung jury]] with 11 guilty and 1 not guilty verdicts. Gregg accused Tim of bribing the juror who voted not guilty.

Director and writer [[Nicholas Meyer]] appears as one of the testifiers in an ongoing joke alluding to a long-standing disagreement between Tim and Gregg as to whether or not San Francisco is the setting for the film "Star Trek II." &lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;

===Season X ===
During the Fifth Oscar Special, Mark got locked tight into a [[standard diving dress]] while doing an impression of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] character in the [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] movie and had to be hospitalized for [[asphyxiation]].

Tim returns from the trial free from prison but facing a [[civil suit]] from one of the families of the Electric Sun 19. His assets, including On Cinema and Decker, are being seized and he claims he might soon be facing bankruptcy. After threatening to commit suicide and with help from his attorney (Mark Dwyer), Tim manages to convince the Delgado family to let him try to earn money for them with his various assets. The Delgado's and Tim's Attorney like the show after Episode 7, and hire Gregg as the managing editor of the newly incorporated Delgado Media Holding company, effectively giving him creative control on On Cinema.

The intro and production set have been upgraded, and the show now has a sponsor by name of Rio Jenesis,&lt;ref name="riojenesis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riojenesis.com/ |title=Rio Jenesis |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a protein shake company that creates a "germ shield", of which Tim is now consuming. Gregg begins writing letters to [[Tim Burton]], questioning why he didn't work with [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]''. He also announces that he has resurrected his film archives, which appears to be several bins full of VHS tapes (later revealed to be stocked in Mark Proksch hospital room) and is now collecting and wearing movie promotional hats to Tim's vocal displeasure. Episodes 4 through 6 were filmed in [[360-degree video]].

As of Episode 7, the show has returned to form with a stronger focus on movies than it had previously had in the last several seasons. However, this is in the context of Tim needing to turn the show around, with him openly discussing the possibility of suicide if it doesn't become more successful. The next three episodes, 8–10, saw Gregg's role on the show increasingly become that of the host, while Tim's role was diminished, allowing for more of Gregg's segments, including Popcorn Classics, to become larger segments in each episode. These changes coincided with Gregg's new role as the managing editor in On Cinema's parent company.  In episode 10, the season finale, Tim threw a fit of rage and insulted the Delgados while announcing his wish to campaign for the post of [[district attorney]] of the [[San Bernardino County]].

==Production==
Heidecker has stated that On Cinema was started out of a desire to mock the podcasting community.&lt;ref name="dailycal1"/&gt; The first episode was recorded on set of ''[[The Comedy]]'', where Heidecker and Turkington were working together, after Heidecker proposed the idea between takes.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;
In April 2017, On Cinema initiated a [[Patreon]] page for funding, most of it going to the Oscar specials, with some of the higher options including receiving producer credits, walk-on roles for the Oscar specials, or live custom [[Skype]] reviews from [[Gregg Turkington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.patreon.com/oncinema On Cinema Patreon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The show has a dedicated [[cult following]] of fans who interact with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as "GreggHeads" or "TimHeads" in the frequent personal conflicts between the hosts which are often only tangentially, if at all, related to films or cinema.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; During the annual live Oscar special, Tim and Gregg both frequently provide interactive elements via online polls for fans to vote on. This cult following is especially found on [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], the latter through Gregg and Tim's respective profiles, of which Gregg has completely devoted to the persona of his alter-ego. Heidecker and Turkington have also appeared in character on the podcasts ''Kreative Kontrol'' and ''[[Best Show]]'' in 2015 and 2017.

Heidecker and Turkington also started ''Decker-Con'', where new episodes of ''Decker'' are shown to fans and the cast appears as their "On Cinema" characters to field questions.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;

In 2013 the ''On Cinema Film Guide'' app was released, featuring the voices of Turkington and Heidecker reviewing over 17,000 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild |first=Matt |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/tim-heidecker-and-gregg-turkingtons-emon-cinemaem--97166 |title=Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington’s On Cinema is now a very meta app|publisher=Avclub.com |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For "The Trial", Heidecker and Turkington upended the traditional review aspect of the series, and staged an elaborate mock event where Tim's character was "on trial for murder" that lasted over a week. It received acclaim from observers, some of whom called it "brilliant" and "ambitious."&lt;ref name="mocktrial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Tim Heidecker Is On Trial For Murder in Adult Swim's Latest Web Stunt"|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/tim-heidecker-is-on-trial-for-murder-in-adult-swim.html|publisher=''[[Paste Magazine]]''|date=8 November 2017|author=Jim Vorel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denofgeekoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim’s On Cinema Has Become A Murder Trial|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/on-cinema/269227/adult-swim-s-on-cinema-has-become-a-murder-trial|publisher=''[[Den of Geek]]''|date=25 November 2017|author=Daniel Kurland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Swim Is Broadcasting a Multi-Day Fake Murder Trial for Tim Heidecker|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/11/on-cinema-tim-heidecker-murder-trial|publisher=[[Spin Magazine]]|date= November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Touring ==
In 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide ''On Cinema Live!'' tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe such as [[Joe Estevez]], the band ''Dekkar'' and special content created only for the tour, such as a live reviewing of all mid-2018 major release films: [[Superfly (2018 film)|''Superfly'']], ''[[Mission Impossible: Fallout]]'', ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'', ''[[Sicario 2: Soldado]]'', ''[[Ant Man &amp; The Wasp]]''.&lt;ref name="Barsanti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naftule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portlandmercury.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consequenceofsound.net"/&gt;

The '''paradise garden''' is a form of [[garden]] of [[History of Iran|Old Iranian]] origin, specifically [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]. Originally denominated by a single noun denoting "a walled-in compound or [[garden]]", from "''pairi''" ("around") and "''daeza''" or "''diz''" ("wall", "brick", or "shape"), [[Xenophon]] Grecized the Persian phrase "''pairi-daeza''" into "''paradeisos''".&lt;ref name=hobhouse&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardens of Persia|author1=Penelope Hobhouse |author2=Erica Hunningher |author3=Jerry Harpur |publisher=Kales Press|year=2004|pages=7–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMFRyiAxZ6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Persian+garden&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20garden&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the [[hortus conclusus|enclosed garden]] is often referred to as the paradise garden because of additional [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] connotations of "paradise".{{which?|date=December 2018}}

==Qualities==
The essential qualities of the paradise garden derive from its original, arid or semi-arid homeland. The fundamental quality is enclosure of the cultivated area, which excludes the wildness of nature and includes cultivated and irrigated greenery, providing privacy and security. The most common design of the perimeter walls is that of a rectangle, and this forms one of its primary qualities.

Another common quality is the elaborate use of water, often in [[canal]]s, [[pond]]s, or [[rill]]s, sometimes in [[fountain]]s, and less often in [[waterfall]]s. The rectangular or rectilinear design is often extended to the water features, which typically quarter the garden. This design derives from or is echoed in that of the [[Garden of Eden]], which in ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' is described as having a central spring that feeds four rivers, which each flow out into the world beyond.

Much of the use and symbolism of the paradise garden is derived from the [[Garden of Eden]]. It was designed to symbolize [[Immortality|eternal life]]. A tree with a spring issuing from its roots especially symbolises this. Additionally, the contrast of a formal garden design with the informality of freely growing plants is a recurring theme in many paradise gardens. Odor and fruit are important elements of this garden.

==Derived garden types==
The paradise garden is one of the few original and fundamental kinds of garden from which all gardens in history derive, sometimes in combinations. In its simplest form, the paradise garden consists of a formal, rectangular pool, having a flow just sufficient to give it movement, and with a dais from which to observe it. However, a pavilion provides more permanent shelter than the original tent. Strictly aligned, formally arranged trees, especially the ''chenar'' or ''[[Platanus]]'', provide shade.

The [[Achaemenid]] kings built paradise gardens within enclosed royal hunting parks, these being a different tradition of landscape gardening, which they inherited from the [[Assyria]]ns, for whom the ritual lion hunt was a rite that authenticated kingship, being far more than a mere sport.

Many of the [[Islamic garden|Islamic horticultural traditions]] and later [[Europe]]an traditions derive from that of the paradise garden. Examples of the paradise garden and its derivations are present in many of the [[History of gardening|historic gardens]] of [[Islam]]ic and [[Europe]]an nations. In the east, by way of the [[Persian garden]] it gave rise to the [[Mughal gardens]] of [[India]], a late example of which is the garden of the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]]. In the farthest west, it informed the paved and tiled courtyards, arcades, and pools and fountains of Moorish [[Andalusia]]. The fundamental design of the [[Gardens of Versailles]] in [[France]] almost replicates the paradise gardens of [[Pasargad]], and the gardens of the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] appear inspired by them. Another example is the [[Terraces (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í Terraces]] and [[Mansion of Bahjí]] on [[Mount Carmel]] in [[Israel]], both of which have extensive gardens of intricate design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/design-management/ Yael Hammerman: Distinctive Design of the Bahá’í Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anatomically, the petrolingual ligament demarcates two of the segments of the internal carotid artery: 
* The petrolingual ligament marks the end of the [[petrous portion of the internal carotid artery|petrous]] section of the [[internal carotid artery]]. 
* The [[cavernous]] section of the internal carotid artery begins at the superior aspect of the petrolingual ligament.

For [[surgeons]] and [[radiologists]], it is important to be oriented to the location of this ligament in cases of possible [[dissection]] of the internal carotid artery, as it helps determine whether the dissection has occurred inside or outside the cavernous sinus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007010050086|title=The Petrolingual Ligament: The Anatomy and Surgical Exposure of the Posterolateral Landmark of The Cavernous Sinus|first1=I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Reverberation mapping''' is an [[astrophysics|astrophysical technique]] for measuring the structure of the [[broad emission-line region]] (BLR) around a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of an [[active galaxy]], and thus estimating the hole's mass. It is considered a "primary" mass estimation technique, i.e., the mass is measured directly from the motion that its [[gravitational force]] induces in the nearby gas.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David| authorlink=David Merritt | title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravity]] defines a direct relation between the mass of a central object and the speed of a smaller object in orbit around the central mass. Thus, for matter orbiting a black hole, the black hole mass is related by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; 
GM_\bullet = f R_\mathrm{BLR} (\Delta V)^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

to the [[RMS velocity]] Δ''V'' of gas moving near the black hole in the broad emission-line region, measured from the [[Doppler effect|Doppler broadening]] of the gaseous emission lines. In that formula, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;BLR&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius of the broad-line region; ''G'' is the [[constant of gravitation]]; and ''f'' is a poorly known "form factor" that depends on the shape of the BLR.

While Δ''V'' can be measured directly using [[spectroscopy]], the necessary determination of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;BLR&lt;/sub&gt; is much less straightforward. This is where reverberation mapping comes into play.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Peterson &amp; K. Horne  [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407538 Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes the fact that the emission-line fluxes vary strongly in response to changes in the continuum, i.e., the light from the [[accretion disk]] near the black hole. Put simply, if the brightness of the accretion disk varies, the emission lines, which are excited in response to the accretion disk's light, will "reverberate", that is, vary in response. But it will take some time for light from the accretion disk to reach the broad-line region. Thus, the emission-line response is delayed with respect to changes in the continuum. Assuming that this delay is solely due to light travel times, the distance traveled by the light, corresponding to the radius of the broad emission-line region, can be measured.

Only a small handful of AGN (less than 40) have been accurately "mapped" in this way. An alternative approach is to use an empirical [[correlation]] between ''R''&lt;sub&gt;BLR&lt;/sub&gt; and the continuum luminosity.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt;

Another uncertainty is the value of ''f''. In principle, the response of the BLR to variations in the continuum could be used to map out the three-dimensional structure of the BLR. In practice, the amount and quality of data required to carry out such a [[deconvolution]] is prohibitive. Until about 2004, ''f'' was estimated ab initio based on simple models for the structure of the BLR. More recently, the value of ''f'' has been determined so as to bring the [[M-sigma relation]] for active galaxies into the best possible agreement with the [[M–sigma relation]] for quiescent galaxies.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt; When ''f'' is determined in this way, reverberation mapping becomes a "secondary", rather than "primary," mass estimation technique.

The '''Science Media Centre of Canada''' (SMCC) was formally opened on September 27, 2010. It is located in [[Ottawa]].

The purpose of the centre is to serve [[journalist]]s with accurate information on [[science|scientific]] matters. The centre has a ''Research Advisory Panel'' of 20 [[Canadians|Canadian]] scientists who will make their expertise available in a simple and understandable manner. In order to secure objectivity, the centre has an ''Editorial Advisory Committee'' of eight journalists.
The centre is bilingual.

== Goal ==
The ultimate goal of SMCC is an "increased public engagement with science issues through media coverage of science that is more informed, more accurate and more incisive."

== Other SMCs ==
Science Media Centres exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre|UK]], [[Australian Science Media Centre|Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]]. The Science Media Centre of Canada is independent with respect to the other centres.

{{Computer hacking}}
A '''security hacker''' is someone who seeks to breach defenses and [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] weaknesses in a [[Computer|computer system]] or [[computer network|network]]. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Ira. ''Spies Among Us: How to Stop the Spies, Terrorists, Hackers, and Criminals You Don't Even Know You Encounter Every Day.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2005. pg. 92. {{ISBN|9780764589904}}.&lt;/ref&gt; challenge, recreation,&lt;ref name="crackdown" /&gt; or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blomquist|first=Brian|date=May 29, 1999|url=http://archive.nypost.com/a/475198|title=FBI's Web Site Socked as Hackers Target Feds|newspaper=New York Post}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- historical precedent, takes precedence --&gt;

There is a longstanding [[Hacker|controversy]] about the term's true meaning. In this controversy, the term ''hacker'' is reclaimed by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|computer programmers]] who argue that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.5.0.dos.txt|title= The Hacker's Dictionary|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and that '''''cracker''''' is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether computer criminal ([[#Black hat|black hats]]) or computer security expert ([[White hat (computer security)|white hats]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://stallman.org/archives/2012-sep-dec.html#06_December_2012_%28Ecuadorian_white_hat_cracker_freed%29 Political notes from 2012: September–December]. stallman.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html |title=Jargon File: Cracker |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |quote=Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article concluded that "... the black-hat meaning still prevails among the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yagoda |first1=Ben |title=A Short History of "Hack"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack |work=The New Yorker |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{tone inline|date=August 2016}}

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of computer security hacker history}}
[[File:Stering.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce Sterling]], author of ''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'']]
In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. While including those who endeavor to strengthen such mechanisms, it is more often used by the [[mass media]] and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measures. That is, the media portrays the 'hacker' as a villain. Nevertheless, parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense. White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers, who utilize hacking in a helpful way. White hats are becoming a necessary part of the information security field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Tracey|title=Ethical hackers: putting on the white hat|journal=Network Security|date=22 July 2011|volume=2011|issue=7|pages=10–13|doi=10.1016/s1353-4858(11)70075-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They operate under a code, which acknowledges that breaking into other people's computers is bad, but that discovering and exploiting security mechanisms and breaking into computers is still an interesting activity that can be done ethically and legally. Accordingly, the term bears strong connotations that are favorable or pejorative, depending on the context.

The subculture around such hackers is termed network hacker subculture, hacker scene, or computer underground. It initially developed in the context of [[phreaking]] during the 1960s and the microcomputer [[Bulletin board system|BBS scene]] of the 1980s. It is implicated with ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' and the ''[[alt.2600]]'' newsgroup.

In 1980, an article in the August issue of ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (with commentary by [[Philip Zimbardo]]) used the term "hacker" in its title: "The Hacker Papers". It was an excerpt from a Stanford Bulletin Board discussion on the addictive nature of computer use. In the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]'', Kevin Flynn ([[Jeff Bridges]]) describes his intentions to break into ENCOM's computer system, saying "I've been doing a little hacking here". CLU is the [[software]] he uses for this. By 1983, hacking in the sense of breaking computer security had already been in use as computer jargon,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg1-81-MM-DD.txt 1981 version of the ''Jargon File''], entry "hacker", last meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no public awareness about such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer hacking: Where did it begin and how did it grow?|publisher=WindowSecurity.com|date=October 16, 2002|url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/whitepapers/Computer_hacking_Where_did_it_begin_and_how_did_it_grow_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the release of the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that year, featuring a computer intrusion into [[NORAD]], raised the public belief that computer security hackers (especially teenagers) could be a threat to national security. This concern became real when, in the same year, a gang of teenage hackers in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], known as [[The 414s]], broke into computer systems throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], including those of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Security Pacific Bank]].&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|title=The 414 Gang Strikes Again|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|page=75|date=August 29, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797,00.html|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly grew media attention,&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=September 27, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17-year-old Neal Patrick emerged as the spokesman for the gang, including a cover story in ''[[Newsweek]]'' entitled "Beware: Hackers at play", with Patrick's photograph on the cover.&lt;ref name = "iophas"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beware: Hackers at play|newspaper=Newsweek|pages=42–46, 48|date=September 5, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article appears to be the first use of the word ''hacker'' by the mainstream media in the pejorative sense.

Pressured by media coverage, congressman [[Dan Glickman]] called for an investigation and began work on new laws against computer hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50606-2002Jun26.html|accessdate=2006-04-14|title=Timeline: The U.S. Government and Cybersecurity | date=2003-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"&gt;David Bailey, "Attacks on Computers: Congressional Hearings and Pending Legislation," sp, p. 180, 1984 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neal Patrick testified before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on September 26, 1983, about the dangers of computer hacking, and six bills concerning computer crime were introduced in the House that year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"/&gt; As a result of these laws against computer criminality, white hat, [[grey hat]] and black hat hackers try to distinguish themselves from each other, depending on the legality of their activities. These moral conflicts are expressed in [[Loyd Blankenship|The Mentor]]'s "[[The Hacker Manifesto]]", published 1986 in ''[[Phrack]]''.

Use of the term hacker meaning computer criminal was also advanced by the title "Stalking the Wily Hacker", an article by [[Clifford Stoll]] in the May 1988 issue of the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''. Later that year, the release by [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] of the so-called [[Morris worm]] provoked the popular media to spread this usage. The popularity of Stoll's book ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]'', published one year later, further entrenched the term in the public's consciousness.

==Classifications==
Several subgroups of the computer underground with different attitudes use different terms to demarcate themselves from each other, or try to exclude some specific group with whom they do not agree.

[[Eric S. Raymond]], author of ''[[Jargon File|The New Hacker's Dictionary]]'', advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers. Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as a wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]], [[#Black hat|black hat]] and [[script kiddie]]. In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term ''cracker'' for more malicious activity.

According to Ralph D. Clifford, a ''cracker'' or ''cracking'' is to "gain unauthorized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information contained in that system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These subgroups may also be defined by the legal status of their activities.&lt;ref name="hacker hats" /&gt;

===White hat===
{{Main article|White_hat_(computer_security)|l1=White hat}}
A [[white hat (computer security)|white hat hacker]] breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either to test their own security system, perform [[penetration test]]s, or [[vulnerability assessment]]s for a client - or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term is generally synonymous with [[Hacker ethic|ethical hacker]], and the EC-Council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccouncil.org/ EC-Council]. eccouncil.org&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.&lt;ref name="hacker hats"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Douglas |title=Professional Penetration Testing |year=2010 |publisher=Syngress Press |isbn=978-1-59749-425-0 |page=503 |chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black hat===
{{Main article|Black hat}}
A "black hat" hacker is a hacker who "violates computer security for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain" (Moore, 2005).&lt;ref name="Moore2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=Cybercrime: Investigating High Technology Computer Crime|year=2005|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Company|isbn=1-59345-303-5|page=258}}Robert Moore&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Richard Stallman]], to contrast the maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness and exploration in [[hacker culture]], or the ethos of the [[white hat hacker]] who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as a means of legitimate employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien, Marakas|first=James, George|title=Management Information Systems |year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill/ Irwin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-752217-9|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black hat hackers form the stereotypical, illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal".&lt;ref name="moore2006"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grey hat===
{{Main article|Grey hat}}
A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker. A grey hat hacker may surf the Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect, for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee.&lt;ref name="moore2006" /&gt; Grey hat hackers sometimes find the defect of a system and publish the facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain, unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical.

===Elite hacker===
A [[achieved status|social status]] among hackers, ''elite'' is used to describe the most skilled.&lt;!--p. 117--&gt; Newly discovered [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] circulate among these hackers.&lt;!--p. 86 --&gt; Elite [[hacker group|groups]] such as [[Masters of Deception]] conferred a kind of credibility on their members.&lt;!-- p. 90 --&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas2002"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Script kiddie===
A [[script kiddie]] (also known as a ''skid'' or ''skiddie'') is an unskilled hacker who breaks into computer systems by using automated tools written by others (usually by other black hat hackers), hence the term script (i.e. a prearranged plan or set of activities) kiddie (i.e. kid, child—an individual lacking knowledge and experience, immature),&lt;ref name="Andress 10"&gt;{{cite book |title=CIW Security Professional |last=Andress |first=Mandy |author2=Cox, Phil |author3=Tittel, Ed  |year=2001 |publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-7645-4822-0 |page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with little understanding of the underlying concept.

===Neophyte===
A neophyte ("[[newbie]]", or "noob") is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking.&lt;ref name="moore2006"/&gt;

===Blue hat===
A [[BlueHat|blue hat]] hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who is used to bug-test a system prior to its launch, looking for exploits so they can be closed. [[Microsoft]] also uses the term ''BlueHat'' to represent a series of security briefing events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue hat hacker Definition|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=blue+hat+hacker&amp;i=56321,00.asp|work=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|accessdate=May 31, 2010|quote=A security professional invited by Microsoft to find vulnerabilities in Windows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried|first=Ina|authorlink=Ina Fried|title=Blue Hat summit meant to reveal ways of the other side|url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-meets-the-hackers/2009-1002_3-5747813.html|work=Microsoft meets the hackers|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=May 31, 2010|date=June 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=At Microsoft, Interlopers Sound Off on Security|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/17/technology/17hackers.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1|accessdate=May 31, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 17, 2005|authorlink=John Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacktivist===
A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to publicize a social, ideological, religious or political message.

[[Hacktivism]] can be divided into two main groups:
* [[Cyberterrorism]]&amp;nbsp;— Activities involving [[website defacement]] or [[denial-of-service attack]]s; and,

==Attacks==
{{Main article|Computer security}}
{{Computer security}}

A typical approach in an attack on Internet-connected system is:
# [[Network enumeration]]: Discovering information about the intended target.
# [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability analysis]]: Identifying potential ways of attack.
# [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploitation]]: Attempting to compromise the system by employing the vulnerabilities found through the vulnerability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Ajay; Klavinsky, Thomas and Laliberte, Scott
(March 15, 2002) [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25916 Security Through Penetration Testing: Internet Penetration]. informit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to do so, there are several recurring tools of the trade and techniques used by computer criminals and security experts.

===Security exploits===
{{Main article|Exploit (computer security)}}

A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/publication/the_growing_hacking_threat_to_websites.pdf |title=The Growing Hacking Threat to Websites: An Ongoing Commitment to Web Application Security |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Chris |last2=Martinez |first2=Richard |publisher=Frost &amp; Sullivan |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of security exploits are [[SQL injection]], [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice. Other exploits would be able to be used through [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[PHP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and some Web pages. These are very common in Web site and Web domain hacking.

===Techniques===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
;Vulnerability scanner
:A [[vulnerability scanner]] is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses. Hackers also commonly use [[port scanner]]s. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are "open" or available to access the computer, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port, and its version number. ([[Firewall (computing)|Firewalls]] defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports and machines, but they can still be circumvented.)

;Finding vulnerabilities
:Hackers may also attempt to find vulnerabilities manually. A common approach is to search for possible vulnerabilities in the code of the computer system then test them, sometimes [[reverse engineering]] the software if the code is not provided.

;Brute-force attack
:Password guessing. This method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used, because of the time a brute-force search takes.&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Sean Michael. "Sentry MBA Uses Credential Stuffing To Hack Sites." ''Eweek'' (2016): 8. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Password cracking
:[[Password cracking]] is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Common approaches include repeatedly trying guesses for the password, trying the most common passwords by hand, and repeatedly trying passwords from a "dictionary", or a text file with many passwords.

;Packet analyzer
:A [[packet analyzer]] ("packet sniffer") is an application that captures data packets, which can be used to capture passwords and other [[data in transit]] over the network.

;Spoofing attack (phishing)
:A [[spoofing attack]] involves one program, system or website that successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and is thereby treated as a trusted system by a user or another program&amp;nbsp;— usually to fool programs, systems or users into revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords.

;Rootkit
:A [[rootkit]] is a program that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, making it virtually impossible for them to be detected by checking [[Process (computing)|process tables]].

;Social engineering
:In the second stage of the targeting process, hackers often use [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tactics to get enough information to access the network. They may contact the system administrator and pose as a user who cannot get access to his or her system. This technique is portrayed in the 1995 film ''Hackers'', when protagonist Dade "Zero Cool" Murphy calls a somewhat clueless employee in charge of security at a television network. Posing as an accountant working for the same company, Dade tricks the employee into giving him the phone number of a modem so he can gain access to the company's computer system.

:Hackers who use this technique must have cool personalities, and be familiar with their target's security practices, in order to trick the system administrator into giving them information. In some cases, a help-desk employee with limited security experience will answer the phone and be relatively easy to trick. Another approach is for the hacker to pose as an angry supervisor, and when his/her authority is questioned, threaten to fire the help-desk worker. Social engineering is very effective, because users are the most vulnerable part of an organization. No security devices or programs can keep an organization safe if an employee reveals a password to an unauthorized person.

:Social engineering can be broken down into four sub-groups:
:* '''''Intimidation''''' As in the "angry supervisor" technique above, the hacker convinces the person who answers the phone that their job is in danger unless they help them. At this point, many people accept that the hacker is a supervisor and give them the information they seek.
:* '''''Helpfulness'''''  The opposite of intimidation, helpfulness exploits many people's natural instinct to help others solve problems. Rather than acting angry, the hacker acts distressed and concerned. The help desk is the most vulnerable to this type of social engineering, as (a.) its general purpose is to help people; and (b.) it usually has the authority to change or reset passwords, which is exactly what the hacker wants.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Samuel T. C. "Helping The Hacker? Library Information, Security, And Social Engineering." ''Information Technology &amp; Libraries'' 25.4 (2006): 222-225. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''''Name-dropping''''' The hacker uses names of authorized users to convince the person who answers the phone that the hacker is a legitimate user him or herself. Some of these names, such as those of webpage owners or company officers, can easily be obtained online. Hackers have also been known to obtain names by examining discarded documents ([[garbage picking|"dumpster diving"]]).
:* '''''Technical'''''  Using technology is also a way to get information. A hacker can send a fax or email to a legitimate user, seeking a response that contains vital information. The hacker may claim that he or she is involved in law enforcement and needs certain data for an investigation, or for record-keeping purposes.

;Trojan horses
:A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] is a program that seems to be doing one thing but is actually doing another. It can be used to set up a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] in a computer system, enabling the intruder to gain access later. (The name refers to the [[Trojan Horse|horse]] from the [[Trojan War]], with the conceptually similar function of deceiving defenders into bringing an intruder into a protected area.)

;Computer virus
:A [[computer virus|virus]] is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. By doing this, it behaves similarly to a [[Virus|biological virus]], which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes, most are considered malicious.

;Computer worm
:Like a virus, a [[computer worm|worm]] is also a self-replicating program. It differs from a virus in that (a.) it propagates through computer networks without user intervention; and (b.) does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Nonetheless, many people use the terms "virus" and "worm" interchangeably to describe any self-propagating program.

;Keystroke logging
:A [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] is a tool designed to record ("log") every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval, usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine. Some keyloggers use virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to conceal themselves. However, some of them are used for legitimate purposes, even to enhance computer security. For example, a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a [[point of sale]] to detect evidence of employee fraud.

;Attack patterns
:[[Attack patterns]] are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system. They can be used for testing purposes or locating potential vulnerabilities. They also provide, either physically or in reference, a common solution pattern for preventing a given attack.

'''Tools and Procedures'''
:A thorough examination of hacker tools and procedures may be found in Cengage Learning's E|CSA certification workbook.&lt;ref name="E|CSA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Penetration Testing: Procedures &amp; Methodologies |last=Press |first=EC-Council |year=2011 |publisher=CENGAGE Learning|location=Clifton, NY |isbn=1435483677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its members often advocate freedom of information, strongly opposing the principles of copyright, as well as the rights of free speech and privacy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Writing software and performing other activities to support these views is referred to as [[hacktivism]]. Some consider illegal cracking ethically justified for these goals; a common form is [[website defacement]]. The computer underground is frequently compared to the Wild West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jordan, Tim  |author2=Taylor, Paul A. | pages = 133–134  | title = Hacktivism and Cyberwars  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 2004  | isbn = 978-0-415-26003-9  | quote = Wild West imagery has permeated discussions of cybercultures.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for hackers to use aliases to conceal their identities.

===Hacker groups and conventions===
{{Main article|Hacker conference|Hacker group}}

The computer underground is supported by regular real-world gatherings called [[hacker convention]]s or "hacker cons". These events include [[SummerCon]] (Summer), [[DEF CON]], [[HoHoCon]] (Christmas), [[ShmooCon]] (February), [[Black Hat Conference|BlackHat]], [[Chaos Communication Congress]], AthCon, Hacker Halted, and HOPE.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Local Hackfest groups organize and compete to develop their skills to send a team to a prominent convention to compete in group pentesting, exploit and forensics on a larger scale. Hacker groups became popular in the early 1980s, providing access to hacking information and resources and a place to learn from other members. Computer [[bulletin board systems]] (BBSs), such as the Utopias, provided platforms for information-sharing via dial-up modem. Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with elite groups.&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt;

===United States===

{{usc|18|1030}}, more commonly known as the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], prohibits unauthorized access or damage of "protected computers". "Protected computers" are defined in {{USCSub|18|1030|e|2}} as:

* A computer exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government.
* A computer which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States;

The maximum imprisonment or fine for violations of the ''Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' depends on the severity of the violation and the offender's history of violations under the ''Act''.

==Hacking and the media==

===Hacker magazines===
{{Main category|Hacker magazines}}
The most notable hacker-oriented print publications are ''[[Phrack]]'', ''[[Hakin9]]'' and ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]''. While the information contained in hacker magazines and [[ezine]]s was often outdated by the time they were published, they enhanced their contributors' reputations by documenting their successes.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Douglas |title=Hacker Culture |year=2003 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-3346-3 |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sex and the law}}

'''Sex and the law''' deals with the regulation by law of [[human sexual activity]]. Sex laws vary from one place or [[jurisdiction]] to another, and have varied over time, and unlawful sexual acts are also called '''sex crimes'''.

Some laws regulating sexual activity are intended to protect one or all participants, while others are intended to proscribe behavior that has been defined as a crime. For example, a law may proscribe [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]] if one person knows that he or she has a [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual disease]] or to protect a minor; or it may proscribe non-consensual sex, or because of a relationship between the participants, etc. In general, laws may proscribe acts which are considered either [[sexual abuse]] or behavior that societies consider to be inappropriate and against the [[social norm]]s. Sexual abuse is unwanted sexual contact between two or more adults or two or more [[Minor (law)|minors]], and, depending on laws with regard to [[age of consent]], sexual contact between an adult and a minor.

==Definitions==
Sex crimes are forms of human sexual behavior that are [[crime]]s. Someone who commits one is said to be a ''[[sex offender]]''. Some sex crimes are crimes of [[violence]] that involve sex. Others are violations of social [[taboo]]s, such as [[incest]], [[sodomy]], [[indecent exposure]] or [[exhibitionism]]. There is much variation among cultures as to what is considered a crime or not, and in what ways or to what extent crimes are punished.

Western cultures are often far more tolerant of acts, such as [[oral sex]], that have traditionally been held to be crimes in some cultures, but combine this with lesser tolerance for the remaining crimes. By contrast, many cultures with a strong religious tradition consider a far broader range of activities to be serious crimes.

As a general rule, the law in many countries often intervenes in sexual activity involving young or adolescent children below the legal age of consent, non-consensual deliberate displays or illicit watching of sexual activity, sex with close [[Kinship|relative]]s (incest), harm to animals, acts involving the deceased ([[necrophilia]]), and also when there is harassment, nuisance, fear, injury, or assault of a sexual nature, or serious risk of abuse of certain professional relationships. Separately, the law usually regulates or controls the [[censorship]] of [[pornography|pornographic]] or [[obscenity|obscene]] material as well. A rape charge can only be issued when a person(s) of any age does not provide consent for sexual activity.

==Possible enforcement==
The activities listed below carry a condition of illegality in some jurisdictions if acted upon, though they may be legally [[sexual roleplay|role-played]] between [[informed consent|consenting]] partners of legal age:
{{colbegin}}
*[[Rape]], [[lust murder]] and other forms of [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual abuse]]
*[[Child sexual abuse]]
*[[Statutory rape]]
*[[Spousal rape]]
*[[Obscenity]]
*[[Human trafficking]]
*[[Frotteurism]], sexual arousal through rubbing one's self against a non-consenting stranger in public
*[[Exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]], if deliberate and non-consensual, called "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" respectively in this context.
*[[Incest]] between close relatives
*[[Telephone scatologia]], making obscene telephone calls for the purpose of sexual arousal
*[[Zoosexuality and the law|Sex with animals]]
*[[Necrophilia]]
*[[Sexual harassment]]
*Sexual acts by people in a [[position of trust]] (such as teachers, doctors and police officers), towards people under 18 which they are involved with professionally.
*[[Public order crime]]s are crimes that interrupt the flow of daily life and business according to local community standards. Public order crimes include [[paraphilia]] (deviancies).
*Various paraphilias and [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]] such as [[transvestic fetishism|transvestitism]]
*[[Prostitution]] and/or [[pimp]]ing
*Ownership of [[vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] and other [[sex toy]]s
*[[Public urination]]
*[[Streaking]]
*[[Sodomy law|Sodomy]]
*[[Theft|Stealing]] underwear, sometimes regarded as more serious when done in a sexual context.
{{colend}}

A variety of laws aim to protect children by making various acts with children a sex crime. For example, the "corruption of minors" by introducing material or behaviors that are intended to [[Child grooming|groom a minor]] for future sexual conduct.  The materials or behavior can involve sexual content but does not necessarily have to.  Depending on the jurisdiction, this conduct can be charged as a felony or a misdemeanor.  Sometimes these laws overlap with age of consent laws, laws preventing the exposure of children to pornography, laws making it a crime for a child to be involved in (or exposed to) certain sexual behaviors, and the production and ownership of [[child pornography]] (sometimes including simulated images). In some countries such as the UK, the age for child pornography is higher than the age of consent, hence child pornography laws also cover images involving consenting adults.

[[Sadomasochistic]] conduct among adults can fall into a legal grey area. Some jurisdictions criminalize some or all sadomasochistic acts, regardless of [[Consent (criminal law)|legal consent]] and impose liability for any injuries caused. ''(See [[Consent (BDSM)]])''  Other jurisdictions permit sadomasochistic conduct so long as the participants consent to the conduct.

==Age of consent==
{{main|Age of consent|Statutory rape}}
While the phrases "age of consent" or "statutory rape" typically do not appear in legal [[statute]]s,&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waites| first = Matthew|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn= 978-1-4039-2173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; when used in relation to sexual activity, the age of consent is the minimum age at which a person is considered to be legally competent of consenting to engage in sexual acts. This should not be confused with the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], or the [[marriageable age]].

The age of consent varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="waites"/&gt; The median seems to range from 16 to 18 years, but laws stating ages ranging from 9 to 21 do exist. In some jurisdictions, the age of consent takes account of a mental or functional age,&lt;ref name="hhriqf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605002946/http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html|archivedate=2013-06-05|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-06-30|df=}} [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/..%5Csyllabi99%5CApril%5C126545_syl.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} {{cite web|url=http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605002946/http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html|archivedate=2013-06-05|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-06-30|df=}} [http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1999/apr1999/gr_126545_1999.html] [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/..%5Csyllabi99%5CApril%5C126545_syl.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that victims can be of any chronological age if their mental age is below the age of consent.&lt;ref name="flalje"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/41260/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012185027/http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/41260/|archivedate=2007-10-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-10-12|df=}} [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/..%5Csyllabi99%5CApril%5C126545_syl.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} {{cite web|url=http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605002946/http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html|archivedate=2013-06-05|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-06-30|df=}} [http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1999/apr1999/gr_126545_1999.html] [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1998/aug1998/gr_126921_1998.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions forbid sexual activity outside of legal marriage completely. The relevant age may also vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions may make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a hard and fast single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a relatively low-level [[misdemeanor]] such as "corruption of a minor", to "statutory rape" (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing).

==Homosexuality==
{{main|Legal status of homosexuality}}
In some states, sex between members of the same sex, or between men, is illegal. In a report done in 2013, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA) indicated that homosexuality is still criminalized in some form in 76 states, with a high concentration of these states in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. Scholars have found that religion plays an important role in the legislation criminalizing sodomy. Countries that are predominately Muslim, for example, are less likely to decriminalize acts of sodomy as these acts are in direct contradiction with Islamic traditions. While quantitative research has not proven a link between the continued criminalization of sodomy and Christianity, there are many Protestant denominations, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, that hold rancorous policies toward homosexuality. While one might expect that the decriminalization of sodomy laws would support the mobilization of lesbian and gay rights, this is not necessarily the case, as there is debate on whether or a direct link exists between the two. In legislation regarding sodomy, there is typically no explicit statements given in the support of gay and lesbian rights since the reforms generally the result of a large emendation to penal code. There is some evidence in support of the opposite effect, as the re-criminalization of sodomy in India in 2013 caused a resurgence of gay rights activism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In studying the changes of sodomy statutes, Frank et al. (2009) found that between 1945 and 2005, “90 percent of all modifications involved liberalization in some way” of non-heterosexual acts. This was seen as evidence of a “sodomy-law reform wave.” During the same period, however, eight countries expanded their laws regarding sodomy. In January 2014, Nigeria expanded their criminalization of homosexuality by passing legislation to enforce more severe penalties including a ban against same-sex marriage and participation in any gay organizations. Sodomy laws, however, are rarely used to penalize consensual acts, involving adults, that occur in private. In the 1970s, the only arrests (in the US) involving consensual, non-heterosexual acts were in public or quasi-public. While many sodomy laws are concerned with sexual acts as opposed to sexual orientations, the legislation is often interpreted as if being gay or lesbian is sufficient enough evidence to deem someone guilty as to having engaged in criminal acts. This led US judges to deny parents' custody of their children, student groups were not granted recognition by university officials, and many legislators were opposed to civil rights bills that included sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many revisions to sodomy laws were not a part of large government transitions, but rather included as a part of other general revisions of criminal legislation. There are two main pathways in which sodomy laws have been decriminalized: judicial invalidation and repeal of the law by vote of legislation. The United States did not decriminalize sodomy nationwide until 2003; however, many states, based on the council of judges and lawyers, did decriminalize sodomy as early as 1961.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cnmMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=laws+involving+homosexuality#v=onepage&amp;q=laws%20involving%20homosexuality&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Lesbian and Gay Activism|website=|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23|isbn=9781409457091|last1=Tremblay|first1=Manon|last2=Paternotte|first2=David|date=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rise of Putin, Russia has seen a resurgence in "religious conservativism" which has resulted in the indirect re-criminalizing homosexuality. An amendment was made to Russian legislation in 2013 that emphasizes the protection of children from information that could be deemed as damaging to their mental health and development. In the amendment to the Federal Law of Russian Federation no. 436-FZ, “propaganda” of non-traditional sexual relationships were classified as harmful, and while the law does not criminalize homosexuality directly, it has created a hostile environment for LGBT activism. The US and Europe have condemned Russia’s actions, but despite the domestic and international pushback, the Russian anti-LGBT propaganda law still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mjgt24&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Love in the Time of Propaganda: Russian Anti-LGBT Laws, the International Legal Response and Future Implications 24 - Minnesota Journal of International Law 2015|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incest==
{{main|Laws regarding incest}}
Sexual activity between family members or close relatives is often considered incest, which is illegal in many jurisdictions, though what constitutes an "incestuous relationship" varies by jurisdiction, and may depend on the type of sexual activity and whether the relationship is one of [[consanguinity]], [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] or other relationship, such as by adoption. In law, the proscribed sexual activity is usually limited to [[sexual intercourse]], though terminology varies, and which in some jurisdictions is limited to penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. Incestuous sexual activity, as defined by each jurisdiction, is usually unlawful irrespective of the consent of the parties and irrespective of their age. This prohibition usually also extends to the marriage of people in the proscribed incestuous relationships.

One author argued that use of particular language devices and rhetoric in the legislation surrounding these laws manipulates the viewer to automatically deem such sexual acts to be immoral and criminal. In this view, the law is attempting to morally control society, which is not one of the purposes of the law. This means that people will condemn those who partake in familial sexual activities, even if all parties are consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour's Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130|year = 2014|last1 = Roffee|first1 = James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female genital mutilation==
{{main|Female genital mutilation}}
Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for female genital mutilation (FGM). FGM is the removal of the genitals in cultures perpetuating male domination. Approximately 125 million girls and women are victims of female genital mutilation throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Issues: Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Payne|first=Richard|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2017|isbn=978-0-13-420205-1|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the practices often being performed to exert control over the sexual behavior of girls and women or as a perceived [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] improvement to the appearance of their [[Sex organ|genitalia]].&lt;ref name="Koroma"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koroma|first=Hannah|title=What is Female Genital Mutilation?|date=30 September 1997|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act77/006/1997/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Female genital mutilation |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Momoh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Momoh|first=Comfort |authorlink=Comfort Momoh |chapter=1: Female Genital Mutilation|title=Female Genital Mutilation |editor-last=Momoh |editor-first=Comfort |publisher=Radcliffe Publishing |year=2005 |pages=5–11|accessdate= November 17, 2012|isbn=978-1-85775-693-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is one of many health organizations that have campaigned against the procedures on behalf of [[human rights]], stating that "FGM has no health benefits" and that it is "a violation of the human rights of girls and women" and "reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes".&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;

Most countries prohibit female genital mutilation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/fgm/fgm.htm Laws of the world on female genital mutilation]&lt;/ref&gt; including prohibiting the procedure to be performed on its citizens and residents while outside their jurisdictions,&lt;ref name=McVeigh&gt;McVeigh, Tracy and Sutton, Tara.

The term '''skin flora''' (also commonly referred to as '''skin microbiota''') refers to the microorganisms which reside on the skin, typically human skin.

Many of them are [[bacterium|bacteria]] of which there are around 1000 species upon human skin from nineteen  [[Phylum|phyla]].&lt;ref name="Grice"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grice EA, Kong HH, Conlan S | year = 2009 | title = Topographical and Temporal Diversity of the Human Skin Microbiome | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5931| pages = 1190–1192 | doi = 10.1126/science.1171700 | pmid = 19478181 | pmc=2805064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"&gt;Pappas S.

ScienceNOW Daily News&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are found in the superficial layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the upper parts of [[hair follicle]]s.

Skin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either [[commensalism|commensal]] (are not harmful to their host) or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient [[pathogenic]] organisms from [[Infection#Colonization|colonizing]] the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cogen AL, Nizet V, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Skin microbiota: a source of disease or defence? | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 158 | issue = 3| pages = 442–55 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08437.x | pmid = 18275522 | pmc=2746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, resident microbes can cause [[skin disease]]s and enter the [[blood system]], creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in [[immunosuppressed]] people.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

A major non-human skin flora is ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[chytrid]] and non-hyphal zoosporic fungus that causes [[chytridiomycosis]], an infectious disease thought to be responsible for the [[decline in amphibian populations]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Species variety==
===Bacteria===
[[image:Staphylococcus epidermidis 01.png|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' one of roughly a thousand [[bacteria]] species present on human [[skin]]. Though usually not [[pathogenic]], it can cause [[skin infection]]s and even life-threatening illnesses in those that are [[immunocompromised]].]]

The estimate of the number of species present on skin bacteria has been radically changed by the use of [[16S ribosomal RNA]] to identify bacterial species present on skin samples direct from their genetic material. Previously such identification had depended upon [[microbiological culture]] upon which many varieties of bacteria did not grow and so were hidden to science.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' were thought from cultural based research to be dominant. However [[16S ribosomal RNA]] research finds that while common, these species make up only 5% of skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Grice08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grice EA, Kong HH, Renaud G, Young AC, Bouffard GG, Blakesley RW, Wolfsberg TG, Turner ML, Segre JA | year = 2008 | title = A diversity profile of the human skin microbiota | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2493393&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Genome Res | volume = 18 | issue = 7| pages = 1043–50 | pmid = 18502944 | doi=10.1101/gr.075549.107 | pmc=2493393}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for [[bacteria]]. Most come from four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).
[[File:Skin Microbiome20161-300.jpg|thumb|ecology of the 20 sites on the skin studied in the Human Microbiome Project]]

There are three main ecological areas: sebaceous, moist, and dry. ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' and ''[[Staphylococci]]'' species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. In moist places on the body ''[[Corynebacteria]]'' together with ''[[Staphylococci]]'' dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]] are dominant. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry one. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside the nostril), and on the back.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

===Fungal===
A study of the area between toes in 100 young adults found 14 different genera of fungi. These include [[yeast]]s such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula rubra]]'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', [[dermatophytes]] (skin living fungi) such as ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'',  and ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' and [[nondermatophyte]] fungi (opportunistic fungi that can live in skin) such as ''[[Rhizopus stolonifer]]'', ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Scopulariopsis brevicaulis]]'', ''[[Curvularia]]'', ''[[Alternaria alternata]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oyeka CA, Ugwu LO | year = 2002 | title = Fungal flora of human toe webs | url = | journal = Mycoses | volume = 45 | issue = 11–12| pages = 488–91 | pmid = 12472726 | doi=10.1046/j.1439-0507.2002.00796.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], researched the DNA of human skin fungi at 14 different locations on the body. These were the ear canal, between the eyebrows, the back of the head, behind the ear, the heel, toenails, between the toes, forearm, back, groin, nostrils, chest, palm, and the crook of the elbow. The study showed a large fungal diversity across the body, the richest habitat being the heel, which hosts about 80 species of fungi. By way of contrast, there are some 60 species in toenail clippings and 40 between the toes. Other rich areas are the palm, forearm and inside the elbow, with from 18 to 32 species. The head and the trunk hosted between 2 and 10 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22622689 BBC News item]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belly Button Biodiversity Project began at North Carolina State University in early 2011 with two initial groups of 35 and 25 volunteers.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  Volunteers were given sterile cotton swabs and were asked to insert the cotton swabs into their navels, to turn the cotton swab around three times and then return the cotton swab to the researchers in a vial &lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker-Pope|first=Tara|title=What's in Your Belly Button|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/whats-in-your-belly-button/?_r=1|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   that contained a 0.5 ml 10% phosphate saline buffer.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;   Researchers at North Carolina State University, led by Jiri Hulcr,&lt;ref name="Nierenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nierenberg|first=Cari|title=New meaning to 'navel-gazing': Scientists study Belly Button Bacteria|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-meaning-navel-gazing-scientists-study-belly-button-bacteria-1C6437445?franchiseSlug=healthmain|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  then grew the samples in a culture until the bacterial colonies were large enough to be photographed and then these pictures were posted on the Belly Button Biodiversity Project’s  website (volunteers were given sample numbers so that they could view their own samples online).&lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"/&gt;  These samples then were analyzed using 16S rDNA libraries so that strains that did not grow well in cultures could be identified.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

The researchers at North Carolina State University discovered that while it was difficult to predict every strain of bacteria in the microbiome of the navel that they could predict which strains would be prevalent and which strains of bacteria would be quite rare in the microbiome.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  It was found that the navel microbiomes only contained a few prevalent types of bacteria (Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Actinobacteria, Clostridiales, and Bacilli) and many different types of rare bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt; Other types of rare organisms were discovered inside the navels of the volunteers including three types of Archaea (an organism that usually lives in only extreme environments){{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} and two of the three types of Archaea were found in one volunteer who claimed not to have bathed or showered for many years.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

''Staphylococcus'' and ''Corynebacterium'' were among the most common types of bacteria found in the navels of this project’s volunteers and these types of bacteria have been found to be the most common types of bacteria found on the human skin in larger studies of the skin microbiome  &lt;ref name="Callewaert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callewaert|first=Chris|author2=Frederiek-Maarten Kerckhof |author3=Michael S.

According to the Belly Button Biodiversity Project &lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  at North Carolina State University, there are two types of microorganisms found in the navel and surrounding areas. Transient bacteria (bacteria that does not reproduce) &lt;ref name="Kong"/&gt;    forms  the majority of the organisms found in the navel, and an estimated 1400 various strains were found in 95% of participants of the study.&lt;ref name="saunders-blog"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Saunders| first = Chris| title = Navel gazing at NC State leads to important discovery| work = Red &amp; White for Life :: NC State University Alumni Association| accessdate = 2013-04-20| date = 2011-07-12| url = http://www.alumniblog.ncsu.edu/2011/07/12/navel-gazing-at-nc-state-leads-to-important-discovery/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to host ==
Skin microflora can be [[commensalism|commensal]]s, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[pathogen]]s. Often they can be all three depending upon the strength of the person's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; Research upon the immune system in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] and [[lungs]] has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is an example of a mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause [[dermatitis]]. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as [[Mupirocin]]). This works against  [[staphylococcal]] and [[streptococcal]] infections.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of [[fungus]] species such as ''[[Candida krusei]]'', ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Torulopsis glabrata]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kerr JR | year = 1994 | title = Suppression of fungal growth exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=263067&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 525–7 | pmid = 8150966 | pmc=263067}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also inhibit the growth of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krausse R, Piening K, Ullmann U | year = 2005 | title = Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori | url = | journal = Lett Appl Microbiol | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 81–6 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2004.01632.x | pmid = 15613007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that "removing ''P. aeruginosa'' from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection."&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

Another aspect of bacteria is the generation of [[body odor]]. [[Sweat]] is odorless however several bacteria may consume it and create byproducts which may be considered putrid by man (as in contrast to flies, for example, that may find them attractive/appealing).
Several examples are:
* ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' in  adolescent and adult sebaceous glands can turn its [[amino acid]]s into [[propionic acid]].
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' creates body odor by breaking sweat into [[isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, etal |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can. J. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=357–64 |year=2006 |pmid=16699586 |doi=10.1139/w05-130 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' creates strong foot odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, Koike K, Okisaka K, Hagura T, Kamiya T, Tomita F | year = 2006 | title = Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control | url = | journal = Can J Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 357–64 | pmid = 16699586 | doi=10.1139/w05-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin defenses==
===Antimicrobial peptides===
The skin creates [[antimicrobial peptides]] such as [[cathelicidin]]s  that control the proliferation of skin microbes. Cathelicidins not only reduce microbe numbers directly but also cause the secretion of [[cytokine]] release which induces [[inflammation]], [[angiogenesis]], and [[reepithelialization]]. Conditions such as [[atopic dermatitis]] have been linked to the suppression in cathelicidin production. In [[rosacea]] abnormal processing of cathelicidin cause inflammation. [[Psoriasis]] has been linked to self-DNA created from cathelicidin peptides that causes [[Autoimmunity|autoinflammation]]. A major factor controlling cathelicidin is [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schauber J, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Antimicrobial peptides and the skin immune defense system | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2639779&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Allergy Clin Immunol | volume = 122 | issue = 2| pages = 261–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.03.027 | pmid = 18439663 | pmc=2639779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acidity===
The superficial layers of the skin are naturally acidic ([[pH]] 4-4.5) due to lactic acid in [[sweat]] and produced by skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Lambers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambers H, Piessens S, Bloem A, Pronk H, Finkel P | year = 2006 | title = Natural skin surface pH is on average below 5, which is beneficial for its resident flora | url = | journal = Int J Cosmet Sci. | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 359–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x | pmid = 18489300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this pH mutualistic flora such as ''[[Staphylococci]]'', ''[[Micrococci]]'', ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' grow but not transient bacteria such as [[Gram negative bacteria]] like ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or [[Gram positive]] ones such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; Another factor affecting the growth of pathological bacteria is that the antimicrobial substances secreted by the skin are enhanced in acidic conditions.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; In alkaline conditions, bacteria cease to be attached to the skin and are more readily shed. It has been observed that the skin also swells  under alkaline conditions and opens up allowing move to the surface.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt;

===Immune system===
If activated, the [[immune system]] in the skin produces [[cell-mediated immunity]] against microbes such as [[dermatophyte]]s (skin fungi).&lt;ref name="Dahl"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahl MV | year = 1993 | title = Suppression of immunity and inflammation by products produced by dermatophytes | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 28 | issue = 5 Pt 1| pages = S19–S23 | pmid = 8496406 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(09)80303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction is to increase [[stratum corneum]] turnover and so shed the fungus from the skin surface. Skin fungi such as ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' have evolved to create substances that limit the immune response to them.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt; The shedding of skin is a general means to control the buildup of flora upon the skin surface.

===Acne vulgaris===
[[Acne vulgaris]] is a common skin condition characterised by excessive sebum production by the [[sebaceous gland|pilosebaceous unit]] and inflammation of the skin.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitz-Gibbon|first1=S|last2=Shuta|first2=T|last3=Bor-Han|first3=C|last4=Nguyen|first4=L|last5=Du|first5=C|last6=Minghsun|first6=L|last7=Elashoff|first7=D|last8=Erfe|first8=MC|last9=Loncaric|first9=A|last10=Kim|first10=J|last11=Modlin|first11=RL|last12=Miller|first12=JF|last13=Sodergren|first13=E|last14=Craft|first14=N|last15=Weinstock|first15=GM|last16=Li|first16=H|title=''Propionibacterium acnes'' Strain Populations in the Human Skin Microbiome Associated with Acne|journal=J Invest Dermatol|date=2013|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2152–2160|doi=10.1038/jid.2013.21|pmid=23337890|url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v133/n9/full/jid201321a.html|pmc=3745799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected areas are typically colonised by ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]''; a member of the [[Commensalism|commensal]] microbiota even in those without acne.&lt;ref name="Grice2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grice|first1=EA|title=The skin microbiome: potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cutaneous disease|journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg.|date=2014|volume=33|issue=2|pages=98–103|pmid=25085669|pmc=4425451|url=http://www.edermatologynews.com/scms-journal/volume-33/june-precision-medicine/single-view/the-skin-microbiome-potential-for-novel-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-approaches-to-cutaneous-disease/9077f05398694bf23b88073641fcfa8d.html|doi=10.12788/j.sder.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; High populations of ''P. acnes'' are linked to acne vulgaris although only certain strains are strongly associated with acne while others with healthy skin. The relative population of ''P. acnes'' is similar between those with acne and those without.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;

Current treatment includes topical and systemic antibacterial drugs which result in decreased ''P. acnes'' colonisation and/or activity.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannigan|first1=GD|last2=Grice|first2=EA|title=Microbial ecology of the skin in the era of metagenomics and molecular microbiology|journal=Cold Spring Harb Perpect Med|date=2013|volume=3|issue=12|page=a015362|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a015362|pmid=24296350|pmc=3839604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatment includes the use of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth. ''S. epidermidis'' produces [[succinic acid]] which has been shown to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muya|first1=S|last2=Wang|first2=Y|last3=Yu|first3=J|last4=Kuo|first4=S|last5=Coda|first5=A|last6=Jiang|first6=Y|last7=Gallo|first7=RL|last8=Huang|first8=CM|title=Fermentation of ''Propionibacterium acnes'', a Commensal Bacterium in the Human Skin Microbiome, as Skin Probiotics against Methicillin-Resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=2|page=e55380|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055380|pmc=3566139|pmid=23405142}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' has also been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory and improve antimicrobial properties of the skin when applied topically. It was also shown to be effective in reducing acne lesion size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muizzuddin|first1=N|last2=Maher|first2=W|last3=Sullivan|first3=M|last4=Schnittger|first4=S|last5=Mammone|first5=T|title=Physiological effect of probiotic on skin.|journal=J Cosmet Sci|date=2012|volume=63|issue=6|pages=385–95|pmid=23286870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atopic Dermatitis===
Individuals with [[atopic dermatitis]] have shown an increase in populations of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in both [[lesion]]al and nonlesional skin.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Atopic dermatitis flares are associated with low bacterial diversity due to colonisation by ''S. aureus'' and following [[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|standard treatment]], bacterial diversity has been seen to increase.

[[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|Current treatments]] include combinations of topical or systemic antibiotics, [[corticosteroids]], and diluted bleach baths.&lt;ref name="Kong2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=HH|last2=Oh|first2=J|last3=Deming|first3=C|last4=Conlan|first4=S|last5=Grice|first5=EA|last6=Beatson|first6=MA|last7=Nomicos|first7=E|last8=Polley|first8=EC|last9=Komarow|first9=HD|last10=NISC Comparative Sequence Program|last11=Murray|first11=PR|last12=Turner|first12=ML|last13=Segre|first13=JA|title=Temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with atopic dermatitis|journal=Genome Res|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=850–9|doi=10.1101/gr.131029.111|pmid=22310478|pmc=3337431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatments include using the commensal skin bacteria, ''S. epidermidis'', to inhibit ''S. aureus'' growth. During atopic dermatitis flares, population levels of ''S. epidermidis'' has been shown to increase as an attempt to control ''S. aureus populations''.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2012" /&gt;

Low [[Gut flora|gut microbial]] diversity in babies has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahamsson|first1=TR|last2=Jakobsson|first2=HE|last3=Andersson|first3=AF|last4=Björkstén|first4=B|last5=Engstrand|first5=L|last6=Jenmalm|first6=MC|title=Low diversity of the gut microbiota in infants with atopic eczema|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol|date=2012|volume=129|issue=2|pages=434–40, 440.e1–2|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.025|pmid=22153774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants with atopic eczema have low levels of ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and high levels of [[Firmicutes]]. ''Bacteroides'' have anti-inflammatory properties which are essential against dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012" /&gt; (See [[gut microbiota]])

===Psoriasis vulgaris===
[[Psoriasis|Psoriasis vulgaris]] typically affects drier skin sites such as elbows and knees. Dry areas of the skin tend to have high microbial diversity and fewer populations than sebaceous sites.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013" /&gt; A study using [[Cotton swab#Usage|swab sampling techniques]] show areas rich in [[Firmicutes]] (mainly ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'') and [[Actinobacteria]] (mainly ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacterium]]'') are associated with psoriasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alekseyenko|first1=AV|last2=Perez-Perez|first2=GI|last3=De Souza|first3=A|last4=Strober|first4=B|last5=Gao|first5=Z|last6=Bihan|first6=M|last7=Li|first7=K|last8=Methé|first8=BA|last9=Blaser|first9=MJ|title=Community differentiation of the cutaneous microbiota in psoriasis|journal=Microbiome|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|page=31|doi=10.1186/2049-2618-1-31|pmid=24451201|pmc=4177411}}&lt;/ref&gt; While another study using [[biopsy|biopsies]] associate increased levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with healthy skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahlén|first1=A|last2=Engstrand|first2=L|last3=Baker|first3=BS|last4=Powles|first4=A|last5=Fry|first5=L|title=Comparison of bacterial microbiota in skin biopsies from normal and psoriatic skin.|journal=Arch Dermatol Res|date=2012|volume=304|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s00403-011-1189-x|pmid=22065152}}&lt;/ref&gt; However most studies show that individuals affected by psoriasis have a lower microbial diversity in the affected areas.

Treatments for psoriasis include topical agents, phototherapy, and systemic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menter|first1=A|last2=Griffiths|first2=CE|title=Current and future management of psoriasis.|journal=Lancet|date=2007|volume=370|issue=9583|pages=272–84|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61129-5|pmid=17658398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research on the skin microbiota's role in psoriasis is inconsistent therefore there are no potential probiotic treatments.

===Rosacea===
[[Rosacea]] is typically connected to [[sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] sites of the skin. The skin [[mite]] ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'' produce [[lipases]] that allow them to use sebum as a source of food therefore they have a high affinity for sebaceous skin sites. Although it is a part of the commensal skin microbiota, patients affected with rosacea show an increase in ''D. folliculorum'' compared to healthy individuals, suggesting [[pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casas|first1=C|last2=Paul|first2=C|last3=Lahfa|first3=M|last4=Livideanu|first4=B|last5=Lejeune|first5=O|last6=Alvarez-Georges|first6=S|last7=Saint-Martory|first7=C|last8=Degouy|first8=A|last9=Mengeaud|first9=V|last10=Ginisty|first10=H|last11=Durbise|first11=E|last12=Schmitt|first12=AM|last13=Redoulès|first13=D|title=Quantification of ''Demodex folliculorum'' by PCR in rosacea and its relationship to skin innate immune activation.|journal=Exp Dermatol|date=2012|volume=21|issue=12|pages=906–10|doi=10.1111/exd.12030|pmid=23171449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bacillus oleronius]]'', a ''[[Demodex]]'' associated microbe, is not typically found in the commensal skin microbiota but initiates inflammatory pathways whose starting mechanism is similar to rosacea patients.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Populations of ''S. epidermidis'' have also been isolated from pustules of rosacea patients. However it is possible that they were moved by ''Demodex'' to areas that favour growth as ''Demodex'' has shown to transport bacteria around the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarmuda|first1=S|last2=O'Reilly|first2=N|last3=Zaba|first3=R|last4=Jakubowicz|first4=O|last5=Szkaradkiewicz|first5=A|last6=Kavanagh|first6=K|title=Potential role of Demodex mites and bacteria in the induction of rosacea.|journal=J Med Microbiol|date=2012|volume=61|issue=Pt 11|pages=1504–10|doi=10.1099/jmm.0.048090-0|pmid=22933353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current treatments include topical and oral antibiotics and laser therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AF|last2=Tiemstra|first2=JD|title=Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea|journal=J Am Board Fam Pract.|date=2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=214–7|pmid=12038728}}&lt;/ref&gt; As current research has yet to show a clear mechanism for ''Demodex'' influence in rosacea, there are no potential probiotic treatments.

==Clinical==
===Infected devices ===
Skin microbes are a potential source of infected medical devices such as [[catheters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martín-Rabadán P, Gijón P, Alcalá L, Rodríguez-Créixems M, Alvarado N, Bouza E | year = 2008 | title = Propionibacterium acnes is a common colonizer of intravascular catheters | url = | journal = J Infect | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 257–60 | doi = 10.1016/j.jinf.2008.01.012 | pmid = 18336916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
It is important to note that the human skin is host to numerous bacterial and fungal species, some of which are known to be harmful, some known to be beneficial and the vast majority unresearched. The use of bactericidal and fungicidal soaps will inevitably lead to bacterial and fungal populations which are resistant to the chemicals employed. (see [[Drug resistance]])

===Contagion===
Skin flora do not readily pass between people: 30 seconds of  moderate friction and dry hand contact results in a transfer of only  0.07% of natural hand flora from naked with a greater percentage from gloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lingaas E, Fagernes M | year = 2009 | title = Development of a method to measure bacterial transfer from hands | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 43–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhin.2009.01.022 | pmid = 19282052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal===
The most effective (60 to 80% reduction) antimicrobial washing is with [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], and [[n-propanol]]. [[Viruses]] are most affected by high (95%) concentrations of ethanol, while bacteria are more affected by  n-propanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kampf G, Kramer A | year = 2004 | title = Epidemiologic background of hand hygiene and evaluation of the most important agents for scrubs and rubs | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=523567&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 863–93 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.17.4.863-893.2004 | pmid = 15489352 | pmc=523567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmedicated soaps are not very effective as illustrated by the following data. Health care workers washed their hands once in nonmedicated liquid soap for 30 seconds. The students/technicians for 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borges LF, Silva BL, Gontijo Filho PP | year = 2007 | title = Hand washing: changes in the skin flora | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 417–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.07.012 | pmid = 17660014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important use of [[hand washing]] is to prevent the [[Nosocomial infection#Transmission|transmission]] of [[antibiotic resistant]] skin flora that cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]. While such flora have become antibiotic resistant due to antibiotics there is no evidence that recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms when used in hand washing.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber DJ, Rutala WA |title=Use of germicides in the home and the healthcare setting: is there a relationship between germicide use and antibiotic resistance? |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1107–19 |year=2006 |pmid=17006819 |doi=10.1086/507964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many strains of organisms are resistant to some of the substances used in antibacterial soaps such as [[Triclosan]].&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

One survey of [[soap|bar soaps]] in dentist clinics found they all had their own flora and on average from two to five different genera of microorganisms with those used most more likely to have more species varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hegde PP, Andrade AT, Bhat K | year = 2006 | title = Microbial contamination of "in use" bar soap in dental clinics | url = http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2006;volume=17;issue=2;spage=70;epage=3;aulast=Hegde | journal = Indian J Dent Res | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 70–3 | pmid = 17051871 | doi=10.4103/0970-9290.29888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey of bar soaps in public toilets found even more flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kabara JJ, Brady MB | year = 1984 | title = Contamination of bar soaps under "in-use" conditions | url = | journal = J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol | volume = 5 | issue = 4–5| pages = 1–14 | pmid = 6394740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that very dry soaps are not infected while all are that rest in pools of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Afolabi BA, Oduyebo OO, Ogunsola FT | year = 2007 | title = Bacterial flora of commonly used soaps in three hospitals in Nigeria | url = | journal = East Afr Med J | volume = 84 | issue = 10| pages = 489–95 | pmid = 18232270 | doi=10.4314/eamj.v84i10.9567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, research upon soap that was specially infected found that soap flora do not transmit to the hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinze JE, Yackovich F | year = 1988 | title = Washing with contaminated bar soap is unlikely to transfer bacteria | url = | journal = Epidemiol Infect | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 135–42 | pmid = 3402545 | pmc=2249330 | doi=10.1017/s0950268800029290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damaged skin===
Washing skin repeatedly can damage the protective external layer and cause transepidermal loss of water. This can be seen in roughness characterized by scaling and dryness, itchiness, [[dermatitis]] provoked by microorganisms and [[allergen]]s penetrating the corneal layer and redness. Wearing gloves can cause further problems since it produces a humid environment favoring the growth of microbes and also contains irritants such as [[latex]] and [[talcum powder]].&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larson EL, Hughes CA, Pyrek JD, Sparks SM, Cagatay EU, Bartkus JM | year = 1998 | title = Changes in bacterial flora associated with skin damage on hands of health care personnel | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 513–21 | pmid = 9795681 | doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand washing can damage skin because the [[stratum corneum]] top layer of skin consists of 15 to 20 layers of [[keratin]] disks, [[corneocyte]]s, each of which is each surrounded by a thin film of skin [[lipid]]s which can be removed by [[alcohol]]s and [[detergent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kownatzki E | year = 2003 | title = Hand hygiene and skin health | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 239–45 | pmid = 14629966 | doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2003.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged skin defined  by extensive cracking of skin surface, widespread reddening or occasional bleeding has also been found to be more frequently colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus hominis]]'' and these were more likely to be [[methicillin]] resistant.&lt;ref name="Larson" /&gt; Though not related to greater antibiotic resistance, damaged skin was also more like to be colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[gram-negative bacteria]], ''[[Enterococci]]'' and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;

==Comparison with other flora==
The skin flora is different from that of the gut which is  predominantly [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eckburg PB, Bik EM, Bernstein CN, Purdom E, Dethlefsen L, Sargent M, Gill SR, Nelson KE, Relman DA | year = 2005 | title = Diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1395357&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728| pages = 1635–8 | doi = 10.1126/science.1110591 | pmid = 15831718 | pmc=1395357}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also low level of variation between people that is not found in gut studies.&lt;ref name="Grice08"/&gt; Both gut and skin flora however lack the diversity found in [[soil flora]].&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

'''Sociology of food''' is the study of [[food]] as it relates to the history, progression, and future development of [[society]]. This includes production, consumption, distribution, conflict, medical application, ritual, spiritual, ethical, and cultural applications, environmental and labor issues.

The aspect of food distribution in our society can be examined through the analysis of the changes in the food supply chain. Globalization in particular, has significant effects on the food supply chain by enabling scale effect in the food distribution industry.

== Food Distribution ==

=== Impact from scale effects ===
[[Scale effects]] resulting from centralized acquisition purchase centres in the food supply chain favor large players such as big retailers or distributors in the food distribution market. This is due to the fact that they can utilize their strong market power and financial advantage over smaller players. Having both strong market power and greater access to the financial credit market meant that they can impose barriers to entry and cement their position in the food distribution market. This would result in a food distribution chain that is characterized by large players on one end and small players choosing niche markets to operate in on the other end. The existence of smaller players in specialized food distribution markets could be attributed to their shrinking market share and their inability to compete with the larger players due to the scale effects. Through this mechanism, globalization has displaced smaller role players.&lt;ref&gt;MANUEL BELO MOREIRA, Changes in Food Chains in the Context of Globalization, Int. Jrnl. of Soc. of Agr. &amp; Food, Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 134–148&lt;/ref&gt;
Another mechanism troubling the specialized food distribution markets is the ability of distribution chains to possess their own brand. Stores with their own brand are able to combat price wars between competitors by lowering the price of their own brand, thus making consumers more likely to purchase goods from them.&lt;ref&gt;Vizard, Sarah. "Supermarkets' new price war risks damaging relations with food brands and consumers." Marketing Week Online 24 Apr. 2014. General OneFile. Web. 5 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early History and Culture===
Since the beginning of mankind, food was important simply for the purpose of nourishment. As primates walked the Earth, they solely consumed food for a source of energy as they had to hunt and forage because food was not easily on hand. By early humans fending for themselves, they had figured out that they needed a high energy diet to keep going on a daily basis to survive.

These developments eventually lead to agriculture, which also goes into the labor for food and the economic part of the sociology of food. As the years went on, food become more and more of a way to bring cultures and people together. In many cultures, food is what brings people together. This carried for centuries. From the homo-sapiens hunting and gathering, to the colonists to the New World sharing a feast with the Native Americans (that carried on as a tradition named Thanksgiving), to the popularization of restaurants/eating out in the last several decades and the togetherness that comes with eating, shows how the communication and connectivity that comes from it. According to sociologists there are different groups of food that are divided up due to their purpose and meaning. There are cultural super foods, which are the stables for a culture. There are prestige foods, which often reflects economic status, body image food which is mainly consumed for the good of the body. Another would be sympathetic foods that are eaten for their desirable properties, like a superstitious property.  Lastly, there is physiologic group, which are consumed for a specific category (like what a pregnant woman eats for a healthy pregnancy). These different categories help researchers and sociologists study culture in the perspective of food. It often shows how food grows, molds and changes with society. For example, if someone believes in homeopathy, that would fall under the sympathetic foods or physiologic foods. This is because they are consumed for their properties and beliefs of what it could do. Another example of one of these categories of foods would be caviar or oysters for the prestige foods, because they are often more expensive and those who consume it and purchase it do so to show their socioeconomic status, or [[Socioeconomic status|SES]].

=== Sociological Perspectives ===
Through the lens of a symbolic interactionist, there are many symbols that have to do with the sociology of food. Food, in many cultures, brings people together and connects them on multiple different levels. For example, the tradition of eating with the family around the table. It represents togetherness with one and another and communication. Food itself could symbolize something greater than what it is. In America, fast food could represent the busy family that needs a quick dinner to some. To others, however, it could display the “McDonaldization Theory” which centers around the idea of, specifically American, consumption. Another example of how the sociology of food can be symbolized would be making the food from scratch. This definitely goes along with the family. With other theories of sociology, conflict theory also pertains to the sociology of food. As mentioned before, food was first and foremost used for nourishment and means of survival. Due to this, that can fall under conflict theory. The roles of the hunter and gather meant that early humans had to fight and forage to survive. The conflict could also display the survival of the fittest, because there was a conflict for getting food and nourishment, the only the ones who were to best for prevail and provide nourishment for themselves and their families. This evolved to what it is today, with people having jobs to make a living for themselves, which goes into food and nourishment.

=== Psychology and Disorders ===
Eating disorders are also symbolic with the sociology of food. They represent how control (or lack thereof) someone can have over themselves about one of the things they need to live. Eating disorders do not limit themselves to anorexia. These disorders include bulimia and binge eating as well. Some people often use food a comfort, or even a reward. Or in other cases they see food as a negative thing to avoid, even though they need it for survival. The relationships with food that people carry is a very large subject that is very complex. From a sociological standpoint, media has a lot to do with this. Not only does this have to with the sociology of food, but it has to do with how the media represents society as a whole. Both men and women, but majority women, see the representation on the media, leading them to wanting to feel attractive. A lot of the time, this comes down the person’s relationship with food. When someone has a disorder like [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia nervousa]] or [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], they have an intense fear of gaining weight, or just the “fatness” they feel they would get by consuming food. With bulimia, the fear is there, with the overcoming urge to binge. These disorders display the psychological relationships that people could have with food, and view it as a negative thing. They focus on the material look of themselves as opposed to needing food for energy and nourishment. This has a lot to do with overwhelming sexuality in the media. Girls, young women, and even men see how they “should” look according to the media, making them turn to desperate measures with these eating disorders.

=== Dieting ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}The fad of diets have been around for centuries, but the obsession with being thin and slim is only recently became a hot topic, within the last century. Dating back to even before the renaissance, it was considered beautiful to be “plump” and curvy. Society during that time in history believed that if a woman was larger and more plump, then she was being taken care of. It showed her wealth because she could afford to eat, as opposed to a peasant who did not have the luxury to readily available meals. The desired woman was not stick thin. The notable change began in the 1920s era were the “boyish” figure became the most desired for a woman. Later, going into the 1960s, models like Twiggy made headlines about how thin she was, and many women strived to be like her body type. This carried on to the 1980s where dieting (like the South Beach Diet and Weight Watchers) grew in popularity, along with the popularization of working out and work out videos. This was the start of mainstream dieting fads. Among these, others like the [[Atkins diet]], Jenny Craig, and [[Paleolithic diet|paleo]] began to take popularity. As of early-mid-2010s, other diets became mainstream. This included vegetarianism, dairy-free, [[veganism]], raw diets, and gluten-free. There are many reasons why someone would choose a certain type of diet: moral reasons, digestive issues, outside influence, or religious influence.

=== Obesity===
The obesity epidemic that has spread across America also is a great example on how food shapes society and they way people live, along with the evolution of  the type of food Americans consume. Due to the busy manic lives that many Americans have, fast food and prepackaged foods with higher calories have gained popularity and have become mainstream in American consumption. The environment in which people with certain socioeconomic backgrounds live also heavily affect the type of food they consume. High calorie and low nutritional food tend to be less expensive and are easier to access. Thus, when shopping for food many lean towards the cheaper options. Lack of physical fitness is also a crucial aspect that is adding to the obesity epidemic. Studies have found that there is a direct correlation between walkability in neighborhoods and exercise. Also, if one's neighborhood does not have ready access to recreation activities they are at risk of becoming over weight and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SALLIS|first=JAMES F.|last2=GLANZ|first2=KAREN|date=2009-03|title=Physical Activity and Food Environments: Solutions to the Obesity Epidemic|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=123–154|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00550.x|issn=0887-378X|pmc=2879180|pmid=19298418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going along with the subject of eating disorders, obesity could have to do with the feeling of lack of control that comes with over eating. There has been progress on combating America's obesity problem, with programs being put in place to help promote healthy eating and fitness. More and more restaurants are putting the amount of calories that are in the meals.  Also, many food companies such as Coca-Cola are promoting making healthy choices with their drinks and products, also putting the calories on them and making the nutrition facts readily available.

{{unreferenced|date=March 2012}}
'''Star counts''' are bookkeeping surveys of [[star]]s and the [[statistics|statistical]] and [[geometry|geometrical]] methods used to correct the survey data for [[Wiktionary:bias#Etymology|bias]]. The surveys are most often made of nearby stars in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].

One of the interests of astronomy is to determine how many stars there are of each of several types that stars can be categorized into, and how these stars are distributed in space.

==Reasons for star counts==
When performing star counts, astronomers consider many different categories that have been created to classify a few stars that have been well studied. One of the hopes of studying the results of star counts is to discover new categories. Different counts typically seek to categorize stars for only a few of the qualities listed below, and determine how common each considered quality is and how stars of that kind are distributed.

* '''Temperature''': In astronomy, temperature is usually shown using the [[spectral type|letter codes]] '''O B A F G K M''' running from 'blue' (type&amp;nbsp;'''O''', actually bluish white) through white (type&amp;nbsp;'''F''') to 'red' (type&amp;nbsp;'''M''', actually ruddy orange). Types&amp;nbsp;'''L''' and '''T''' are used for [[brown dwarfs]], whose 'colors' are in the [[infrared]].
* '''Size''': Size is usually designated by Roman numerals '''I''' ([[supergiants]]) through '''V''' (dwarfs).
* '''Age''': Stars are usually grouped into ''Population&amp;nbsp;I'' (young) and ''Population&amp;nbsp;II'' (old).
* '''Location''': In the Milky Way Galaxy the groups are described as ''[[Thin disk population|thin disk]]'', ''thick disk'', ''central bulge'', and ''halo''.
* '''Multiplicity''': Most stars are members of double star, or triple star, or even double-double star systems. Our own sun appears to be unusual for ''not'' having a companion star.

There are many finer subdivisions in all of the above categories.

==Bias==
There are many unavoidable problems in counting stars for the purpose of getting an accurate picture of the distribution of stars in space. The effects of our point of view in the galaxy, the obscuring clouds of gas and dust in the galaxy, and especially the extreme range of inherent brightness, create a biased view of stars.

* Stars vary far more in [[Wiktionary:intrinsic#Etymology|intrinsic]] brightness than they do in distance.
* Our line of sight through the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] is interrupted by great clouds of gas and dust, which block our view of stars more than a few thousand [[light-year]]s away.
* The [[Sun]] is located in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy, in the northern edge of the ''thin disk'' and on the inner edge of a [[spiral arm]] called the [[Orion Arm|Orion–Cygnus Arm]]. There is good reason to believe that stars in the galaxy's thin disk are different from thicker part of the disk, and from the bulge and the halo. Some stars are obviously more common in spiral arms than in the disk in between the arms.

Knowing that these effects create bias, astronomers analyzing star counts attempt to find how much bias each effect has caused and then compensate for it as well as they can.

==Inherent luminosity complications==
The greatest problem biasing star counts is the extreme differences in inherent brightness of different sizes.

Heavy, bright stars (both [[giant stars|giants]] and blue [[dwarf star|dwarfs]]) are the most common stars listed in general [[star catalog]]s, even though on average they are obviously rare in space. Small dim stars ([[red dwarf]]s) seem to be the most common stars in space, at least locally, but can only be seen with large telescopes, and then only when they are within a few tens of light-years from Earth.

For example, the [[blue giant]] [[zeta Puppis|ζ&amp;nbsp;Puppis]] is 400&amp;nbsp;million times more [[luminosity|luminous]] than the nearest star, a [[red dwarf]] named [[Alpha Centauri|Proxima]], or ''[[Alpha centauri|α&amp;nbsp;Centauri]]&amp;nbsp;C''. Even though Proxima is only 4.2&amp;nbsp;light-years away from us, it is so dim that it cannot be seen with the naked eye (one of its companions, ''α&amp;nbsp;Centauri&amp;nbsp;A'', is visible). The star ''ζ&amp;nbsp;Puppis'' is one of the brightest of the visible extreme blue supergiants. It is so bright that it appears to be a second magnitude star, even though ζ Puppis is 1,399 light-years away.

'''Start Making A Reader Today''' (SMART) is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven tutoring program local to [[Oregon]] for at-risk K-3 readers. SMART was developed by [[Neil Goldschmidt]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Baker, Scott, Russell Gersten and Thomas Keating. ''[http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Reading%20Research%20Quarterly%20Dec%20%2700.pdf When less may be more: A 2-year longitudinal evaluation of a volunteer tutoring program requiring minimal training]''. Reading Research Quarterly, Volume 35, Number 4; Oct-Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It has grown from serving 585 children at 8 schools at its inception&lt;ref name="programOverview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview|publisher=SMART|url=http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Program%20Overview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serving 7,244 children at 204 sites in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://getsmartoregon.org/aboutus/documents/SMART%20Annual%20Report%20FY09.pdf Smart Annual Report 2008-2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and 223 sites in 2011.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;  As of December 2011, the organization's annual budget was $2.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Row|first=D.K.|title=Getting SMART about success|date=December 16, 2011&lt;!--(online date Dec. 15)--&gt;|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=E1|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/living/index.ssf/2011/12/getting_smart_about_success.html |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program concept involves each student getting one-on-one attention twice a week for 30 minutes as they read to a volunteer to help boost their confidence in their reading ability. Additionally, the students get to take two books home each month over the seven months the program runs each year (mid-October to mid-May), in order to make more reading material available at home.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;

The program's effectiveness is backed by a [[Longitudinal study|two-year study]] performed at the Eugene Research Institute which indicates SMART students outperform similar students in word identification and word comprehension by nearly a half [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/wordpress/?page_id=85 Social Programs That Work: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

SMART aims to partner foremost with schools that have a high percentage of children from [[Poverty|low-income]] families. School staff interviews, community support, and information from the [[Oregon Department of Education]] also influence school selection.&lt;ref name="programOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SMART participated in [[Pepsi]]'s Refresh Challenge and running for the $250,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refresheverything.com/smartreading Pepsi Refresh Challenge: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biblical studies]], the '''supplementary hypothesis''' proposes that the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the bible) was derived from a series of direct additions to an existing corpus of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a revision to the earlier [[documentary hypothesis]], which proposed that independent and complete narratives were later combined by redactors to create the Pentateuch.

The supplementary hypothesis was developed over the 19th and 20th centuries, primarily deriving from a dissatisfaction with the adequacy of the documentary hypothesis, and came to a head in the 1970s with the publication of works by [[John Van Seters]], [[Rolf Rendtorff]], and [[Hans Heinrich Schmid]]. In their book, ''An Introduction to the Bible'', Kugler and Hartin argue that "the work of John Van Seters best reflects the revival of the supplementary hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kugler &amp; Hartin|title=An Introduction to the Bible|date=2009|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] |location=Cambridge|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Seters’ summation of the hypothesis accepts "three sources or literary strata within the Pentateuch," which have come to be known as the [[Yahwist]] (J), the [[Priestly source|Priestly Writer]] (P), and the [[Deuteronomist]] (D). Van Seters ordered the sources chronologically as DJP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the Deuteronomist source (D) was likely written c. 700 BCE.
* the Yahwist source (J) was likely written c. 600 BCE in the [[exilic]] period.
* the Priestly source (P) was likely  written c. 400 BCE in the [[post-exilic]] period.

While the hypothesis is not the only revision of the documentary hypothesis to be made, it is one of the few at the forefront of Pentateuch studies and has been suggested by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaron|first1=David H.|title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue|date=2006|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

While documentarians originally placed the authorship of the Pentateuch in the 10th to the 7th centuries BCE, the supplementary hypothesis places the authorship of the Pentateuch later in the seventh to fifth centuries. A major driver of this reassessment has been the evolving understanding of the historical context of the early Israelites. Biblical estimates put the earliest activity of the Israelites in Canaan in the 13th century, with [[Joshua]]'s conquest. However, archeologists have found no evidence of a distinct Israelite people in the region at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein &amp; Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, archaeologists have found that most of the places referred to by name in the Bible, most notably [[Jerusalem]], reflect the realities of the 7th century, much later. If, as the archeological evidence would suggest, there was no distinct group of "Israelite" people until the seventh century, the authorship of the Pentateuch is likely to have occurred in the 7th century and later. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein &amp; Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archeological findings have caused recent Pentateuch scholars to reject earlier documentarian claims of 10th-century authorship, in favor of later authorship, as reflected in the supplementary hypothesis.

== Major divergences from the documentary hypothesis ==
[[Julius Wellhausen]], the leading proponent of the documentary hypothesis, proposed that the Pentateuch is the amalgamation of four independent and complete narratives which were combined by redactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horton|first1=Fred L.|title=A Basic Vocabulary of Biblical Studies for Beginning Students: A Work in Progress|date=2007|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supplementary hypothesis, as outlined by Van Seters, differs from it in three major ways:

=== The existence of the Elohist (E) source ===

The supplementary hypothesis denies the existence of an extensive Elohist (E) source, one of the four independent sources described in the documentary hypothesis. Instead, it describes the Yahwist as having borrowed from an array of written and oral traditions, combining them into the J source. It proposes that because J is compiled from many earlier traditions and stories, documentarians mistook the compilation as having multiple authors: the Yahwist (J) ''and'' the Elohist (E). Instead, the supplementary hypothesis proposes that what documentarians considered J and E are in fact a single source (some use J, some use JE), likely written in the 6th century BCE.

=== The chronology of the sources ===

The supplementary hypothesis proposes that the Deuteronomist (D) was the original, and earliest, Pentateuch writer, having been written at the end of the seventh century, and ascribes the Jahwist (J) to the exilic (c. 540) and the Priestly (P) to the post-exilic (c. 400) periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaron|first1=David H.|title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue|date=2006|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The supplementary hypothesis argues that the Deuteronomist (D) source is of the seventh century BCE. Early Pentateuch scholars, most notably [[Martin Noth]], argued that the Deuteronomist (D) was a single sixth century author explaining the events preceding the Babylonian exile theologically. In 1968 [[Frank Moore Cross]] suggested that Deuteronomist (D) actually originated from "dual-redactors," with the original Deuteronomist (Dtr1) being a seventh century author supporting Josiah's reforms, and Noth's later sixth century Deuteronomist (Dtr2) revising the earlier work, imbuing it with themes of punishment for the sinful as to explain the Babylonian exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richter|first1=Sandra L.|title=The Deuteronomistic history and the name theology|date=2002|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "dual-redactor" view is likely the most common held among scholars today; Van Seters affirmed this view arguing that both the emphasis on seventh century reform and on sixth century exile shows that  "Deuteronomy . . . consists of an older nucleus with later expansions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the documentary hypothesis held that the Yahwist (J) was likely of the 10th century, the supplementary hypothesis puts it much later, in the 6th century, during the exilic period. That reassessment was made largely because of research conducted in the 1970s. A 1976 study by [[Hans Heinrich Schmid]] demonstrated that the Yahwist (J) was aware of earlier religious writings of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, refuting the original assessment of J as a work of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cambell &amp; O'Brien|title=Sources of the Pentateuch: texts, introductions, annotations.|date=1993|publisher=Frotress Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Seters argues that the Yahwist (J) used "fragments, some in literary form, others as popular motifs and stories" to create a theological creation story, expanding upon the Deuteronomist's established corpus of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the post-exilic period, he theorizes that there was an established theological work (DJ) created by the Deutoronomist (D) and Yahwist (J). 

Van Seters argues that the Priestly source (P) is not independent from the Yahwist source (J) but indeed relies heavily upon it. If J is ascribed to the exilic period, P must be of the post-exilic, or [[Second Temple]], period, likely in the 5th century. This reassessment of chronology places the Deuteronomist as the first writer (DJP) whereas the documentary hypothesis places the Deuteronomist as a later writer (JEDP).

=== Independence of the Yahwist and Priestly sources ===

Whereas the documentary hypothesis proposed that the four Pentateuch sources were complete and independent accounts, Van Seters writes that the supplementary hypothesis "does not view the later sources J and P as independent documents but as direct additions to the earlier corpus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis proposed that the Deuteronomist is the only independent source and that the Yahwist (J) is a reply to the Deuteronomic explanation of the Exile and a "confessional reformulation" as a theological corrective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kugler &amp; Hartin|title=An Introduction to the Bible|date=2009|publisher=William B. Eerdman's Publishing Co.|location=Cambridge|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the hypothesis views the Priestly (P) source as non-independent as well. Because many P texts, Van Seters argues, "do not make sense without the larger J context," the Priestly writer is viewed as a redactor of J. A major consequence of this view that the later two sources are not independent is the removal of the need for redactors to explain the cohesion of the Penteteuch. Van Seters writes, “Since there are no separate sources after the first one, there is no need for redactors. The elaborate system of multiple redactors used by current documentarians is unnecessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermoluminescence dating''' ('''TL''') is the determination, by means of measuring the accumulated [[radiation]] dose, of the time elapsed since material containing [[crystal]]line minerals was either [[heat]]ed ([[lava]], [[ceramic]]s) or exposed to sunlight ([[sediment]]s). As a crystalline material is heated during measurements, the process of  [[thermoluminescence]] starts. Thermoluminescence emits a weak light signal that is proportional to the radiation dose absorbed by the material. It is a type of [[luminescence dating]].

The technique has wide application, and is relatively cheap at some US$300–700 per object; ideally a number of samples are tested.  Sediments are more expensive to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smah.uow.edu.au/sees/facilities/UOW002896.html Thermoluminescence (TL) dating] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114336/http://smah.uow.edu.au/sees/facilities/UOW002896.html |date=2015-04-02 }}, University of Wollongong, Australia; [http://daybreaknuclear.us/bortolot_faq.html Daybreak Corporation, FAQs]; [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/luminescence.html Oxford University]; [http://www.oxfordauthentication.com/ Oxford Authentification], see different prices depending on type&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of a relatively significant amount of sample material is necessary, which can be a limitation in the case of artworks. The heating must have taken the object above 500° C, which covers most ceramics, although very high-fired [[porcelain]] creates other difficulties.  It will often work well with stones that have been heated by fire. The clay core of bronze sculptures made by [[lost wax casting]] can also be tested.&lt;ref name="Bortolot 2001"&gt;[http://daybreaknuclear.us/tlpaper.pdf "Thermoluminescence dating of art objects"], V.J. Bortolot, Daybreak Corporation; [http://www.coupdefoudre.com/CurrentArticle/Thermo.html "The Limits of TL", Michel Brent, ''Archaeology Magazine'', Volume 54, Number 1, January/February 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different materials vary considerably in their suitability for the technique, depending on several factors.  Subsequent irradiation, for example if an x-ray is taken, can affect accuracy, as will the "annual dose" of radiation a buried object has received from the surrounding soil. Ideally this is assessed by measurements made at the precise findspot over a long period. For artworks, it may be sufficient to confirm whether a piece is broadly ancient or modern (that is, authentic or a fake), and this may be possible even if a precise date cannot be estimated.&lt;ref name="Bortolot 2001" /&gt;

== Functionality ==
Natural crystalline materials contain imperfections: impurity [[ion]]s, stress dislocations, and other phenomena that disturb the regularity of the [[electric field]] that holds the [[atom]]s in the crystalline lattice together.  These imperfections lead to local humps and dips in the crystalline material's [[electric potential]]. Where there is a dip (a so-called "[[electron]] trap"), a free [[electron]] may be attracted and trapped.

The flux of ionizing radiation&amp;mdash;both from [[cosmic radiation]] and from natural [[radioactivity]]&amp;mdash;excites electrons from atoms in the [[crystal lattice]] into the [[conduction band]] where they can move freely.  Most excited electrons will soon recombine with lattice ions, but some will be trapped, storing part of the [[energy]] of the radiation in the form of trapped [[electric charge]] ('''Figure 1''').

Depending on the depth of the traps (the energy required to free an electron from them) the storage time of trapped electrons will vary as ''some traps are sufficiently deep to store charge for hundreds of thousands of years''.

== In practical use ==
In thermoluminescence dating, these long-term traps are used to determine the age of materials: When irradiated crystalline material is again heated or exposed to strong light, the trapped electrons are given sufficient energy to escape. In the process of recombining with a lattice ion, they lose energy and emit [[photon]]s (light [[quantum|quanta]]), detectable in the [[laboratory]].

The amount of light produced is proportional to the number of trapped electrons that have been freed which is in turn proportional to the radiation dose accumulated. In order to relate the signal (the thermoluminescence&amp;mdash;light produced when the material is heated) to the radiation dose that caused it, it is necessary to [[calibrate]] the material with known doses of radiation since the [[density]] of traps is highly variable.

Thermoluminescence dating presupposes a "zeroing" event in the history of the material, either heating (in the case of pottery or lava) or exposure to sunlight (in the case of sediments), that removes the pre-existing trapped electrons. Therefore, at that point the thermoluminescence signal is zero.

As time goes on, the ionizing radiation field around the material causes the trapped electrons to accumulate ('''Figure 2'''). In the laboratory, the accumulated radiation dose can be measured, but this by itself is insufficient to determine the time since the zeroing event.

The ''Radiation Dose Rate'' - the dose accumulated per year-must be determined first. This is commonly done by measurement of the [[alpha particle|alpha radioactivity]] (the [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] content) and the [[potassium]] content (K-40 is a [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] emitter) of the sample material.

Often the [[gamma radiation]] field at the position of the sample material is measured, or it may be calculated from the alpha radioactivity and potassium content of the sample environment, and the [[cosmic ray]] dose is added in.  Once all components of the radiation field are determined, the accumulated dose from the thermoluminescence measurements is divided by the dose accumulating each year, to obtain the years since the zeroing event.

== Relation to radiocarbon dating ==
Thermoluminescence dating is used for material where [[radiocarbon dating]] is not available, like [[sediment]]s. Its use is now common in the authentication of old ceramic wares, for which it gives the approximate date of the last firing. An example of this can be seen in [http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/079/ant0790390.htm Rink and Bartoll, 2005].

Thermoluminescence dating was modified for use as a ''passive sand migration analysis tool'' by [http://www.jcronline.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.2112%2F04-0406.1 Keizars, ''et al.'', 2008] ('''Figure 3'''), demonstrating the direct consequences resulting from the improper replenishment of starving beaches using fine sands, as well as providing a ''passive'' method of policing [[beach nourishment|sand replenishment]] and observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines ('''Figure 4''').

[[File:Quartz UV NET NTL Curve.svg|thumb|Typical quartz TL curve measured with a UV filter during routine TL dating.]]

== Relation to other luminescence dating methods==
[[Optically stimulated luminescence]] dating is a related measurement method which replaces heating with exposure to intense light.  The sample material is illuminated with a very bright source of green or blue light (for [[quartz]]) or [[infrared light]] (for [[potassium feldspars]]).  [[Ultraviolet light]] emitted by the sample is detected for measurement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6863">'''Tree breeding''' is the application of genetic, reproductive biology and economics principles to the genetic improvement and management of forest trees. In contrast to the selective breeding of livestock, arable crops, and horticultural flowers over the last few centuries, the breeding of trees, with the exception of fruit trees, is a relatively recent occurrence.

A typical forest tree breeding program starts with selection of superior [[phenotype]]s (plus trees) in a natural or planted forest. This application of [[Selection methods in plant breeding based on mode of reproduction#Mass selection|mass selection]] improves the mean performance of the forest. Offspring is obtained from selected trees and grown in test plantations that act as genetic trials. Based on such tests the best genotypes among the parents can be selected. Selected trees are typically multiplied by either seeds or [[grafting]] and [[seed orchard]]s are established when the preferred output is improved seed. Alternatively, the best genotypes can be directly propagated by cuttings or in-vitro methods and used directly in clonal plantations. The first system is frequently used in pines and other conifers, while the second is typical in some broadleaves (poplars, eucalypts and others). The objectives of a tree breeding program range from yield improvement and adaptation to particular conditions, to pest- and disease-resistance, wood properties, etc. Currently, tree breeding starting to take advantage of the fast development in plant genetics and genomics.

==Optimisation==
Tree breeders make efforts to get their operation efficient by optimising tree breeding. Scientists develop tools aimed at improvement of the efficiency of tree breeding programmes. Optimising can mean adapting strategies and methods to certain species, group of populations, structure of genetic variation and mode of inheritance of the important traits to obtain the highest benefit per unit of time. Optimising is usually carried out at the following levels: breeding strategy (appropriate intensity of breeding, breeding population structure and size, plan for maintenance of genetic diversity), breeding methods ([[mating]] type, testing and selection methods, testing population size and time) and deployment methods of the genetically improved material ([[seed orchard]]s&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, D. and Prescher, F. 2005. Optimal clone number for seed orchards with tested clones. Silvae Genetica 54: 80-92.&lt;/ref&gt; and clonal forestry: genetic contribution, size). Computer simulators are frequently used: stochastic – based on defined and random algorithms; and deterministic – based on defined algorithms.

Selection strategies have been compared for annual progress in long-term breeding at a given annual cost considering genetic gain, gene diversity, cost components, and time components. For Norway spruce it seems favourable to clone full sib families and then select based on clonal performance&lt;ref&gt;Danusevičius D &amp; Lindgren D 2002. Efficiency of Selection Based on Phenotype, Clone and Progeny Testing in Long-term Breeding. Silvae Genetica 51:19-26.&lt;/ref&gt; while for Scots pine a two-stage strategy seems best, first phenotypic pre-selection and then progeny-testing the selections.&lt;ref&gt;Danusevičius D &amp; Lindgren D 2002. Two-stage selection strategies in tree breeding considering gain, diversity, time and cost. Forest Genetics. 9:145-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree improvement==

A genetically variable population and a method of selecting genetically superior individuals provide the basis for tree improvement by breeding. In essence, a tree improvement program sets out to isolate and evaluate the genetic component of variation in one or more characters of interest. In the simplest procedure, cycles of selection reduce the available population in a particular direction to enhance desirable traits, then breeding from selections to expand the population with improved characteristics. Breeding strategies vary with species and objectives, but all use mating designs to generate information and new material. Choice of a suitable breeding strategy and mating design is a key decision in any breeding program. Kiss (1986)&lt;ref name="kiss3"&gt;Kiss, G.K. 1986. Genetic improvement of white and Engelmann spruce in British Columbia 1983–85. p. 191–193 ''in ''Yeatman, C.W.; Boyle, T.J.B. (Eds.), Proc. 20th Meet. Can. Tree Improv. Assoc. Part 1, Quebec QC.&lt;/ref&gt; used a 2-level design in British Columbia to study variation within and between separate populations of [[white spruce]], both within British Columbia and from eastern North America.

The breeding program for white spruce initiated in 1986 by the Canadian Forestry Service in the Maritimes employed 2 kinds of mating: polycross, to test clones for general combining ability; and pair-mating, to generate material for second generation selections (Fowler et al. 1988).&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;Fowler, D.P., Bonga, J.M., Park, Y.S., Simpson, J.D., and Smith, R.F. 1988. Tree breeding at the Canadian Forestry Service – Maritimes 1985 and 1986. p. 31–36 ''in'' Morgenstern, E.K.; Boyle, T.J.B. (Eds.). Tree Improvement – Progressing Together Sympos., Truro NS, Aug. 1987. Proc. Part 1, 21st Meet. Can. Tree Improv. Assoc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton’s (2003)&lt;ref name="newton"&gt;Newton, P.F. 2003. Systematic review of yield responses of four North American conifers to forest tree improvement practices. For. Ecol. Manage. 172:29–51.&lt;/ref&gt; systematic review of yield responses of white spruce and 3 other North American [[Pinophyta|conifers]] to forest tree improvement practices indicated that correct provenance-progeny selection could yield juvenile height growth gains of about 12% at 20 years for white spruce, and a corresponding merchantable productivity (mean annual merchantable volume increment) gain of 26% at 50 years for plantations established at nominal initial densities on medium-to-good quality sites. Also, preliminary estimates derived from individual case studies indicated that first generational selection strategies for white spruce could increase merchantable productivity by approximately 20% at 45 years.

The '''United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology''' ('''UNU-IIST'''; {{zh|c=聯合國大學國際軟件技術研究所}}; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Instituto Internacional para Tecnologia de Programação da Universidade das Nações Unidas'') was a [[United Nations University]] Research Training Centre based in [[Macau]], [[China]].

==History==
In 1989, the Council of the [[United Nations University]] decided to establish in Macau the United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST) as a research and training centre of the University. UNU-IIST opened its door in 1992 with the blessing of the governments of [[Portugal]], [[China]] and [[Macau]], also the initial donors of the Institute. As part of the [[United Nations]], the Institute was to address the pressing global problems of human survival, development and welfare by international co-operation, research and advanced training in software technology.

==Recent history during the 2000-2010 decade==
UNU-IIST positions as both a university and an organ of [[United Nations]]. For nearly a generation, it has been committed to providing vital research on critical software systems while mentoring exceptional academics from around the developing world. As the world of [[Information and Communication Technology|information and communication technology (ICT)]] has changed immensely over the decades, it has defined a new mission along with a four-year strategic plan in 2010. The plan calls for UNU-IIST to embark on a more dramatic and focused response to the new computing environment and its potential to serve the cause of [[sustainable development|sustainable development (SD)]].

Eventually, UNU decided to evolve the former IIST into a new [[United Nations University Institute on Computing and Society|Institute on Computing and Society]] (ICS).

==Administration==
The last Director of UNU-IIST was Professor Peter Haddawy.

The '''Violins of Hope''' collection is a collection of [[Holocaust]] related [[string instruments]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. The instruments serve to educate and memorialize the lives of prisoners in [[concentration camps]] through concerts, exhibitions and other projects. The collection is owned by father and son team [[Amnon Weinstein|Amnon]] and Avshalom Weinstein, who are both [[luthiers|violin makers]].

==Concerts and exhibitions==
In the first decade of the new millennium, Weinstein started to use the instruments of the Violins of Hope collection to initiate concerts combined with educational events teaching about the Holocaust.
