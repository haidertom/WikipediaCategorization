}}
'''Andrei Mocioni de Foen''' (also spelled '''Andrea de Mocioni''' or '''Andreiu Mocionĭ''', last name also '''Mocsonyi''', '''Mocsoni''', '''Mocionyi''' or '''Mocsony'''; {{lang-de|Andreas Mocioni de Foen}} or ''Andreas von Mocsonyi'', {{lang-hu|fényi Mocsonyi András}}; June 27, 1812 – April 23/May 5, 1880) was an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Hungarian]] jurist, politician, and informal leader of the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] community, one of the founding members of the [[Romanian Academy]]. Of a mixed [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] background, raised as a [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]], he belonged to the [[Mocioni family]], which had been elevated to [[Hungarian nobility]]. He was brought up at his family estate in the [[Banat]], at [[Foeni]], where he joined the administrative apparatus, and identified as a Romanian since at least the 1830s. He rose to prominence during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]: he was a supporter of the [[House of Lorraine]], trying to obtain increased autonomy for Banat Romanians in exchange for loyalism. The Austrians appointed Mocioni to an executive position over that region, but curbed his expectations by including the Banat as a whole into the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar|Voivodeship of Serbia]]. This disappointment pushed Mocioni to renounce politics during much of the 1850s.

The attempt by Austria to ensure a new administrative formula in the 1860s saw Mocioni's co-option into the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Diet]]. He also organized, in 1860, a National Assembly in the Banat, an abortive project seeking to obtain autonomy on ethnic grounds. He then oscillated between [[ethnic federalism]] within a nominal Hungarian realm and full centralism in Austria's custody, while failing in his bid to promote [[election boycott]] as a political weapon. He had noted political rivalries with Romanians who sided with [[Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary|Hungarian radicalism]], in particular [[Eftimie Murgu]]. Serving one full term in the [[Diet of Hungary]], Mocioni also turned to cooperation with the Romanians of [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], and helped [[Andrei Șaguna]] to reestablish an independent [[Metropolis of Transylvania|Transylvanian Metropolis]] for Romanian Orthodox Christians. Alongside his brothers [[Gheorghe Mocioni|Gheorghe]] and [[Anton Mocioni|Anton]], and his lawyer [[Vincențiu Babeș]], he founded the newspaper ''Albina'' of [[Vienna]].

The creation of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Banat's absorption into the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]] were significant blows for Mocioni's nationalist-loyalist campaign. Mocioni withdrew to Foeni, ailing and out of the public eye for the final decade of his life. He was still a noted philanthropist and sponsor of the Romanian press, but had conflicts with [[Krassó County]] voters and the Romanian peasants on his estates, a matter which contributed to his voluntary isolation. He was survived by his wife Laura, daughter of [[Petar Čarnojević]], and by his nephew, the politician [[Alexandru Mocioni]].

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
The Mocionis were probably descended from Petru Mucină, an Aromanian (or "Macedo-Romanian") priest from [[Aspropotamos, Trikala|Aspropotamos in Thessaly]] or [[Moscopole]], who declared loyalty to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and served in the [[Great Turkish War]].&lt;ref&gt;Colta, p. 66; Deheleanu, p. 216. See also Bugariu, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; He and one of his brothers were killed in action somewhere in the Banat.&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archpriest]] Constantin Mocioni, or "Constantinus Motsonyi", who may have been Mucină's son, settled among the Greek Orthodox (Greek, Romanian, and Aromanian) community of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 213–214; Colta, p. 66; Deheleanu, pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; Family documents suggest that he was originally from Moscopole, and that he died at 110 years of age; under his watch, the family established lucrative businesses and began purchasing estates in Hungary and the Banat.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 22–23, 112, 213–214; Deheleanu, pp. 216–217; Tiron, pp. 28–29, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; His two sons Andrei and Mihai were raised into the nobility by [[King of Hungary|King-Emperor]] [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]: the former in February 1783, the latter in June 1798, after distinguished service in the [[War of the First Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 214–215; Colta, pp. 66–67, 83; Deheleanu, p. 217; Tiron, pp. 31–35&lt;/ref&gt; The Mocionis were thus one of some 200 Aromanian families to receive titles, and became integrated with the 12,500 Romanian noble families attested in Hungary by 1800 (from a total 340,000).&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, pp. 29, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei the elder was killed in mysterious circumstances before he could receive his diploma, but this was granted to his wife.&lt;ref name="stbconac"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ștefan Both, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/foto-si-au-batut-joc-conacul-familiei-mocioni-foeni-fost-rand-baie-comunala-gradinita-depozit-sala-sport-discoteca-1_56250e6cf5eaafab2cd2b861/index.html "Cum și-au bătut joc de conacul familiei Mocioni de la Foeni. A fost pe rând baie comunală, grădiniță, depozit, sală de sport și discotecă"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' (Timișoara edition), October 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The more senior branch established by them became known as ''Mocioni de Foen'', or ''fényi Mocsonyi'', in reference to its core estate of [[Foeni|Foeni (Fény)]]. This was by contrast with Mihai's descendants, the ''armalist'' Mocionis, who did not hold a titular estate—although they built a manor at [[Birchiș|Birchiș (Marosberkes)]], they were mostly based in Pest, where they founded the Kefala Library.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 66–70&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei the second was a grandson of the original Andrei, born to lawyer Ioan Mocioni de Foen (1780–1854) and his wife Iuliana Panaiot (1787–1858).&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, pp. 28, 32&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, Andrei had [[Albanians|Albanian]] roots.&lt;ref name="thcapmaced"&gt;[[Theodor Capidan]], "Românii din Macedonia. Rolul Românilor Macedoneni în Ardeal. IV", in ''Cultura Poporului'', Nr. 30/1923, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mm72"&gt;[[Atanasie Marian Marienescu]], "Macedo-Românii din Ungaria", in [[V. A. Urechia]], ''Albumul Macedo-Român'', p. 72. Bucharest: [[Editura Socec|Socecŭ, Sander &amp; Teclu]], 1880.  {{OCLC|45239179}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, Petru, born in 1808, and two junior ones: [[Anton Mocioni|Anton]] and [[Gheorghe Mocioni|Gheorghe]] (born 1816 and 1823, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 219; Tiron, pp. 30, 31, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Other siblings included brothers George and Lucian (the latter of whom died young) and sister Ecaterina.&lt;ref name="thcapmaced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Ioan and Iuliana together had as many as 11 other children.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 184; Deheleanu, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei was simultaneously the uncle and cousin of writer [[Alexandru Mocioni]], born from a [[consanguine marriage]] between Ecaterina and her uncle Mihai Mocioni.&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 137; Colta, pp. 71–74; Deheleanu, p. 218; Tiron, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei the younger was a native of Pest, but grew up mostly in Foeni where, according to scholar [[Păun Otiman]], he received "a profoundly Christian Orthodox education, inspired by Macedo-Romanian traditions and culture".&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the Mocionis only spoke Aromanian and Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the family encouraged intercultural contacts, with Ioan speaking as many as eleven languages.&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt; According to the [[Serbs in Vojvodina|Banatian Serb]] journalist [[Mihailo Polit-Desančić]], the local Mocionis, including Andrei, also made a point of learning Serbian, and "sort of carried themselves like Serbs".&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2011), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by his contemporaries as a man of outstanding culture and upbringing, Andrei had "perfect" command of Aromanian, Romanian, Hungarian, Serbian, as well as Latin, French, and German.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, pp. 28–29. See also Bugariu, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, he took a law degree in 1828&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; or 1832, from the [[Eötvös Loránd University|Royal University of Pest]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 87; Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 219; Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked in the local administration of Banat. In 1836, he was the second-ranked [[notary]] of [[Torontál County]], being appointed first [[pretor]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 219; Tiron, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnologist Elena Rodica Colta dates the Mocionis' definitive self-identification as Romanians to this period, noting that they believed the entire Aromanian ethnos to be a branch of the Romanian community.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Pest, Andrei began frequenting the literary salon organized by [[Atanasiu Grabovski de Apadia]] in [[Terézváros]], meeting with exponents of Aromanian and Romanian causes.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 26–27, 118, 145, 189&lt;/ref&gt;

While participating in Torontál's ''congregatio generalis'', Andrei Mocioni sat with the "conservative-progressive" side of the Romanian caucus, taking his distance from the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary|revolutionary liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to his contribution, Torontál remained a safe seat for the conservative club of [[István Széchenyi]], committed to "moderate progress" for the country at large, with "national conservation" for the Romanians. In 1847, he managed to obtain a seat in the [[Diet of Hungary]], for his brother Petru, obtaining him votes from conservative Hungarians, Serbs, [[Banat Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], [[Armenians in Hungary|Armenians]] and [[Banat Swabians|Swabians]].&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 399"&gt;Bugariu, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

===1848 revolution and Banat leadership===
The same period saw him dragged into the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolutions]]. Like many Romanians, Mocioni supported the former's liberal reforms, and remained loyal to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]], opposing the rise of [[Hungarian nationalism]]. This pitted him against the pro-Hungarian revolutionary [[Eftimie Murgu]], who enlisted the loyalties of various other Banatians.&lt;ref name="Deheleanu, p. 220"&gt;Deheleanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hungarian State (1849)|Hungarian State]] reacted by confiscating Mocioni's property and forcing him into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 220; Tiron, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1849, he was in [[Vienna]], where he acted as a Romanian representative, alongside [[Ioan Dobran]] and [[Vincențiu Babeș]].&lt;ref&gt;Lițiu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Petru Mocioni was also active there as a "man of trust" of the Banatian Romanians,&lt;ref name="Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107"&gt;Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; presenting [[Franz Stadion, Count von Warthausen|Franz Stadion]] with a set of political proposals on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Ciorănescu, p. 218"&gt;Ciorănescu, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[surrender at Világos]] and the resumption of Austrian control, Mocioni's loyalty was rewarded, and he was appointed supreme commissioner for the Banat, within the new [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Ciorănescu, p. 218; Deheleanu, p. 220; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107; Tiron, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he governed directly over some 600,000 people.&lt;ref name="Ciorănescu, p. 218"/&gt; However, he disliked this arrangement, and, in December 1849, petitioned [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]] to obtain the secession of Banat as an autonomous, Romanian, province.&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 30"&gt;Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; During his mandate, the administration was staffed with a growing number of Romanians.&lt;ref name="Deheleanu, p. 220"/&gt; In tandem, his Mocioni relatives approached the Romanians of [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], also loyalists, and together with them began pressing for a Romanian dukedom to be created out of Romanian territories in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Ciorănescu, p. 44; Milin (2011), p. 398. See also Berényi, pp. 200–201; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner was also involved in such projects, proposing that a Romanian press be set up in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], located on the Banat's traditional border with Transylvania and [[Partium]].&lt;ref&gt;Lițiu, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, Mocioni was also campaigning to reestablish a [[Metropolis of Transylvania|Transylvanian (Romanian) Orthodox Metropolis]], fully separated from the [[Patriarchate of Karlovci]].&lt;ref name="thcapmaced"/&gt; The cause had first been embraced by Petru in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107"/&gt;

In 1852, he ultimately resigned as commissioner, expressing his protest toward the treatment of Romanians by the Austrian government.&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 220; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was asked to reconsider by the authorities, who feared that they were becoming unpopular with the majority population.&lt;ref name="Deheleanu, p. 220"/&gt; Although he did not resume his earlier posting, he went on to serve as president of the Central Commission in [[Timișoara|Temeschwar (Timișoara)]]; he was also a counsel for the [[Supreme Court (Austria)|Austrian Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, p. 30. See also Deheleanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned all positions in the state apparatus in 1856, and withdrew to Foeni. This decision was cemented in 1858 by the death of brother Petru, killed by his own landlord or doorman in Pest.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 219, 220, 221; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The killing, which some authors see as a political assassination,&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 399"/&gt; ended with a celebrity trial in which [[Emanoil Gojdu]] represented the Mocionis as plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, at Foeni, Mocioni married a Serb coreligionist, Laura, the Countess Csernovich (Čarnojević).&lt;ref name="ceenou211"&gt;"Ce e nou?", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 33/1880, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, pp. 219, 220; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; A woman of "outstanding beauty",&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2011), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; she was also noted for collecting Ancient Roman coins&lt;ref&gt;Babeșiu, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; and paintings with Roman subjects by Nicola Popescu.&lt;ref&gt;"Pesta in 12 Noemvre n.", in ''Albina'', Nr. 87/1866, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, ''[[Graf]]'' [[Petar Čarnojević]], had been an ally of the Hungarian revolutionaries; dispossessed and bankrupt, he moved to Foeni to live with the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2011), pp. 382–383&lt;/ref&gt; They also shared the manor with Alexandru and the other ''armalist'' Mocionis, who were similarly disappointed with Hungarian politics, and who progressively withdrew from Pest.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Atanasie Marian Marienescu]] notes that Mocioni, "everywhere encouraged and supported by the Romanian [[intelligentsia]], became in all places a leader of the Romanians in national and church causes, and this leadership was recognized by his brothers as well."&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt; From about 1860, he dedicated himself to the [[national awakening of Romania]]ns, networking between the Austrian subjects in the Banat, Transylvania, and the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], and those residing in the newly formed [[United Principalities]]. In November 1860, as [[Alexander von Mensdorff-Pouilly, Prince Dietrichstein von Nicolsburg|Count Mensdorff-Pouilly]] was sent over to report to Franz Joseph on the demands of Banat Romanians, Mocioni called in and organized a National Assembly. This demanded the creation of a Banat Captaincy, and, when the request was denied, an administrative incorporation with Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, pp. 399–400; Tiron, p. 30. See also Ciorănescu, pp. 89–90; Milin (2010), p. 21; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107; Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Romanians needed to form a singular "moral body", "called upon as a nation to partake in Austria's constitutional life."&lt;ref&gt;Ciorănescu, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Memorandum to the Throne'', Mocioni also theorized that the Banat was an "individuality" distinct from the Serbian and Hungarian regions, and suggested that "never-ending problems" would result from its continued amalgamation.&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2010), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Diet and church separation===

On May 31, 1860,&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Mocioni was co-opted by the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Diet]], which contemplated administrative reforms based on new ethnic arrangements. He was an "extraordinary counsel", alongside [[Andrei Șaguna]] of Transylvania and [[Nicolae de Petrino]] of Bukovina, supporting regional autonomy and the reestablishment and a Romanian Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', pp. 222, 327; Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 220–221; Lupaș, pp. 187–189; Otiman, p. 28; Păcățian, ''passim''; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; By origin, all three were in fact Aromanians.&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, both Șaguna and Mocioni objected to Diet being non-democratic, and, on this point, agreed with [[György Apponyi]] that the delegates only represented themselves. Their objection was registered, but they were asked by [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Rainer]] not to insist on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt; Seen from his regional constituency, Mocioni was also one of two representatives of the Voivodeship, including the Banat. The other was a Serb prelate, [[Samuilo Maširević]].&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, pp. 268–269, 270&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1860, Mocioni clarified that he considered himself a legitimate Banat and "people's" representative.&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, Mocioni was elected to the Budget Committee, and from this position campaigned to have Romanian Orthodox churches subsidized on par with other state-recognized religions.&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, pp. 270, 274, 278–279&lt;/ref&gt; Proclaiming the equality of nations against demands for Hungarian hegemony, he found himself debating the issue with [[György Majláth (1786–1861)|György Majláth]], who accused him of fostering the rebellious doctrines of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. Mocioni defended his ideas as mainstream, arguing that equality had been promised by Franz Joseph himself.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Malfèr, "Les représentations de Garibaldi en Autriche", in Jean-Yves Frétigné, Paul Pasteur (eds.), ''Changer d'époque, n° 23. Garibaldi: modèle, contre-modèle'', p. 114. Rouen: Publications des universités de Rouen et du Havre, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-2-87775-508-5}}. See also Ciorănescu, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Mocioni sided with the "centralists", who supported [[proportional representation]] within a centralized Austria; Petrino, a "federalist", wanted regional decentralization on the basis of old laws, which, while favoring Bukovinans, would have left Romanians in Hungary underrepresented as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Lupaș, p. 189; Păcățian, pp. 277–279&lt;/ref&gt; The two made common cause in their opposition to a projected union between Bukovina and [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]].&lt;ref name="Păcățian, p. 275"&gt;Păcățian, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocioni's mandate ended with the Diet recall on September 29, 1860.&lt;ref name="Păcățian, p. 275"/&gt; He had failed in his bid to secure Banat autonomy: the region, alongside all of the Voivodeship, was re-annexed to the Hungarian crown in December 1860. In April 1861, Mocioni persuaded the Banat Romanians to boycott future elections for the reestablished Hungarian Diet. This decision was overturned later that year, when a new ethnic assembly passed a resolution calling for single Romanian candidatures, supported by all voters.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"&gt;Bugariu, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Mocioni himself was elected for [[Krassó County|Krassó (Caraș) County]], at [[Lugoj|Lugoj (Lugos)]]. His rival was Murgu, who sided with the [[Address Party]] and supported incorporation with Hungary. Mocioni, perceived as the Romanian nationalist candidate, won 621 votes to 94.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 102–103. See also Wlad, pp. 39–42&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had not agreed to be listed as a candidate,&lt;ref&gt;Wlad, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately renounced his seat.&lt;ref&gt;Ovidiu Emil Iudean, Alexandru Onojescu, "Politics, Nationalism, and Parliamentarianism: Romanian Representatives in the Budapest Parliament (1861–1918)", in ''Transylvanian Review'', Vol. XXII, Issue 4, Winter 2013, p. 6; Papio Ilariano, pp. 4–5, 68&lt;/ref&gt; In his address, Mocioni explained that "he had nothing in common with the Hungarian diet of Pest, since he had never intended to become a Hungarian."&lt;ref&gt;Papio Ilariano, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a publicized row with the Temeschwar [[Burgrave]], the pro-Hungarian [[Petru Cermena]], but their dispute was ultimately patched up by Babeș.&lt;ref&gt;Babeșiu, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet itself was dissolved later that year.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"/&gt;

Mocioni's solution to these setbacks was the attempted creation of a de facto "political body" and "[[crown land]]" for all Romanians of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"/&gt; In the parallel debate over church affairs, Șaguna, the designated Metropolitan, had Mocioni as one of his "most ardent supporters",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; one "fighting like a virile lion for the hierarchic separation".&lt;ref name="paroh"&gt;"Epistolele parochului betranu, XIV", in ''Biseric'a si Scóla'', Nr. 51/1887, pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Mediating between the Karlovci Patriarch [[Josif Rajačić]] and his Romanian clergy, he proposed to convene a representative [[synod]] on the issue of separation, knowing that it would favor the Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', p. 229; Hitchins, p. 13; Lupaș, pp. 193, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriarch resisted this move and suspended the negotiations, arguing that "the [Serb] nation would have me stoned to death".&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', p. 229; Lupaș, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Rajačić's death in late 1861 created confusion among the Serb bishops, empowering Mocioni to network and campaign for the national schism.&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 366–367; Hitchins, pp. 14–16; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined his political manifesto for autonomy in articles for ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' of [[Brașov|Corona]], as well as in reports addressed to Franz Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, p. 28; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; That year, with Șaguna and [[Alexandru Sterca-Șuluțiu]], Mocioni established [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]], which promoted Romanian identity and culture, created despite continued chicanery from Hungarian officials.&lt;ref&gt;"Buletinul ''Astrei'' Satu-Mare. ''Astra'' la Abrud", in ''Afirmarea'', Nr. 9/1938, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He also placed a bid for ASTRA's presidency, but lost to Șaguna.&lt;ref&gt;Lupaș, p. 748&lt;/ref&gt;

He was more successful in his campaigning for an Orthodox metropolis, set up in December 1864; from 1865, it incorporated Banatian Romanian churches as the [[Diocese of Caransebeș]].&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 366–367; Tiron, pp. 30–31. See also Bugariu, p. 400; Hitchins, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1862, Mocioni, Șaguna, and [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi]] had managed to obtain Franz Joseph's sympathy on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', pp. 327–328; Hitchins, pp. 16–17; Lupaș, pp. 271–272, 278; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about this victory in ''[[Telegraful Român]]'' of Transylvania and ''Concordia'' of Bukovina, persuading "right-believing Romanians" not to participate in the election of a Rajačić replacement.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', p. 328; Bocșan (2011), p. 366; Lupaș, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Mocioni was disappointed with Șaguna, who did not back his plan for creating a new [[Archdiocese of Timișoara|bishopric at Temeschwar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 366–368; P. Ionescu, "Observări la rĕspunsul Prea Cuv. Sale Dlui arhimandrit Dr. Ilarion Pușcariu", in ''Foaia Diecesană'', Nr. 28/1901, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During this clash, he withdrew his financial support for the church historian [[Nicolae Tincu-Velea]], who had to print his works with ASTRA.&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 367–368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian Diet===
Returning to Arad, Mocioni helped establish there a National Culture and Enlightenment Association, presided upon by [[Prokopije Ivačković]] and Anton Mocioni. It received his collection of historical documents, and appointed him a delegate to Vienna, to thank the emperor for supporting Romanian culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Ungari'a. Prim'a adunare generala a Associatiunei natiunale in Aradu, pentru cultur'a si conversarea poporului romanu (Continuare lá Nr. 39)", in ''[[Telegraful Român]]'', Nr. 40/1863, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, his philanthropy expanded. He donated his only source of income, the revenue of Foeni, to the famine-stricken population of that village, and even ran into debt in his effort to provide for them.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 400; Deheleanu, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interested in [[horse breeding]], and one of his steeds became the ancestor of an equine string that populated much of Foeni.&lt;ref name="wrangel"&gt;C. G. Wrangel, ''Ungarns Pferdezucht in Wort und Bild. Vierter Band: Die ungarische Landespferdezucht; Die Privatgestüte. Zweiter Teil'', pp. 22–23. Stuttgart: Verlag von Schickhardt &amp; Ebner, 1895.  {{OCLC|312705921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, the Romanians of Banat continued to plead with the emperor for Romanian self-rule in the Banat. One such petition, circulated in December 1863, also asked Franz Joseph to surround himself with Romanian advisers, including "Andrea de Mocioni, lord of Foeni", a man distinguished by "political, patriotic, and national virtues".&lt;ref&gt;"Plansórea Romaniloru Banatiani (incheiere din Nrulu trecutu)", in ''[[Foaia pentru Minte, Inimă și Literatură|Foaia pentru Minte, Anima si Literatura]]'', Nr. 29/1863, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by historian Tudor-Radu Tiron, the restoration of Hungarian rule ultimately pushed the Mocionis back into Hungarian politics, which explains why Andrei, Anton and Gheorghe all took seats in the last Diet of Hungary (1865).&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 31"&gt;Tiron, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru also won a [[Tormac|Rittberg]] seat in that legislature, becoming known as the theoretician of [[national liberalism]], and main proponent of a Nationalities Bill, which aimed at validating autonomous units for the Romanians in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 215–220; Nicolae Bocșan, "Liberalism and Nationalism in Alexandru Mocsonyi's Parliamentary Activity (1865–1871)", in ''Transylvanian Review'', Vol. XXII, Issue 4, Winter 2013, pp. 17–24; Ciorănescu, p. 92; Deheleanu, pp. 222–223; Milin (2010), pp. 21–28&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, the Mocionis' contribution to the national cause was being recognized in the United Principalities, customarily known as the "[[Principality of Romania]]". From January 1865, he was an honorary member of the nationalist ''Bucovina'' Society.&lt;ref&gt;D. Murărașu, "Comentarii eminesciene 1866–1874. ''La mormântul lui Aron Pumnul''", in [[Mihai Eminescu]], ''Opere I. Poezii (I)'', p. 269. Bucharest: Grai și Suflet – Cultura Națională, 1995.  {{ISBN|973-9232-07-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1866, the Romanian Regency appointed Andrei Mocioni a founding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] (or "Romanian Literary Society", as it was known at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 400; Otiman, ''passim''; Tiron, pp. 28, 31&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted as a Banat representative, alongside Babeș—who, in 1883, wrote Mocioni's biography.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, ''passim''; Tiron, p. 31. See also Bugariu, p. 400; Lupaș, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; From 1861, the Mocionis and Babeș had cooperated in countering Hungarian nationalist propaganda abroad, publicizing the Romanian point of view. According to Babeș, their effort was sabotaged by [[Abdolonyme Ubicini]], [[István Türr]], and [[Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla]], who wanted a Hungarian–Romanian alliance against Austria; but also found backing from [[László Teleki]] of the [[Resolution Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Babeșiu, pp. 174–176&lt;/ref&gt; With his parallel career as a lawyer, Babeș also helped the Mocionis win back 5 million [[Hungarian forint|forint]] from their Hungarian debtors, and was thereafter their trusted adviser.&lt;ref&gt;Cosma, pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1866, echoes of Mocioni's "Captaincy" project were discernible in the radical proposal advanced in the Diet by Babeș, [[Sigismund Popoviciu]], and [[Iosif Hodoșiu]]: it recognized subjection to the Hungarian crown and government, but sought to redefine Hungary on the basis of [[ethnic federalism]] and [[corporatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2010), p. 23. See also Neș, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts also failed. By September 1866, Mocioni and Babeș began speaking out in the Diet about the wish of Austrian Romanians to be united with the Principality of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Liviu Damean, "Români și maghiari în contextul războiului austro–prusian (1866)", in ''Analele Universității din Craiova, Seria Istorie'', Vol. XVI, Issue 1, 2011, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1866–1867 interval was a great disappointment for the various schools of Romanian nationalism: the return of Hungarian nationalism was unopposed following the [[Austro-Prussian War]], and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'' of 1867]] created [[Austria-Hungary]], including most Romanian-inhabited areas into the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]. Mocioni was especially affected by the outcome.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31"&gt;Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the months following the new arrangement, Mocioni and Babeș participated in the drafting of another protest, also signed by the Diet's Serb, Slovak and "[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]" deputies. The resolution, which demanded guarantees for the minorities, was supposed to be read by Mocioni. He stepped down to make way for a more popular deputy, the Serb [[Milán Manojlovics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Manifestatiune colective in cestiunea de nationalitate", in ''[[Românul|Romanulu]]'', December 22, 1867, p. 1096&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Anton Mocioni, alongside Serbs [[Stevan Branovački]] and [[Svetozar Miletić]], continued to back the campaign, proposing to divide Hungary into six ethnic-based provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, pp. 15, 114–116, 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final withdrawal===
In 1869, Andrei Mocioni withdrew from all activism and returned to Foeni.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31"/&gt; That year, an analysis in ''Der Wanderer'' newspaper noted that "although Andrea Mocioni will forever remain the true leader" of the Romanian caucus, Alexandru was emerging as the tactician, and moderating the Romanians' resistance to Hungarian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Varietati. Indreptare", in ''Albina'', Nr. 10/1869, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the various factions seeking to form a [[Romanian National Party]] had only managed to establish a Transylvanian caucus and a Banatian one. The latter, presided upon by Anton Mocioni, recognized Hungarian rule and sought to obtain Romanian rights within its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; An 1872 report to his partisans also claimed that Andrei and the other Mocionis were "disgusted" and "demoralized" by the behavior of Romanian electors in Lugoj and Krassó, who acted as "proselytes of the [Hungarian] government".&lt;ref&gt;"Lugosiu, 4 fauru 1872", in ''Albina'', Nr. 9/1872, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocioni also continued to be active as a sponsor and philanthropist, providing funds for Babeș's ethnological work, and for the Viennese Romanian newspaper, ''Albina''.&lt;ref&gt;Cosma, pp. 263–268; Deheleanu, pp. 221–222; Munteanu, p. 64; Neș, p. 298; Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brothers published and wrote for the latter sheet, alongside Babeș,&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 202–204; Cosma, pp. 264–266&lt;/ref&gt; while also financing pro-Romanian campaigns in the German-language journal ''Ost und West''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Visarion Roman]] and [[Partenie Cosma]], they established in 1871 the Albina Bank of [[Sibiu]], providing credit for Romanian businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Mocioni also provided funds in hopes of creating a Romanian regional theater, and became [[Godparent|godfather]] of Andrei, the child of actors [[Mihail Pascaly|Mihail]] and [[Matilda Pascaly]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 56, 162. See also Neș, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The family as a whole provided a scholarship fund for disadvantaged children, managed by Babeș.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 210, 220–221, 237; Bugariu, p. 400; Deheleanu, p. 221; Neș, pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; Noted recipients include writer [[Gruia Liuba Murgu]],&lt;ref&gt;Cosma, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; biologist [[Victor Babeș]], and lawyer [[Coriolan Brediceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The former deputy and the [[Magyar Posta|Hungarian post]] had an unsolved dispute about the creation of a Foeni post office, which the officials viewed as too costly. Mocioni took the [[postmaster]] examination and, at his own expense, erected a building which, with its [[mahogany]] furniture and silver [[inkwell]]s, was recognized as "the most elegant post office".&lt;ref name="biroulu"&gt;"Diverse. Biroulu postalu celu mai elegantu", in ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania|Gazet'a Transilvaniei]]'', Nr. 54/1880, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocioni was still pressed by his friends to make a return to politics. He refused on principle, but allowed for a theoretical possibility: "I shall no longer fight and sacrifice myself to the four winds, but will patiently wait for a national regeneration to begin, if ever."&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"/&gt; A local tradition, recorded in 1905 by the newspaper ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', noted that, by then, he and his Serb wife were detested by the local Romanians, who once attacked the manor and shattered its windows.&lt;ref name="concert"&gt;"Concertul de la Foenĭ", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 37/1905, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to a notice in the Arad Orthodox paper ''Biseric'a si Scóla'', Mocioni was also driven away from religious affairs after "a mean gossiper libeled him, out of the blue and without a shred of truthfulness".&lt;ref name="paroh"/&gt;

Mocioni's health was failing, and for this reason he never attended any session of the Romanian Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; From 1879, Mocioni's disease worsened, and, once bedridden, he was taken to Temeschwar to be under specialist care.&lt;ref name="ceenou211"/&gt; Mocioni died on May 5 (April 23), 1880. Although some sources give his death place as Foeni,&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 31"/&gt; contemporary reports have it that he died in Temeschwar, after having lapsed into a brief coma, and while looked after by his wife Laura.&lt;ref name="ceenou211"/&gt; Their marriage had produced no heirs.&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 30"/&gt;

===Legacy===
[[File:Cripta familiei Mocioni din Foeni.jpg|thumb|380px|Mocioni crypt in Foeni, 2015 photograph]]
Mocioni's body was taken to Foeni for an Orthodox burial at the common Serb–Romanian church, which he and his wife had furnished.&lt;ref name="intoler"&gt;"Noutăți. Intoleranță", in ''Tribuna Poporului'', Nr. 110/1900, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Laura inherited all his wealth, which sparked a Mocioni family feud.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt; Already a licensed postal worker, she continued Mocioni's work as a postmaster.&lt;ref name="biroulu"/&gt; She died on the estate in August 1892, aged 53,&lt;ref&gt;"Ce e nou? Necrolog", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 32/1892, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at his side.&lt;ref name="intoler"/&gt; In her late years, she had carried on with Mocioni philanthropy work, but only servicing the local Serb community and punishing Romanian ingratitude. According to ''Tribuna'', the "new generation" of Romanians, "more enlightened than the earlier one", was expressing shame and regret for having alienated her.&lt;ref name="concert"/&gt; By then, a scandal had erupted over Mocioni's remains. The church remained a property of the Karlovci Patriarchy, which in 1900 refused to hand over the body for reburial in the Mocioni mausoleum. It cited texts which condemned the separation in death of husband and wife, but the Romanian press suspected that such resistance was proof of "intolerant" [[Serb nationalism]].&lt;ref name="intoler"/&gt; A separation was eventually made, and Andrei was reburied in the new location.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt;

The various Mocioni estates went to brothers Alexandru and Eugen. Some were inherited by Eugen's sons, before passing to Ecaterina Mocioni and her husband, Jenő, [[Teleki family|Count Teleki]]; others went to the Bukovinan baron [[Ioan Mocsony-Stârcea]], who was Alexandru's adoptive son.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; The core manor at Foeni was nevertheless inherited by the [[Csávossy]] counts,&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="concert"/&gt; while his horses continued to be bred by the Austrians Jakob Haas and Ludwig Deutsch.&lt;ref name="wrangel"/&gt; The property was pillaged by peasants during the [[Aster Revolution|revolutionary events]] which marked the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918. According to one Romanian account, this incident provided the [[Hungarian Royal Gendarmerie]] with an excuse to murder Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Bocșan, "The Banatian Revolution from the Autumn of 1918 in the Collective Memory {{sic}}", in ''Transylvanian Review'', Vol. XXIV, Issue 4, Winter 2015, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Most other assets were kept by the surviving family following the establishment of [[Greater Romania]], when Anton Jr bought back the Foeni mansion, hoping to turn it into a cultural club.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt; According to historian Vicențiu Bugariu, by 1930 Andrei Mocioni was already forgotten, a victim of "ignorance and indifference".&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 399"/&gt; This trend was censured by the Banat politician [[Sever Bocu]]. Although a critic of "Mocionist" conservatism in Austria-Hungary, during the interwar he became noted for his work to preserve and shed light on the family's contribution as a "moral dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, pp. 8, 20, 47, 51–52, 58, 64–65, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Bocu wrote Andrei Mocioni's profile as a study in national pedagogy,&lt;ref&gt;Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that any Banatian unaware of the Mocionis' role "is a Banatian in name only".&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Mocioni, or any other of his relatives, is also mentioned in the [[Banat Romanian dialect|dialectical Banatian]] poetry of the interwar.

With the death of Anton Jr in 1943, the direct Mocioni lineage was extinguished; however, interest in the family was still kept alive by Bocu's nephew, the scholar Ion D. Suciu.&lt;ref&gt;Mureșan &amp; Suciu, pp. 89–90, 92–94, 106&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the estates were subject to [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]] under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], which turned the Foeni complex into a public bathhouse, and then into a storage room for chemicals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2671">'''Average Per-Bit Delivery Cost''', or APBDC, is one relatively common method by which [[Internet Service Providers]] calculate their [[cost of goods sold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.net/resources/tutorials/average-per-bit-delivery-cost/APBDC-Tutorial-v09.txt Average Per-Bit Delivery Costs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204165444/http://www.pch.net/resources/tutorials/average-per-bit-delivery-cost/APBDC-Tutorial-v09.txt |date=February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Concept ==
Average Per-Bit Delivery Cost averages the cost of however many bits were actually sent or received across a link with the actual cost of operation of the link.  This is contrasted principally with flat-rate and 95th percentile functions, which are typically used for billing rather than cost-accounting. In typical use, APBDCs of individual links or components of an operating network are compared with the APBDC of the whole, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the components, and to track improvements in effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgp4.as/internet-exchanges IXPs reduce the portion of an ISP's traffic which must be delivered via their upstream transit providers, thereby reducing the Average Per-Bit Delivery Cost of their service.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829211554/http://www.bgp4.as/internet-exchanges |date=August 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

High APBDC may reflect either a high cost, or a low utilization, either of which is detrimental to the price-performance of the network as a whole, and indicates an area that needs attention and improvement. Besides reduction in costs of existing network components, use of already-amortized or less expensive components, and transmission of greater volumes of traffic, fundamental or "revolutionary" changes to the topology of a network, such as the substitution of peering-derived bandwidth for purchased transit, often have substantial impacts on a network's APBDC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connectedcaribbean.com/download/CTU%20Bulletin%20On%20Proliferation%20of%20Caribbean%20Internet%20Exchange%20Points.pdf CTU Bulletin on the Proliferation of Internet Exchange Points in the Caribbean]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Badruddin Ahmad''' (17 August 1912, Patiala, India - 19 March 1981, Karachi, Pakistan) was a pioneer in the field of [[Civil aviation]]. He was instrumental in the development of post-[[Second World War|World War II]] aviation plans and supervised the construction of non-military runways and airports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manimasood.com/civil-aviation-pioneer/&lt;/ref&gt; The assets developed by Ahmad were transferred to the international civil authorities, leading to the advent of Civil Aviation as an industry.

Ahmad was perhaps best known for his association with the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and in his roles as the Director General of Civil Aviation for the [[Government of Pakistan]] and Chief of Administration at the [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]].

==Education==

Ahmad graduated with a Master of Arts in Mathematics degree, with specialization in Advanced Astronomy from [[Allahabad University]] (then called 'University of Allahbad' and referred to as 'the Oxford of the East')&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1106781.cms Allahabad Varsity to become a central university] [[The Times of India]], May 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; on 30 January 1935.

==Career==

Badruddin Ahmed was instrumental in the events and planning that lead to the advent of the Civil Aviation industry.

He drafted government policy on the [[subsidization]] of flying clubs; licensed many non-military pilots, navigators and ground engineers; and progressed the selection and training of pilots and ground engineers for the [[Royal Indian Air Force]].

After [[Pakistan Movement|partition of Indian subcontinent]], Ahmed drafted the plans for Civil Aviation in Pakistan and conducted pioneer work in establishing the Department of Civil Aviation in Pakistan and was responsible for the coordination of the department's activities and international relations.

He was responsible for much work in the establishment of [[Pakistan International Airlines]] and was director in charge of the construction of various civil aviation works such as jet [[runways]] and [[airports]].

In 1955 he was elected member of the British [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport|Institute of Transport]]. He was elected Chairman in 1959 by unanimous vote of the Joint Middle East and South East Asia Air Navigation Conference to lay down the rules for [[Jet Aircraft]] operations.

In 1959, he was awarded the [[Tamgha-e-Quaid-e-Azam]], a prestigious [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|civil decoration of Pakistan]], for his contribution to the Civil Aviation development in Pakistan.

In 1960 he was promoted to Director General of Civil Aviation Authority.

In 1962 he was given the additional appointment of Chief of Administration with the status of Additional Director in the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

During his career he represented Pakistan in four General Assemblies of the International Civil Aviation Organization and worked on defining international travel and carrier routes.

==Horticulture==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Badruddin Ahmad with Begum Liaqat Ali.jpg|right|thumb|Badruddin Ahmad at a flower show, receiving an award from [[Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan|Begum Liaquat Ali]], First Lady of Pakistan.]] --&gt;

In addition to his distinguished career in government policy and Civil Aviation, Ahmad made contributions to the field of [[horticulture]].

He was a fellow of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] and the Royal Rose Society (now the [[Royal National Rose Society]]). Many [[Introduced species|non-indigenous plants]] in the Indian Subcontinent are attributed to him.

He was co-founder of the Horticultural Society of Pakistan and served as its Vice President from 1959 to 1961. During his tenure he introduced the [[Ficus elastica|rubber plant]] (''Ficus elastica'') to Pakistan and received awards and recognition for [[Crotons]] and [[Carnation]] cultivations.

After death, the [[British High Commission]] suggested that the Government of Pakistan dedicate a [[Botanical and horticultural library|Horticultural Library]] to his name. A one million-pound memorial fund for books was offered. Alas, political turbulence in Pakistan at the time meant that the proposal never came to fruition.

==Personal life==

Ahmad was born in  Patiala, India to Khairuddin Ahmad and Fatima Begum Javed. His father was a Royal Veterinary Surgeon and his mother was a homemaker. He is the oldest of five siblings, three sisters and two younger brothers.

A [[polyglot]], Ahmad was able to speak, read and write in [[English language|English]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; and had working knowledge of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other languages.

He participated in the popular ''Brain Trust'' programme on [[Radio Pakistan]], was a member of the [[Royal Photographic Society]], and a lifetime member of the council of the [[Iqbal Academy Pakistan|Iqbal Academy]].

He was married twice to Ms. Jeanne Ahmed and Ms. Maher UnNisah and had two sons, Saeed A Masood and Shafat A Mehmood.

'''Benfruit Plant'''  is a fruit-processing plant based in [[Benue State]] in Nigeria’s fertile middle-belt region. It is owned and operated by [[Teragro Commodities Limited]], the agribusiness subsidiary of [[Transnational Corporation of Nigeria]] Plc (Transcorp), a Lagos-based conglomerate. It was established in 2011 as a result of a partnership between Teragro and the Benue State Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/04/there-are-huge-potentials-for-fruit-processing-in-benue-transcorp-ceo/|title=There are huge potentials for fruit processing in Benue - Transcorp CEO  - Vanguard News|date=2012-04-19|work=Vanguard News|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant is used to process orange and pineapple concentrates, mango purees and orange oil for industrial markets. The plant can process up to 26.5 million tons of fruit per year; the existing technology housed there ensures that the juices extracted meet international quality standards.

== History ==

On May 19, 2011, Teragro signed an agreement with the Benue State government to take over Benfruit, the state-run fruit juice concentrate company.

The plant, which is located in the Makurdi Industrial Estate, is situated on one hectare of land. It has installed capacity to produce orange, mango and pineapple fruit concentrates at up to 26,500 metric tonnes per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoctopusnews.com/tag/teragro-benfruit-plant-in-benue-state/|title=Teragro Benfruit Plant in Benue State – The Octopus News|website=www.theoctopusnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During several consultations across the state with farmers’ cooperatives, government representatives, and local politicians, Transcorp Plc was invited to make the investment in support of Benue’s reputation as the ‘food basket of the nation'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/business/16761-hope-rises-for-benue-farmers-as-nepc-plans-citrus-export&lt;/ref&gt; Benue State currently produces over one million (1,000,000) metric tonnes of citrus fruits per annum.

The Benfruit transaction was Transcorp’s first investment in the agribusiness segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/juiced-up-creating-markets-to-drive-agriculture/114745/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128143151/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/juiced-up-creating-markets-to-drive-agriculture/114745 |archivedate=2012-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Break-even''' (or '''break even'''), often abbreviated as '''B/E''' in finance, is the point of balance making ''neither'' a profit nor a loss. The term originates in finance, but the concept has been applied widely since. 

==In economics==
{{Main|Break-even (economics)}}
In [[economics]] and [[business]], specifically [[cost accounting]], the '''break-even point''' ('''BEP''') is the point at which cost or expenses and revenue are equal: there is no net loss or gain, and one has "broken even." A profit or a loss has not been made, although [[opportunity cost]]s have been "paid" and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return. In other words, it´s the point in which the total revenue of a business exceed its total costs, and the business begins to create wealth instead of consuming it.&lt;ref name='R000000'&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine | first = David | authorlink = David K. Levine |author2=Michele Boldrin | title = ''Against Intellectual Monopoly'' | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2008-09-07 | location = | pages = 312 | url = http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-521-87928-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown graphically as the point where the total revenue and total cost curves meet. In the linear case the break-even point is equal to the fixed costs divided by the [[contribution margin]] per unit.

The break-even point is achieved when the generated profits match the total costs accumulated until the date of profit generation. Establishing the break-even point helps businesses in setting plans for the levels of production which it needs to maintain be profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Breakeven point|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/business/finance/profitabilityrev1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In finance==
The accounting method of calculating '''break-even point''' does not include cost of [[working capital]]. The [[financial]] method of calculating break-even, called '''value added break-even analysis''', is used to assess the feasibility of a project. This method not only accounts for all costs, it also includes the [[opportunity cost]]s of the [[Financial capital|capital]] required to develop a project.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A. Brealey|Brealey, R.]], [[Stewart Myers|Myers, S.]], Marcus, A., Maynes, E., Mitra, D. 2009. Fundamentals of Corporate Finance. McGraw-Hill Ryerson. USA. pp. 284. {{ISBN|978-0-07-098403-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other fields==
In [[nuclear fusion]] research, the term "break-even" refers to a [[fusion energy gain factor]] equal to unity; this is also known as the [[Lawson criterion]].  The notion can also be found in more general phenomena, such as [[percolation]]. In energy, the break-even point is the point where usable energy gotten from a process equals the input energy.

In [[computer science]], the term (used infrequently) refers to a point in the life cycle of a [[programming language]] where the language can be used to code its own [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. This is also called [[self-hosting]].

In [[medicine]], it is a postulated state when the advances of medicine permit every year an increase of one year or more of the life expectancy ''of the living'', therefore leading to medical immortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; barring accidental death.

In [[soccer]], the break-even requirement was adopted by [[UEFA]] with the purpose of prohibiting clubs from spending more money on transfers than they actually earn as businesses, i.e. revenue per each fiscal year excluding donations from sponsors or advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/02/56/20/15/2562015_DOWNLOAD.pdf Page 38 (44 in PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centralisation''' (British) or '''centralization''' (both British and American) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular geographical location  group. This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.

The term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In [[political science]], centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a [[centralized government]].

==Centralisation in politics==

===History of the centralisation of authority===
''Centralisation of authority'' is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, A. (2012). ''What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralization of authority ?.'' [online] Preservearticles.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/201101143291/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-centralisation-of-authority.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was first introduced in the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancientmilitary.com, (2012). ''Ancient China Government.'' [online] Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ancientmilitary.com/ancient-china-government.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that [[Han Fei]]zi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, D., Bickers, R., Carter, J., de Weert, H., Elders, C., Entenmann, R. and Felton, M. (2007). ''World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia. New York: Marshall Cavendish'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation of authority in ancient Chinese government===
* The monarchical power is the supreme power in the empire. The emperor monopolizes all the resources in the country; his personality and abilities decide the prosperity of the country. This autocratic system allows for faster decision-making and avoids complex solutions to problems that arise. One disadvantage is that courtiers, who compete for the emperor's favor, are able to amass power for themselves, leading to internal strife.(Jin and Liu, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Jin, G. and Liu, Q. (1992). ''The Cycle of Growth and Decline - On the Ultrastable Structure of Chinese Society: Chapter 7''. 2nd ed. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The administrative department has highly centralized power. The duties of each bureaucratic occupation are not clearly defined, leading to inefficiencies as functionaries manage the government and effectively rule the country.

===Idea of centralisation of authority===
The acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.

The centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the centralisation of authority===
Centralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:

# Responsibilities and duties are well defined within the central governing body.
# Decision-making is very direct and clear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Singh, K. (2015). ''What is Centralization and De-Centralization of the Authority? | Total MBA Guide.'' [online] Mbaofficial.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mbaofficial.com/mba-courses/principles-of-management/what-is-centralization-and-de-centralization-of-the-authority/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The central power maintains a large "encompassing interest" in the welfare of the state it rules since it stands to benefit from any increase in the state's wealth and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the incentives of state and ruler are aligned.

Disadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:

# Decisions may be misunderstood while being passed on and lower position departments do not have the decision-making power, therefore it requires an efficient and well-organized top department.
# Attention and support for each department or city may not be balanced.
# Delay of work information may result in inefficiency of the government.
# Discrepancies in the economy and information resources between the centre and other places are significant.&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, G. (2010). ''藤井厳喜WEBサイト | Fujii's Focus For Future 公式ブログ.'' [online] Gemki-fujii.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.gemki-fujii.com/blog/2010/000641.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Excludes actors at the local and provincial levels from the prevailing system of governance, reducing the capacity of the central government to resolve disputes or design effective policies requiring local knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawyer|first=Amos|date=2004-09-01|title=Violent conflicts and governance challenges in West Africa: the case of the Mano River basin area|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/violent-conflicts-and-governance-challenges-in-west-africa-the-case-of-the-mano-river-basin-area/05EB21C20F63C87E8E9319952E5A6455|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=42|issue=3|pages=437–463|doi=10.1017/S0022278X04000266|issn=1469-7777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in economy==
===Relationship between centralisation (i.e. concentration of production) and capitalism===
{{Main|Capitalism#Concentration and centralisation|Capital accumulation#Concentration and centralization}}
As written in V.I. Lenin’s book, ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', "The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lenin, V. (1939). ''Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism.'' New York: International Publishers,  pp.12-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Cartel - In economics, a cartel is an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market. It is a formal organisation of sellers or buyers that agree to fix selling prices, purchase prices, or reduce production using a variety of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. and Sheffrin, S. (2003). ''Economics.'' Needham, Mass.: Prentice Hall, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Syndicate - A syndicate is a self-organising group made up of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.
*Trust - "A trust is . . . simply the case of one person holding the title of property, whether land or chattels, for the benefit of another, termed a beneficiary. Nothing can be more common or more useful. But the word is now loosely applied to a certain class, of commercial agreements and, by reason of a popular and unreasoning dread of their effect, the term itself has become contaminated."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore, D. (1888). "The Legality of "Trusts". ''Political Science Quarterly'', 3(592).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in business studies==
Most businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).

The choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. (2014). ''Centralised versus decentralised structures | Business | tutor2u.'' [online] Beta.tutor2u.net. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://beta.tutor2u.net/business/reference/centralised-versus-decentralised-structures&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation in management===
# Top level managers concentrate and reserve the decision-making power.
# Execution decided by the top level management with the help from the other levels of management.
# Lower levels management do the jobs which directed and controlled by the top managers.'''(BMS Team, 2013)'''&lt;ref&gt;BMS Team, (2013). ''Important Features of centralization | BMS.co.in.'' [online] BMS.co.in : Bachelor of Management Studies. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.bms.co.in/important-features-of-centralization/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citywest''' ({{lang-ga|Iarthar na Cathrach}}) is a business campus on the southwestern periphery of [[Dublin]], with some residential and retail provision.  Mainly developed by Davy Hickey Properties, it also contains a hotel and golf course.

==Amenities==
Citywest began as, and is centred on, a business campus, with a hotel and conference centre, golf facility, shopping area, and in recent years, also residential areas &lt;ref name="Receiver"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0710/1224274418707.html |title=Mansfield will accept appointment of receiver to Citywest complex |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |first=Ciarán |last=Hnadcock |date=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; north and northwest of [[Saggart]]&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.citywesthotel.com/contact-us/getting-here Citywest Hotel official site - Location page - address and map]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  The nearest suburban centre is [[Tallaght]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Parish of Tallaght, Co. Dublin|url=https://www.townlands.ie/dublin/tallaght/|website=townlands.ie|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The [[River Camac]] passes north of the business campus, and two of its tributaries pass through it.

==Transport==
Following the opening of the original business park, the [[N82 road (Ireland)|N82]] [[National secondary road|National road]] joining the [[N81 road (Ireland)|N81]] to the [[N7 road (Ireland)|Naas dual carriageway]] was re-routed through the site, having previously passed through the village of Saggart. 

[[Dublin Bus]] routes 65b, 69, 69x, 77a, 77x, and the 175 by [[Go-Ahead Ireland]], as well as feeder services to Tallaght, and a private commuter bus operated by the business campus management, serve the campus.

===Luas ===
The Luas Line ''A1 Citywest extension'', from Belgard to Saggart, was officially opened at Citywest Drive on 2 July 2011 by the Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar.  The following stops were constructed on the line - Fettercairn, Cheeverstown, Citywest Campus, Fortunestown (also serving Citywest Shopping Centre) and Saggart. Citywest Campus is the main stop for the campus, but parts are also served by Cheeverstown and Fortunestown stops. A park-and-ride facility was constructed at the Cheeverstown stop with free park-and-ride facilities also located at Citywest Shopping Centre and near the Citywest Campus Luas stop.

==Sport==
A golf complex, previously the Citywest and Hibernian Golf Club and now simply Citywest Golf Resort, was laid-out, and then the Citywest Hotel, the largest in Ireland, with over 764 rooms,&lt;ref name="Receiver"/&gt; was built adjacent.  The hotel, golf resort and related developments were placed in receivership in mid-2010 but are still open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0707/1224274192436.html |title=Mansfield's Citywest Hotel placed into receivership as going concern |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |first=Ciarán |last=Hancock |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two 18-hole courses in the golf resort - both designed by Christy O'Connor Junior - and it hosted the Irish Masters in 1994 and the Irish Ladies Masters in 1996.  The hotel has a 4,000 seat convention centre.

==Amenities==
[[File:Citywest-Shopping-Centre G.jpg|thumb|Citywest Shopping Centre]]
The Citywest Shopping Centre, anchored by Dunnes Stores, also has outlets for McCabes Pharmacy, Costa Coffee, McDonald's, Domino's, Baked Patisserie &amp; Cafe, Chopped and Eddie Rockets. There are also a service station and restaurants.

==Education==
[[File:Tony Ryan Academy 3565w.jpg|thumb|Ryan Academy]]
Citywest hosts a [[Dublin City University]] branch facility, the 'Ryan Academy' (previously part of a larger concept, the Eeolas Institute, which closed after major losses).

Three National Schools, one under the patronage of [[Educate Together]] and another under the patronage of the [[Engineering and Technology Board|ETB]], opened their doors in 2012. The schools, ''Citywest Educate Together National School'' and ''Citywest &amp; Saggart Community National School'', are based at a temporary location in a building next to the Saggart Red Line Luas stop (Citywest Heritage Village), and in 2014 Scoil Aoife Community National School opened on Citywest Drive.

==Governance==
Citywest lies within the jurisdiction of [[South Dublin County Council]].

'''Craig Cohon''' is a London-based, [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman known for his role in bringing both [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Cirque du Soleil]] to [[Russia]].  A [[University of Western Ontario]] graduate and Advisory Board member, Cohon is also known for his work in the early 2000s in international development and London community building and for the last decade deeply involved in the nighttime entertainment business in Moscow and recently in London.

==Early life==
Cohon was born at [[Michael Reese Hospital]] in the South Side of Chicago, the eldest of two children of Susan Silver Cohon (Born 1938), a philanthropist and [[George Cohon]] (Born 1937), a former lawyer and Founder of McDonald's in Canada and Russia. His grandparents on both sides emigrated from Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania and Latvia.

Cohon moved with his parents and younger brother Mark to [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in 1968 when he was five years old. He attended [[Upper Canada College]] where he excelled in rugby and also took up the saxophone which he plays to this day. Cohon went on to graduate from the economics and music faculty from [[The University of Western Ontario]] where he was heavily involved in student politics, was the Business Editor of the University newspaper, worked at the campus radio station and started a TV station on campus - playing in a band, throughout.  Cohon also created the first Annual Western Charity Ball (1984) with Alan Thicke that continues to this day, raising millions of dollars for local London and Canadian charities.

Cohon got the travel bug in 1985 and has worked and traveled to 97 countries but calls London home and has lived there since 1999. As well as spending 15 years in Canada, Cohon has also spent 12 in the USA, five years in Russia, two years in Sweden, two years in Norway and three months each in India, South Africa, Chile and Venezuela.

Post university, Cohon became one of the first Canadian venturers for the UK charity Operation Raleigh and participated in Operation 5C in 1985 to Southern Chile. He helped to build a school in Puerto Montt and completed a road survey on horseback for the extension of the [[Pan American Highway]] (which has now been built).

==Corporate career==
He came out of the jungle in May 1986, saw a Coca-Cola sign on a hut and went on to work for the company for 14 years. Cohon quickly grew through the ranks within Coca-Cola USA from 1986-1991. He was given the Miami territory and he started selling Coca-Cola to mom and pop restaurants from a banana-coloured station wagon and after two years had become one of the top salesmen in the country. Cohon was soon promoted to the company's headquarters in Atlanta and went on to train hundreds of Coca-Cola salespeople across the United States.

Two months after the opening of the Soviet Union's first McDonald's restaurant in Moscow in early 1991, his future mentor Donald Keough, President and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company worldwide, appointed Cohon as the company's first employee in the Soviet Union. He spent six months living in the communist party hotel Octoberskya 2 in Moscow where he learned to speak fluent Russian, worked at the local Soviet beverage factory, rode trucks, and traveled to every metro station in the city, convincing the leadership of Coca-Cola to invest in Russia. From age 27  to 31 he launched the brand to the Russians and led the construction of Coca-Cola's first factory in the former Soviet Union. Cohon and his friends and family were hosted by President Gorbachev at his 30th birthday party. He was often followed by the KGB and went public on Russian radio with tapes after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Just prior to the first Soviet Coca-Cola plant opening, a rocket-propelled hand grenade was launched at his office early one morning in October 1993, luckily causing little damage.

Cohon was eventually promoted to European Division Marketing Director and moved to Oslo, running the marketing for 15 countries in Northern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He then moved to Atlanta for four years where he was responsible for Brand Coca-Cola worldwide, including its activation at the [[1996 Atlanta Olympic Games]].

After his extended tenure, he chose to jump off the traditional corporate career path and spend three years as Director of Learning Strategy for the Coca-Cola European Group. His personal coach was Peter Senge, famous author of The Fifth Discipline. He helped the senior Coca-Cola European leadership team create shared vision around the changing beverage landscape and started to move the organisation to a more responsible corporate agenda.

Cohon moved to London in 1999 and was promoted to be Deputy Division President of The Northwest Europe Division.

Cohon was nominated to the Class of 1999 Global Leaders for Tomorrow at the World Economic Forum. It was in the midst of the anti-globalisation movement and after attending Davos and hearing former American President Clinton speak about the need to evolve capitalism to make it more equitable for all, he decided to leave The Coca-Cola Company and left a substantial amount of stock options on the table to pursue a more purposeful life and career.

He went on to work for Klaus Schwab, Founder of the World Economic Forum for six months, deeply engaging in the world of international organisations, understanding the world of Global NGOs and pushing the corporate social responsibility agenda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/58c09746-48bd-11d9-9162-00000e2511c8.html#axzz4K2ujM3M1&lt;/ref&gt; Perceiving the challenge of making a personal impact on global issues, in 2001 he founded Globalegacy and focused his efforts on making an impact in London's urban communities.

After teaching at the [[London Business School]] for a summer, he hired 10 students and began to craft a vision for Globalegacy. Cohon focused his efforts on East London and quickly moved into an office container near Bromley-By-Bow. He worked closely with local government authorities the LDA, Bromley-by-Bow Centre and Leaside Regeneration to begin to craft a local development strategy that worked for all prior to the awarding of the [[2012 Olympic Games]].

Cohon then decided to take his expertise back internationally. He teamed up with world-renowned city development expert Jeb Brugmann and global business guru, CK Prahalad, author of ''Fortune at The Bottom of the Pyramid'' to own and lead an international development strategic advisory firm. Together they helped create and support two thriving businesses for people in poverty. One started with BP, now called First Energy, is a leading provider of clean energy stoves for businesses and kitchens throughout India. The other, RML, was an early stage tech company incubated with Reuters that went on to become an award-winning technology company providing Agri Decision Support Solution for farmers throughout India.

==Honours, Awards and Boards==
In 1993, Cohon received an Honorary Doctorate of Economics from Moscow International University. In 2000, the World Economic Forum named him "A Global Leader for Tomorrow." He was awarded the 2003 Young Alumni Award from the University of Western Ontario&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alumni.westernu.ca/connect/alumni/craig-cohon.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; and now sits on their Global Advisory Board. Cohon is an active supporter of London's soon-to-be-built Garden Bridge project. As well, he gives time to many local charities in London. 
Cohon was one of the first sponsors of London's Ethical Fashion Forum's RE Fashion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethicalfashionforum.com/re-fashion-awards&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also Chairman of Worn Again since 2007, a technology innovation company in development of a circular textile to textile recycling technology&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/how-the-fashion-industry-is-helping-the-worlds-rubbish-problem-a7052826.html&lt;/ref&gt; and working closely with H &amp; M.

Cohon decided to combine his international business experience and his love of Russia to delve into another business: entertainment. Partnering with Guy Laliberte, owner of the world's largest live entertainment company, Cohon brought [[Cirque du Soleil]] to Russia, acting as Vice Chairman of Cirque du Soleil Russia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-07-26/russians-get-circus-from-family-that-gave-them-big-macs-cola&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 he has helped transform the live entertainment business across the country, bringing 11 highly acclaimed international shows to 14 Russian cities which have been seen by 2.3 million people. Cohon spearheaded over 120 million USD investment into the sector and has worked with 40 local Russian and International partners. He also led the implementation of Russia's first electronic ticketing system that provides security, best pricing and freedom of choice to millions of Russians. Cohon's Russian partner is currently finalising plans to build a $50 million USD theatre to house future Cirque du Soleil shows in Moscow.

Throughout this time, Cohon has built a close global network of artists, directors, producers, musicians, stage designers and actors. He has been very engaged in the emerging immersive theatre segment in London and Moscow and continues to actively support the development of these new underground concepts to expand entertainment and nightlife.

==Personal life==
Cohon lives on a barge called Ocean on the River Thames with his teenage son and daughter. Cohon was divorced in 2010 from Dr. Jeanette Sundberg-Cohon after an 18-year relationship.

Cohon is an avid international traveller. He does not own a car and travels throughout London by foot, boat, bike and public transport.

A '''creature of statute''' (also known as '''creature of the state''') is a legal entity, such as a [[corporation]], created by [[statute]]. Creatures of statute may include [[Municipality|municipalities]] and other artificial legal entities or relationships.&lt;ref name="quaqua1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm |title=Creature of the State |website=Quaqua Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as "creatures of statute." The same concept is also expressed with the phrase "creature of the state."&lt;ref name="quaqua1"/&gt;

The term "creature of statute" is most common to the [[United States]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], these bodies are simply called [[statutory corporation]]s (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the [[Companies Act 1985]] specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (''e.g.'', a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as "creatures of statute" to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. [[Australia]] also uses the term "creature of statute" to describe some governmental bodies.

The importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of statute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas.

'''Ebenezer Cooke''' (14 May 1832 – 7 May 1907)&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; was a [[South Australia]]n accountant, Member of Parliament and Commissioner of Audit.

Cooke was born in [[London]], [[England]] where his eldest brother, the Rev. John Cooke, was a noted Egyptologist&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57507425 Death of Mr. E. Cooke] ''South Australian Register'' 8 May 1907 p.5 accessed 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of ''The Freeman'', a Baptist weekly newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bq/27-2_050.pdf Taylor, Rosemary ''English Baptist Periodicals, 1790-1865''] pp. 72, 73 accessed 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accountant==
In 1863 Ebenezer Cooke was sent out to the colony of South Australia by the [[English and Australian Copper Company]] as accountant for their smelting works in St. Vincent Street, [[Port Adelaide, South Australia|Port Adelaide]]. He took on role of superintendent then (on the death of general manager James Hamilton in 1871&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39256680 Mr. James Hamilton] ''South Australian Register'' 12 August 1871 Supplement p.7 accessed 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) was officially appointed to that position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39241774/3958380 English and Australian Copper Company] ''South Australian Register'' 26 December 1871 p.5 accessed 11 November 2011&lt;br&gt;Includes some incidental information about the company, which handled the massive output from the Burra mines.&lt;/ref&gt; which he held until [[recruiter|"headhunted"]] by the Public Service in 1882. He was replaced by Frederick Ireland who, like Cooke, was promoted from the post of Accountant.

==Politics==
On 1 March 1875 he was elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly]] as member for [[Electoral district of Flinders|Flinders]],&lt;ref name=parl&gt;
{{cite SA-parl
 |pid=3579
 |name=Ebenezer Cooke
 |accessdate=7 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing northern towns such as [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]] with colleagues [[Patrick Boyce Coglin]] and [[John Williams (South Australian politician)|John Williams]]. In 1878 he was re-elected for the same district, with [[William Ranson Mortlock]] taking the place of Williams. In 1881 Cooke was once more successful, his fellow-members being Mortlock and A. Tennant.
:"During these years Mr. Cooke was a most regular attendant in the House, and he developed a reputation as an analyst of budget speeches. He was not fond of debating ordinary subjects, but when matters were before the House in which financial questions were involved Mr. Cooke was listened to with the utmost attention by all parties, because he used to study his subjects so fully and seemed to be able to fathom every point involved. His attention to detail became almost wearisome at times, but it all went to prove the true value of the man as a student of financial subjects."&lt;ref name=obit2/&gt;
On 31 July 1879 he was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Finance, which ran for nearly three years. The Commission's final report, dated 2 May 1882, recommended the creation of an Audit Office with two Commissioners of Audit. These recommendations were accepted with Cooke and Alfred Heath appointed to the top jobs. This necessitated his retirement from parliament; he resigned on 24 October 1882,&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5064446 Death of Mr. E. Clarke] ''Advertiser (Adelaide)'' 8 May 1907 p.7 accessed 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; though he did retain the position of attorney for the English and Australian Copper Company and directorship of the related English Copper Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43464496 Government Defeat on the Audit Bill] ''South Australian Register'' 11 July 1883 p.4 accessed 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Auditor==
He took up the post in February 1883. He and Heath (who had been appointed to counterbalance Cooke's suspected political loyalties) worked harmoniously and efficiently,&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; but when Heath retired (or was relieved of his position), Cooke continued in the role alone with no obvious reduction in the Office's effectiveness. He
:"possessed uncommon gifts as a mathematician, a vein of dry humour, he was well informed on all current topics, with a particularly good knowledge of the political history of the State and of Australia centrally and, tbough he at one time took a prominent part in public affairs, and discussed with avidity questioned before Parliament, after his induction to the control of the Audit Office he 'knew no politics'"&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;
Under his leadership, the Audit Office evolved from an investigative body to a powerful arm of Government, giving advice, and to some extent control, outside its original remit.
He supported the formation of the Public Service Association in 1884, and was its first president.

==Family==
He was the brother of Rev. J. Hunt Cooke of [[Richmond, Surrey]].
He married Eliza Peyton (née  Ogden) (c. 1833 – 16 April 1865) in London in 1859. Their children were

He was a keen mathematician and the author of ''The A.B.C. Perpetual Calendar'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59013714 Obituary] ''South Australian Register'' 12 July 1924 p.14 accessed 12 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a Fellow of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48524768 Conference on Theosophy] ''South Australian Register'' 18 May 1893 p.3 accessed 12 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He married Jessie Elizabeth Greayer (died 1944) at the [[Adelaide Unitarian Christian Church]], [[Wakefield Street, Adelaide]] on 30 June 1887.

[[File:Zonmar-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Sea areas in international rights]]

An '''exclusive economic zone''' ('''EEZ''') is a sea zone prescribed by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] over which a [[Sovereign state|state]] has special rights regarding the exploration and use of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[Natural resource|resources]], including energy production from water and wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Part V – Exclusive Economic Zone, Article 56 |url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm |work=Law of the Sea |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretches from the baseline out to 200&amp;nbsp;[[nautical mile]]s (nmi) from its coast. In colloquial usage, the term may include the [[continental shelf]]. The term does not include either the [[territorial sea]] or the [[continental shelf]] beyond the 200 nmi limit. The difference between the [[territorial sea]] and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full [[sovereignty]] over the waters, whereas the second is merely a "sovereign right" which refers to the coastal state's rights below the surface of the sea. The surface waters, as can be seen in the map, are [[international waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Part V – Exclusive Economic Zone, Articles 55, 56 |url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm |work=Law of the Sea |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Territorial waters - World.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The World's exclusive economic zones, shown in dark blue]]
[[File:Map of the Territorial Waters of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean.png|thumb|upright=1.35|EEZs in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean]]
[[File:Map of the Territorial Waters of the Pacific Ocean.png|thumb|upright=1.35|EEZs in the Pacific Ocean]]
Generally, a state's exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance of no more than {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} out from its coastal [[Baseline (sea)|baseline]]. The exception to this rule occurs when exclusive economic zones would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than {{convert|400|nmi|km|abbr=on}} apart. When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual [[maritime boundary]].&lt;ref name=SLO1&gt;William R. Slomanson, 2006. Fundamental Perspectives on International Law, 5th edn. Belmont, CA: Thomson-Wadsworth, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.&lt;ref&gt;UN Convention on the Law of The Sea.&lt;/ref&gt;

A state's exclusive economic zone starts at the seaward edge of its territorial sea and extends outward to a distance of {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} from the baseline. The exclusive economic zone stretches much further into sea than the [[territorial waters]], which end at {{convert|12|nmi|km|abbr=on}} from the coastal baseline (if following the rules set out in the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm] 1982 UN Convention on the Law of The Sea.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the [[contiguous zone]]. States also have rights to the [[seabed]] of what is called the [[continental shelf]] up to {{convert|350|nmi|km|abbr=on}} from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones. The legal definition of the continental shelf does not directly correspond to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.

==Origin==
The idea of allotting nations EEZs to give them more control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century.

Initially, a country's sovereign territorial waters extended {{convert|3|nmi|km|disp=or|abbr=on}} (range of cannon shot) beyond the shore. In modern times, a country's sovereign territorial waters extend to {{convert|12|nmi|km|abbr=on}} beyond the shore. One of the first assertions of exclusive jurisdiction beyond the traditional territorial seas was made by the [[United States]] in the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Proclamation of September 28, 1945. However, it was [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] respectively that first claimed maritime zones of 200 nautical miles with the Presidential Declaration Concerning Continental Shelf of 23 June 1947 (El Mercurio, Santiago de Chile, 29 June 1947) and Presidential Decree No. 781 of 1 August 1947 (El Peruano: Diario {{Not a typo|Oficial}}. Vol. 107, No. 1983, 11 August 1947).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/s5280T/s5280t0p.htm The Exclusive Economic Zone: A Historical Perspective]. Fao.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1982 with the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]] that the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone was formally adopted.

==Disputes==

The exact extent of exclusive economic zones is a common source of conflicts between states over marine waters.

* Norway and Russia dispute both territorial sea and EEZ with regard to the [[Svalbard]] archipelago as it affects Russia's EEZ due to its [[Svalbard Treaty|unique treaty status]]. A treaty was agreed in principle in April 2010 between the two states and subsequently ratified,  resolving this demarcation dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/world/europe/28norway.html Russia and Norway Reach Accord on Barents Sea], ''New York Times'', 28 April 2010, Accessed 28 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was signed in Murmansk on September 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/russia-norway-arctic-border-dispute Russia and Norway resolve Arctic border dispute], ''Guardian'', 15 September 2010, Accessed 21 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[South China Sea]] (and the [[Spratly Islands]]) is the site of an ongoing dispute between several neighboring nations.
* [[Croatia]]'s ZERP ([[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]]) in the Adriatic Sea caused friction with [[Italy]] and [[Slovenia]], and caused problems during [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia's accession to the European Union]].
* A wedge-shaped section of the [[Beaufort Sea]] is disputed between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], as the area reportedly contains substantial [[oil reserves]].
* [[France]] claims a portion of Canada's EEZ for [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]] based on a new definition of the continental shelf and EEZ between the two countries. [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]] is entirely surrounded by Canada's EEZ.
* [[Mauritius]] claims EEZ for [[Tromelin]] from France and EEZ for [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] from the UK.
* [[Turkey]] claims a portion of [[Cyprus]]'s EEZ based on Turkey's peculiar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/international/der-zypernkonflikt-behindert-den-zugriff-auf-die-schaetze-im-oestlichen-mittelmeer-ld.1434451|title=Im östlichen Mittelmeer sollen Erdgasvorkommen von mehreren Billionen Kubikmetern liegen.

* [[Lebanon]] claims that the agreement between [[Cyprus]] and [[Israel]] overlapped its own EEZ.

===Potential disputes===
Regions where a permanent [[ice shelf]] extends beyond the coastline are also a source of potential dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alsa.asn.au/files/acj/1996/cripps.html The Legal Status of Ice in the Antarctic Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227142709/http://www.alsa.asn.au/files/acj/1996/cripps.html |date=2006-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolved disputes===
* The [[Cod Wars]] between the United Kingdom and [[Iceland]] occurred periodically over many decades, until they were resolved with a final agreement in 1976.
* In 1999, following the [[Hanish Islands conflict]], the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] ruled that the EEZs of [[Yemen]] and [[Eritrea]] should be demarcated equidistantly between the [[mainland]]s of the two nations, without taking account of sovereignty over the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AWARD OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL IN THE SECOND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS (MARITIME DELIMITATION)|url=http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1160|publisher=Permanent Court of Arbitration|accessdate=12 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412132024/http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1160|archivedate=12 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwiatkowska|first1=Barbara|title=The Eritrea-Yemen Arbitration: Landmark Progress in the Acquisition of Territorial Sovereignty and Equitable Maritime Boundary Delimitation|journal=Ocean Development and International Law|date=January 2001|volume=32|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00908320150502177|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263716135_The_Eritrea-Yemen_Arbitration_Landmark_Progress_in_the_Acquisition_of_Territorial_Sovereignty_and_Equitable_Maritime_Boundary_Delimitation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transboundary stocks==
{{See also|Highly migratory species}}
[[Fisheries management]], usually adhering to guidelines set by the [[FAO]], provides significant practical mechanisms for the control of EEZs. Transboundary fish stocks are an important concept in this control.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: The State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2006 [http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0699e/A0699E07.htm ''Part3: highlights of Special studies''] Rome. {{ISBN|978-92-5-105568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Transboundary stocks are [[fish stock]]s that range in the EEZs of at least two countries. [[Straddling stock]]s, on the other hand, range both within an EEZ as well as in the [[high seas]], outside any EEZ. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.&lt;ref name="FAO 2007"&gt;[[FAO]] (2007) [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/i0150e/i0150e00.pdf Report of the FAO workshop on vulnerable ecosystems and destructive fishing in deep sea fisheries] Rome, Fisheries Report No. 829.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]]'s Exclusive Economic Zone was declared on 1 August 1994, and extends from 12 [[nautical mile]]s to 200 nautical miles (370&amp;nbsp;km) from the coastline of Australia and its [[States and territories of Australia|external territories]], except where a maritime [[delimitation]] agreement exists with another state.&lt;ref name=EEZ&gt;[http://www.agriculture.gov.au/fisheries/domestic/zone The Australian Fishing Zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSA"&gt;Geoscience Australia. 2005.

Australia has the third largest exclusive economic zone, behind France and the United States, but ahead of [[Russia]], with the total area of 8,148,250 square kilometres, which actually exceeds its land territory.

The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] confirmed, in April 2008, Australia's rights over an additional 2.5 million square kilometres of seabed beyond the limits of Australia's EEZ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/UNCONFIRMSAUSTRALIA’SRIGHTSOVEREXTRA.aspx UN confirms Australia’s rights over extra 2.5 million square kilometres of seabed.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025165652/http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/UNCONFIRMSAUSTRALIA%E2%80%99SRIGHTSOVEREXTRA.aspx |date=2009-10-25 }} Minister for Resources and Energy, The Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, Media Release, 21 April 2008.{{cite web |url=http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/UNCONFIRMSAUSTRALIA’SRIGHTSOVEREXTRA.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827172656/http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/UNCONFIRMSAUSTRALIA%E2%80%99SRIGHTSOVEREXTRA.aspx |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAEEZ" /&gt; Australia also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, additional Continental Shelf past its EEZ from the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]],&lt;ref name="CLCS"&gt;Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.

[[Greece]] has claimed an exclusive economic zone, as it is entitled to do so, as per UNCLOS 1982 as well as customary international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellasfrappe.blogspot.com.es/2013/02/indirect-proclamation-of-eez-greece.html Indirect Proclamation of EEZ – Greece Gives Coordinates Of Continental Shelf To UN ~ HellasFrappe].

According to published maps, the [[Israel]] government has recognized the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of Greece and [[Cyprus]]. They describe the course of the gas pipeline which will transfer gas produced by American Νoble Εnergy Ltd. from the Leviathan reservoir to Europe, through an undersea pipeline crossing Greece. The gas pipeline should traverse the sea area, which according to international law, is part of the Greek EEZ. By this proposal, Israel recognizes the Greek EEZ in the area and offers an advantage that Greece can use during negotiation procedures to support its claims on the area. In practice, this cooperation will set up a powerful energy coalition between Greece, Cyprus and Israel.  The mining and operating part will be undertaken by an American company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.greekreporter.com/2011/02/23/israel-recognizes-greek-exclusive-economic-zone/ Israel Recognizes Greek Exclusive Economic Zone | News from Greeks in Africa, Asia, and South America].

===Israel===
In 2010, an agreement was signed with [[Cyprus]] concerning the limit of territorial waters between [[Israel]] and Cyprus at the maritime halfway point, a clarification essential for safeguarding Israel's rights to oil and underwater gas reservoirs. The agreement was signed in Nicosia by Israeli Infrastructure Minister [[Uzi Landau]] and the Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou.

The United Kingdom's exclusive economic zone is the [[Exclusive Economic Zone#Rankings by area|fifth largest in the world]] at 6,805,586 square km. It comprises the exclusive economic zones surrounding the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/3161/contents/made "The Exclusive Economic Zone Order 2013"] http://www.legislation.gov.uk. Retrieved 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Crown Dependencies]], and the [[British Overseas Territories]]. The figure does not include the EEZ of the [[British Antarctic Territory]]. The exclusive economic zones associated with the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] are disputed by [[Argentina]]. The EEZ of the [[Chagos archipelago]] also known as the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] is also disputed with [[Mauritius]] which considers the EEZ as part of its territory.

The UK was late to establish an EEZ, relying on overlapping maritime zones for fisheries, pollution control, and energy matters. The [[Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009]] gave the powers to establish an EEZ, with the zone defined by [[The Exclusive Economic Zone Order 2013]] which came into force on 31 March 2014.&lt;ref name=gibson-2009&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289913369_The_United_Kingdom's_elusive_exclusive_economic_zone |title=The United Kingdom's elusive exclusive economic zone |last=Gibson |first=J. |journal=Journal of Water Law |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=January 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legislation-20131211&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/3161/made |title=The Exclusive Economic Zone Order 2013 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |date=11 December 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the United Kingdom and [[Gibraltar]] are part of the EU. The [[Crown dependencies]] and the remaining overseas territories (that is, all except Gibraltar) are not part of the EU. The United Kingdom has not as yet claimed its rights with regards to Gibraltar or the [[Sovereign Base Areas]] in Cyprus.

==Reactors ==
The [[ABWR|Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR)]] is the world's first operational Generation III Class advanced light water reactor design.  The NRC has docketed GEH's petition for renewal of ABWR certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://federalregister.gov/a/2011-3734&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]] (ESBWR), the Generation III+ Class design reactor, received a positive final safety evaluation report and final design approval in March 2011, and is expected to receive a license from the NRC by September 2011.&lt;ref name=street&gt;

The '''globally integrated enterprise''' is a term coined in 2006 by [[Sam Palmisano]], the then CEO of [[IBM]] Corp, used to denote "a company that fashions its strategy, its management, and its operations in pursuit of a new goal: the integration of [[Manufacturing|production]] and [[Value chain|value delivery]] worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibm.com/ibm/governmentalprograms/samforeignaffairs.pdf | title = The Globally Integrated Enterprise | first = Sam | last = Palmisano | date = 15 March 2006 | accessdate = 10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Argument==
Palmisano argues that in the [[international]] model of the 20th century, most operations were centred in their home country, with only elements of sales and distribution happening overseas.
The multinational model of the 21st century&amp;mdash;in which companies created small versions of themselves in each country&amp;mdash;was a response to the [[trade barriers]] that arose after the [[World Wars]].  For IBM&amp;mdash;Palmisano's employer&amp;mdash;this was a successful model because it enabled the company to grow in those markets, understand local customer requirements and cultivate local talent.  But it also created [[wikt:redundancy|redundancy]] or [[wikt:duplication|duplication]] as each country had its own [[Back office|back-office]] functions, such as&amp;mdash; [[Supply chain|supply]], [[procurement]], [[finance]] and [[human resources]].

Now the globally integrated enterprise can locate functions anywhere in the world, based on the right cost, skills and environment, argues Palmisano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Colin|title=IBM boss spells out a better future|url=http://news.cnet.com/IBM-boss-spells-out-a-better-future/2100-1014_3-6082779.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, IBM now has one supply chain; and this new [[Organizational structure|organizational]] [[Macrostructure (sociology)|macrostructure]] has [[emergence|emerged]] because [[Complex adaptive system#General properties|everything is connected]], and work can move to the place where it is performed cheapest. This approach is made possible due to the rise of [[globalization]], and coming down of many of the barriers that haltered [[cross-border]] [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Globalisation's offspring|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8960441?story_id=8960441|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Economist|date=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmisano mentions the ''Law of Global Integration'', driven by three forces&amp;mdash;economics, expertise and openness&amp;mdash;without explicitly stating what it is or how it can be verified.

==Criticisms==
[[Brad Setser]] of [[RGE Monitor|Roubini Global Economics (RGE) Monitor]] wrote:
:'In my view, this underscores a key element of tension in America’s current backlash against globalization that was not evident in the late 1980s. Today, the pressures are being borne disproportionately by labor, whereas 20 years ago, capital and labor were in the struggle together. In the late 1980s, many of the once proud icons of Corporate America were fighting for competitive survival at the same time that US workers were feeling the heat of global competition. The pain was, in effect, balanced. Today, US companies, as seen through the lens of corporate profitability, are thriving as never before while the American [[workforce]] is increasingly isolated in its competitive squeeze. In essence, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labor]] are working very much at cross purposes in the current climate, whereas back in the late 1980s they were both in the same boat.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.relooney.info/0_New_2372.pdf |title= Global Protectionist Threats: Then and Now |date= 26 January 2007 |accessdate= 10 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hassan Allam.PNG|thumb|Hassan Allam|right]]

'''Hassan Mohammed Allam''' (1903 &amp;ndash; 3 January 1976) was one of the pioneers of modern construction in Egypt.

== Early life and career ==
Hassan Allam was born in [[Port Said]] and subsequently moved to the Upper Egyptian town of [[Minya, Egypt|Al Minya]] with his family. His father owned a small shop that sold [[construction materials]] including tiles and ceramics imported from [[Great Britain]]. Allam attended [[primary school]] but did not continue his education, joining his father's business instead.

In 1923 at the age of 19, he immigrated to [[Cairo]] where he formed a small informal [[building contractor|contracting outfit]]. In 1936, he founded Hassan Mohammed Allam &amp; Co. for General Contracting - a [[limited partnership]] company.&lt;ref name=haholding&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.allamsons.com/AboutUs/|publisher=Hassan Allam Holding|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having received no formal education in the field of construction, his [[managerial]] and [[Technology|technical]] expertise were substantial. He was also widely popular with construction labourers and engineers.&lt;!-- Is this chronology correct? He was popular from the very start of his career? --&gt;

== First major contracts ==

In 1938, [[King Farouk]] was on his way to [[Ismalia]] when he was injured in a car accident and was whisked to the nearby [[Kassassin|village of Kassassin]] to be treated in a small medical facility. As a result of the incident, the King ordered that a hospital be built in the area. Hassan Allam thus landed his first major contract and El Kassaseen Hospital was built on the [[Cairo]]-to-[[Ismaïlia]] agricultural road. Other early contracts included the Mebara hospital in [[Port Said]], a [[power station]] in [[Damanhur]], and the first Egyptian [[oil refinery]] in [[Suez]]. His firm was beginning to seriously compete with El Abd Pasha, Ahmad Bakir (a road contractor) and Ali Ibrahim Pasha (whose work include the Television Building and the [[Tahrir Office Complex]] in Cairo). Eventually the company became one of the largest in the construction field in the country together with [[Osman Ahmad Osman]]'s [[Arab Contractors Co.]].

== An unknowing early supporter of Anwar el-Sadat ==

Allam unknowingly protected [[Anwar el-Sadat]] in his early years. In the 1940s, [[Anwar el-Sadat|Sadat]] in an effort to evade [[political persecution]], disguised himself as a truck driver and took a job in Hassan Allam's company. Sadat later became the third [[president of Egypt]].

== Adjusting to political change over the years ==

After the 1952 revolution, the company continued to thrive and executed a number of major roads such as the Ismalia-[[Al 'Arish]], Suez-[[Marsa Alam]], and [[Alexandria]]-[[Marsa Matruh]] highways. Many projects were also completed in [[Port Said]] that included a large [[cathedral]] and a [[mosque]]. Prior to the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]], the company was in charge of building a new community for the [[Nubian people]] whose villages lay in the area that was later to become [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;!-- Was this a popular project with the Nubians? --&gt;

In 1961, the company was nationalized under President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]’s new socialist policies to become Nasr General Contracting - Hassan Mohammed Allam with Hassan Allam losing ownership and becoming its general manager.&lt;!-- How did Allam feel about this change? --&gt;

In 1975, taking advantage of the [[Infitah]] or [[open door policy|open-door policies]] adopted by President [[Anwar el-Sadat]]’s government, he established his second company - [[Hassan Allam Sons]]. Shortly after, the new company submitted a bid for building a large sewage network in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. However Hassan Allam did not live to see the result of the bid. His funeral was held at the [[Omar Makram Mosque]] in [[Tahrir Square]] and was attended by thousands of mourners. The crowd extended from the mosque almost up to the Ramesses [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]].

There are currently two streets named after Hassan Allam; one in the [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] district and the other in [[Downtown Cairo]].

The book chronicles the history of [[Bear Stearns]], from its founding in 1923 to its [[fire sale]] to [[JP Morgan]] in 2008, following the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

==Profiles of bank executives==
The book documents the rise of [[Alan C. Greenberg|Alan "Ace" Greenberg]], and his unsuccessful power struggle with [[Master Individual|bridgemaster]] &amp; bond trader [[James Cayne]], the power struggle between "co-presidents" Warren J. Spector &amp; [[Alan Schwartz]], and the recklessness of the over-leveraged [[hedge fund]] supervised by [[Richard Marin (investment banker)|Richard A. Marin]] and Ralph R. Cioffi. The text also tells the story of [[Salim L. Lewis|Salim Lewis]].

==Awards==
The book was on the [[Short list|long list]] for the 2009 [[Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ac05a258-839a-11de-a24e-00144feabdc0.html |title= Business books - 2009 long list |publisher= [[Financial Times]] |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate= 2011-03-20| quote=...William Cohan, the 2007 winner of the prize, was quick enough off the mark with ''House of Cards'', which documents the fall of Bear Stearns in spring 2008, while David Wessel’s ''In Fed We Trust'', an account of how Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, tackled the crisis, brings the story right up to this summer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Tim Rutten]] characterized the book as a "masterfully reported account", and credited the author with a "remarkable gift for plain-spoken explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rutten| first = Tim | author-link = Tim Rutten | title = 'House of Cards' by William D.

After his retirement, Larry developed a second career as a prominent [[philatelist]] internationally recognized in the field of [[postal history]].&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] 10 Oct 1974 "Lawrence L. Shenfield, 83; Philatelists and Ad Executive"&lt;/ref&gt;  His careful studies of the [[postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States]] are relied upon by [[stamp collectors]] and experts in [[philately]] to the present day.

== Background and business career ==
[[File:Lawrence L Shenfield and Dinah Shore.jpg|thumb|[[Dinah Shore]] with Lawrence Shenfield]]
Mr. Shenfield was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Births Reported in October 1891 | publisher = Brooklyn Genealogy Information Page | url = http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Birth/1891/1891.OctBirth.html | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his undergraduate degree in architecture in 1914 from [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] and served in the U.S. Army during [[World War I]], having undergone [[artillery]] training in [[Plattsburgh]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Plattsburg, New York Training Camp, 1917 | publisher = New River Notes | url = http://www.newrivernotes.com/ww1/plattsburg.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, Shenfield worked in New York as an architect for [[Eggers &amp; Higgins]] and designed a number of buildings in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]].  

Subsequently, Shenfield left architecture for the rapidly growing field of radio and television advertising.  He worked for the advertising firm Pedlar &amp; Ryan, where he handled advertising and public relations for radio broadcasts by [[Orson Welles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilson | first = Jeff | title = "A New Kind of Radio Program": Orson Welles (Lady Esther) | publisher = WellesNet.com | url = http://www.wellesnet.com/R_LE_OV.htm | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Shenfield became a principal in the advertising firm Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield.  In 1939, Shenfield became acquainted with [[Dinah Shore]] and was instrumental in launching her career by promoting the nationwide [[CBS]] radio program, ''Ben Bernie's Orchestra'' as well as the [[NBC]] Radio program [[The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street]].  In 1965, Shenfield retired after Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield merged with Maurice H. Needham Co., forming the predecessor of the [[Omnicom Group]], one of the world's largest advertising holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Omnicom Group Inc. | publisher = FundingUniverse.com| url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Omnicom-Group-Inc-Company-History.html | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Shenfield returned briefly from retirement to provide support for Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield's and [[Merck &amp; Co.]]'s lawsuit against the [[Federal Trade Commission]] concerning truth and fairness in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield, Inc., Petitioner, v.

== Philatelic career ==

Shenfield was a prominent expert, collector and writer of [[philatelic literature]] on [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[philately]].  In 1942, he published a pamphlet on [[Prisoner of War]] and [[Flag of Truce]] mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tear Sheets | publisher = Stamps4Collectors.com | url = http://www.stamps4collectors.com/tearsheets/s1.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shenfield subsequently was active in the [[Collectors Club of New York]] and numerous [[philatelic]] congresses. At the 1946 Philatelic Congress, Shenfield presented ''Letter Unpaid Marking of Louisville, Kentucky''.&lt;ref name="pbbooks"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hartmann | first = Leonard H. | title = Books on Philately: Confederate States of America | publisher = pbbooks.com | url = http://pbbooks.com/csa.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the Confederate Stamp Alliance awarded Shenfield the Haydn Myer Award in recognition of his distinguished service to the Alliance.&lt;ref name="Confederate Stamp Alliance"&gt;{{cite web | title = A concise history of the Confederate Stamp Alliance | publisher = The Confederate Stamp Alliance | url = http://www.csalliance.org/csa-1.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623230509/http://www.csalliance.org/csa-1.htm | archivedate = 2008-06-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, along with F. Van Dyk MacBride, Shenfield co-chaired the editorial board for the Dietz Confederate Catalog and Handbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = APS Hall of Fame 1960-1964 | publisher = [[American Philatelic Society]] | year = 1999 | url = http://www.stamps.org/almanac/alm_halloffame_1960-64.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shenfield's most widely known book on [[Confederate States postal history]], ''Confederate States of America, The Special Postal Routes'', was published in 1961.&lt;ref name="pbbooks"/&gt; The book is generally known as the best single source for the various special postal operations of the [[Confederate States of America]] and is regarded as a major reference work in the area of Confederate [[philately]] by prominent philatelic [[auction]] houses, [[stamp collectors]] and [[philatelists]].&lt;ref name="pbbooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Major Reference Books | publisher = Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries, Inc. | url = http://www.siegelauctions.com/enc/csa/csaref.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps and covers formerly owned by Shenfield in his collection are frequently identified in the catalogues of major philatelic [[auction]] houses due to his prominence in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Jeanette C.

Shenfield died in 1974 and is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)]], New York. After his death, Shenfield's surviving sons, James Philip Shenfield and Lawrence Walker Shenfield, sold Shenfield's collection of Confederate stamps and [[philatelic cover]]s at [[public auction]] through H.R. Harmer in New York City. Each year, Shenfield's essay on Confederate postal usage and routes is included in the introduction to Confederate States stamps in the [[Scott catalogue]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">The '''lead chamber process''' was an industrial method used to produce [[sulfuric acid]] in large quantities. It has been largely supplanted by the [[contact process]].

In 1746 in [[Birmingham]], England, [[John Roebuck]] began producing [[sulfuric acid]] in [[lead]]-lined chambers, which were stronger and less expensive, and could be made much larger, than the [[glass]] containers which had been used previously. This allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production and, with several refinements, this process remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries. So robust was the process that as late as 1946, the chamber process still accounted for 25% of sulfuric acid manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Jones, "Chamber Process Manufacture of Sulfuric Acid", ''Industrial and Engineering Chemistry'', Nov 1950, Vol 42, No. 11, pp 2208–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Sulfur dioxide]] is introduced with steam and [[nitrogen dioxide]] into large chambers lined with sheet [[lead]] where the gases are sprayed down with water and [[chamber acid]] (62–70% Sulfuric acid). The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve and over a period of approximately 30 minutes the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfuric acid. The presence of nitrogen dioxide is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The process is highly [[exothermic]], and a major consideration of the design of the chambers was to provide a way to dissipate the heat formed in the reactions.

Early plants used very large lead-lined wooden rectangular chambers (Faulding box chambers) that were cooled by ambient air. The internal lead sheathing served to contain the corrosive sulfuric acid and to render the wooden chambers waterproof. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, such plants required about half a cubic meter of volume to process the sulfur dioxide equivalent of a kilogram of burned sulfur.{{citation needed|reason=Great fact worthy of inclusion here, but I can't find supporting data.|date=March 2014}}  In the mid-19th century, French chemist [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|Gay-Lussac]] redesigned the chambers as stoneware packed masonry cylinders. In the 20th century, plants using Mills-Packard chambers supplanted the earlier designs. These chambers were tall tapered cylinders that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber.

Sulfur dioxide for the process was provided by burning [[sulfur|elemental sulfur]] or by the [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] of [[Sulfide mineral|sulfur-containing metal ores]] in a stream of air in a furnace. During the early period of manufacture, nitrogen oxides were produced by the decomposition of [[nitre|niter]] at high temperature in the presence of acid, but this process was gradually supplanted by the air oxidation of [[ammonia]] to [[nitric oxide]] in the presence of a catalyst.  The recovery and reuse of oxides of nitrogen was an important economic consideration in the operation of a chamber process plant.

In the reaction chambers, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to produce [[nitrogen dioxide]].  Liquid from the bottom of the chambers is diluted and pumped to the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards in a fine mist. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are absorbed in the liquid and react to form sulfuric acid and nitric oxide. The liberated nitric oxide is sparingly soluble in water and returns to the gas in the chamber where it reacts with oxygen in the air to reform nitrogen dioxide. Some percentage of the nitrogen oxides are sequestered in the reaction liquor as [[nitrosylsulfuric acid]] and as nitric acid, so fresh nitric oxide must be added as the process proceeds. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover tower to reclaim the oxides of nitrogen.

Sulfuric acid produced in the reaction chambers is limited to about 35% concentration.  At higher concentrations, nitrosylsulfuric acid precipitates on the lead walls as [[nitrosylsulfuric acid|chamber crystals]] and is no longer able to [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the oxidation reactions.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Gooch and C. F. Walker, ''Outlines of Inorganic Chemistry'', MacMillan, London, 1905, pp 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemistry ==
Sulfur dioxide is generated by burning elemental [[sulfur]] or by roasting [[pyrite|pyritic ore]] in a current of air:

:S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
:4 FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Nitrogen oxides are produced by decomposition of [[nitre|niter]] in the presence of sulfuric acid or hydrolysis of [[nitrosylsulfuric acid]]:

:2 NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NO + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 NOHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NO + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the reaction chambers, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in the reaction liquor.  Nitrogen dioxide is hydrated to produce [[nitrous acid]] which then oxidizes the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and nitric oxide.  The reactions are not well characterized but it is known that nitrosylsulfuric acid is an intermediate in at least one pathway. The major overall reactions are:

:2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NOHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:NOHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NO
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 2 HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NO

Nitric oxide escapes from the reaction liquor and is subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen to nitrogen dioxide.  This is the overall rate determining step in the process:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp 2209.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 NO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Nitrogen oxides are absorbed and regenerated in the process, and thus serve as a [[catalysis|catalyst]] for the overall reaction:

:2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Maladministration''' is the actions of a government body which can be seen as causing an injustice. The [[law in the United Kingdom]] says Ombudsmen must investigate maladministration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is maladministration? |url= http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04117/SN04117.pdf |agency=House of Commons |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of maladministration is wide and can include:

*Delay
*Incorrect action or failure to take any action
*Failure to follow procedures or the law
*Failure to provide information
*Inadequate record-keeping
*Failure to investigate
*Failure to reply
*Misleading or inaccurate statements
*Inadequate liaison
*Inadequate consultation
*Broken promises

==Early life==
Rimac was born in [[Livno]] [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1988 to Zdenka and Ivan Rimac. His family moved to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] when he was three years old and lived there until 2000 when they moved to [[Samobor]], [[Croatia]] and founded a construction company.&lt;ref name=vijestihr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vijesti.rtl.hr/novosti/zanimljivosti/2931835/mate-rimac-proglasen-poduzetnikom-godine-podsjetimo-se-tko-je-impresivni-tvorac-prvog-hrvatskog-elektricnog-automobila/|title=Mate Rimac proglašen poduzetnikom godine!

He obtained a Bachelor degree in Entrepreneurial Management in 2010.&lt;ref name=vijestihr/&gt; 

At the age of 18, Rimac bought a 1984 BMW E30 323i and raced it. After the gasoline engine exploded during one race, he decided to turn the car into an electric one. He worked on the car in the garage of his parents in Samobor and bought pieces for it on the Internet. This was the groundwork for the car company he established in 2007.&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt;&lt;ref name=TotalCroatiaNews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/news/26823-mate-rimac-2018-entrepreneur-of-the-year-we-need-to-work-together-and-value-success|title=Mate Rimac, 2018 Entrepreneur of the Year: "We Need to Work Together and Value Success"|website=Total Croatia News|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]] [[management]], '''micromanagement''' is a management style whereby a manager closely observes and/or controls the work of his/her subordinates or [[employee]]s. 

Micromanagement is generally considered to have a negative [[connotation]], mainly due to the fact that it shows a lack of freedom in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;Chambers, Harry (2004). [http://www.bkconnection.com/static/mywayPR.pdf ''My Way or the Highway'']. Berrett Koehler Publishers, San Francisco. Retrieved on 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Micromanagement |newspaper=Small Business Resource Centre (2006) |url=http://www.smbresource.com/micromanagement.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724040432/http://www.smbresource.com/micromanagement.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]] defines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/micromanage "Micromanage"], via ''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; micromanagement as "manage[ment] especially with excessive control or attention on details". [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]] defines micromanagement as "manage[ment] or control with excessive attention to minor details".&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com (2008). [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/micromanage ''Definition of micromanage'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The online dictionary [[Encarta]] defined micromanagement as "atten[tion] to small details in management: control [of] a person or a situation by paying extreme attention to small details".&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Dictionary (2008). [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=micromanage ''Definition of micromanage'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5yd3aW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q%3Dmicromanage Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of micromanagement can be extended to any social context where one person takes a [[bullying|bully]] approach in the level of control and influence over the members of a group. Often, this excessive obsession with the most minute of details causes a direct management failure in the ability to focus on the major details.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Rather than giving general instructions on smaller tasks and then devoting time to supervising larger concerns, the micromanager monitors and assesses every step of a business process and avoids [[delegation]] of decisions.&lt;ref name=McConnell&gt;McConnell, Charles (2006). [http://www.nfib.com/object/IO_31411.html ''Micromanagement is Mismanagement'']. National Federation of Independent Business. Retrieved on 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Micromanagers are usually irritated when a subordinate makes decisions without consulting them, even if the decisions are within the subordinate's level of authority.

Micromanagement also frequently involves requests for [[TPS report#In popular culture|unnecessary and overly detailed reports]] ("reportomania"). A micromanager tends to require constant and detailed performance feedback and to focus excessively on procedural trivia (often in detail greater than they can actually process) rather than on overall performance, quality and results. This focus on "low-level" trivia often delays decisions, clouds overall goals and objectives, restricts the flow of information between employees, and guides the various aspects of a project in different and often opposed directions. Many micromanagers accept such inefficiencies as less important than their retention of control or of the appearance of control.

It is common for micromanagers, especially those who exhibit [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] tendencies and/or micromanage deliberately and for [[Strategy|strategic]] reasons, to [[delegate]] work to subordinates and then micromanage those subordinates' performance, enabling the micromanagers in question to both [[Plagiarism|take credit]] for positive results and [[Fall guy|shift the blame]] for negative results to their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David. ''Narcissism: Behind the Mask'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; These micromanagers thereby delegate accountability for failure but not the [[Ought implies can|authority to take alternative actions]] that would have led to success or at least to the mitigation of that failure.

The most extreme cases of micromanagement constitute a management pathology closely related to [[workplace bullying]] and [[narcissism|narcissistic]] behavior. Micromanagement resembles addiction in that although most micromanagers are behaviorally dependent on control over others, both as a lifestyle and as a means of maintaining that lifestyle, many of them fail to recognize and acknowledge their dependence even when everyone around them observes it.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; Some severe cases of micromanagement arise from other underlying mental health conditions such as [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]]. (Renee Kowalski)

Although micromanagement is often easily recognized by employees, micromanagers rarely view themselves as such. In a form of [[denial]] similar to that found in addictive behavior, micromanagers will often rebut allegations of micromanagement by offering a competing characterization of their management style such as "structured", "organized", or "[[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionistic]]".

==Compared with mismanagement==
Micromanagement can be distinguished from the mere tendency of a manager to perform duties assigned to a subordinate. When a manager can perform a worker's job more efficiently than the worker can, the result is merely suboptimal management: although the company suffers [[Opportunity cost|lost opportunities]] because such managers would serve the company even better by doing their own job (see [[comparative advantage]]). In micromanagement, the manager not only tells a subordinate what to do but dictates that the job be done a certain way regardless of whether that way is the most effective or efficient one.

==Causes==
The most frequent motivations for micromanagement, such as detail-orientedness, [[emotional insecurity]], and doubts regarding [[Competence (human resources)|employees' competence]], are internal and related to the personality of the manager. Since manager-employee relationships include a difference in power and often in age, workplace psychologists have used models based on [[transference]] theory to draw analogies between micromanagement relationships and dysfunctional parent-child relationships, ''e.g.'', that both often feature the frequent imposition of [[double bind]]s and/or a tendency by the authority figure to exhibit [[Criticism#Hypercriticism|hypercriticality]].&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; However, external factors such as organizational culture, severe or increased time or performance pressure, severe demands of the regulatory environment, and instability of managerial position (either specific to a micromanager's position or throughout an organization) may also play a role.

In many cases of micromanagement, managers select and implement processes and procedures not for business reasons but rather to enable themselves to feel useful and valuable and/or create the appearance of being so. A frequent cause of such micromanagement patterns is a manager's perception or fear that they lack the competence and creative capability necessary for their position in the larger corporate structure. In reaction to this fear, the manager creates a "fiefdom" within which the manager selects performance standards not on the basis of their relevance to the corporation's interest but rather on the basis of the ability of the manager's division to satisfy them.

Such motivations for micromanagement often intensify, at both the individual-manager and the organization-wide level, during times of economic hardship. In some cases, managers may have proper goals in mind but place disproportionate emphasis on the role of their division and/or on their own personal role in the furtherance of those goals. In others, managers throughout an organization may engage in behavior that, while protective of their division's interests or their personal interests, harms the organization as a whole.

Micromanagement can also stem from a breakdown in the fundamentals of delegation. When a task or project is delegated in an unclear way, or where there is a lack of trust between the manager and the person doing the work, micromanagement naturally ensues. Clearer delegation, with a well defined goal, clear vision of the constraints and dependencies, and effective oversight, can help prevent micromanagement.&lt;ref name="Canner and Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canner|first1=Niko|last2=Bernstein|first2=Ethan|title=Why is Micromanagement So Infectious?|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=August 17, 2016|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-is-micromanagement-so-infectious|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less frequently, micromanagement is a tactic consciously chosen for the purpose of eliminating unwanted employees: A micromanager may set unreachable standards later invoked as grounds for termination of those employees. These standards may be either specific to certain employees or generally applicable but selectively enforced only against particular employees. Alternatively, the micromanager may attempt by this or other means to create a stressful workplace in which the undesired employees no longer desire to participate. When such stress is severe or pervasive enough, its creation may be regarded as [[constructive dismissal|constructive discharge]] (also known in the United Kingdom as "constructive dismissal" and in the United States as "constructive termination").

==Effects==
Regardless of a micromanager's [[Motivation|motive]] for their conduct, its potential effects include:
* Creation of ''[[ex post]]'' [[resentment]] in both ''vertical'' (manager-subordinate) and ''horizontal'' (subordinate-subordinate) relationships
* Damage to ''[[ex ante]]'' trust in both vertical and horizontal relationships
* Interference with existing [[teamwork]] and inhibition of future teamwork in both vertical relationships (''e.g.'', via [[malicious compliance]]) and horizontal relationships (''e.g.'', exploitation of [[moral hazard]] created by poorly proportioned effort-reward structures).

Because a pattern of micromanagement suggests to employees that a manager does not trust their work or judgment, it is a major factor in triggering employee disengagement, often to the point of promoting a dysfunctional and [[hostile work environment]] in which one or more managers, or even management generally, are labeled "control freaks."&lt;ref&gt;Bielaszka-DuVernay, Christina (2008). [http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hmu/2008/02/micromanage-at-your-peril.php Micromanage at Your Peril] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707150829/http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hmu/2008/02/micromanage-at-your-peril.php |date=7 July 2012 }}. ''Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation''. Retrieved on 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Disengaged employees invest time, but not effort or creativity, in the work in which they are assigned. The effects of this phenomenon are worse in situations where work is passed from one specialized employee to another.  In such a situation, apathy among upstream employees affects not only their own productivity but also that of their downstream colleagues.

Severe forms of micromanagement can completely eliminate trust, stifle opportunities for learning and development of interpersonal skills, and even provoke anti-social behavior. Micromanagers of this severity often rely on [[Culture of fear#In the workplace|inducing fear in the employees]] to achieve more control and can severely affect [[self-esteem]] of employees as well as their [[mental health|mental]] and [[physical health]]. Occasionally, and especially when their micromanagement involves the suppression of [[Criticism#Constructive criticism|constructive criticism]] that could otherwise lead to internal reform, severe micromanagers affect subordinates' mental and/or physical health to such an extreme that the subordinates' only way to change their workplace environment is to change employers or even leave the workplace despite lacking alternative job prospects (see [[constructive discharge]], ''[[Micromanagement#Causes|supra]]'').

Finally, the detrimental effects of micromanagement can extend beyond the company itself, especially when the behavior becomes severe enough to force out skilled employees valuable to competitors. Current employees may complain about micromanagement in social settings or to friend-colleagues (''e.g.'', classmates and/or former co-workers) affiliated with other firms in a field. Outside observers such as consultants, clients, interviewees, or visitors may notice the behavior and recount it in conversation with friends and/or colleagues. Most harmfully to the company, forced-out employees, especially those whose advanced skills have made them attractive to other companies and gained them immediate respect, may have few reservations about speaking frankly when answering questions about why they changed employers; they may even deliberately badmouth their former employer. The resulting damage to the company's reputation may create or increase insecurity among management, prompting further micromanagement among managers who use it to cope with insecurity; such a [[feedback]] effect creates and perpetuates a vicious cycle. It may follow the forced-out employee to the new job and create an environment of new micromanagement.

The salience of the case comes from the fact that [[Michael Hardie Boys|Justice Hardie Boys]] held the directors of a building company personally liable for damage caused by defective foundations.&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'' [1984] 2 NZLR 548 at 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been described in the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] as one that, "certainly provides some authority for the view that the directors of a building company with actual control of particular building operations owe a duty of care, associated with that control."&lt;ref&gt;''Body Corporate 202254 v Taylor'' [2009] 2 NZLR 17 at 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Between 1976 and 1977 Douglas Homes Ltd built four flats in a residential subdivision in [[Waimairi County]], [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] over the top of an old shingle pit.&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'' [1984] 2 NZLR 548 at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; Before construction, "the directors had been advised by an engineer on the work necessary for the laying of foundations for two flats. One of the directors did not ensure that the engineer’s advice was adhered to in the construction of the foundations of one flat. The other director specifically took charge of the works on the other, and failed to ensure the engineer’s advice was followed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thornton.net.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/In_Pursuit_of_the_directors.pdf|title = In pursuit of the directors|last = Thornton|first = Michael|date = 13 April 2007|journal = NZLawyer|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
Hardie Boys J reasoned that the directors of Douglas Homes Ltd could be held liable for their negligence as, "The principle of limited liability protects shareholders and not directors, and a director is as responsible for his own torts as any other servant or agent."&lt;ref&gt;''Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson'' [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardie Boys J held that in establishing whether a director owed a duty of care the test was to be that established in ''[[Anns v Merton LBC|Anns v Merton London Borough Council]]'' [1978] AC 728 and that a duty of care was founded upon the control a director exercised over the operations of a company.
 
{{Cquote|The relevance of the degree of control which a director has over the operations of the company is that it provides a test of whether or not his personal carelessness may be likely to cause damage to a third party, so that he becomes subject to a duty of care. It is not the fact that he is a director that creates the control, but rather that the fact of control, however derived, may create the duty. There is therefore no essential difference in this respect between a director and a general manager or indeed a more humble employee of the company. Each is under a duty of care, both to those with whom he deals on the company's behalf and to those with whom the company deals in so far as that dealing is subject to his control.|author=Hardie Boys J|source=''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'''&lt;ref&gt;''Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson'' [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 548.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Significance==
The ratio has not yet been overturned and as such remains a precedent for holding directors liable for defects in construction that was under their control. In 2006 in ''Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation),'' [[David Baragwanath|Justice Baragwanath]] applied the ratio of the case to hold a director personally liable for a [[Leaky homes crisis|leaky building]] constructed by his company.&lt;ref&gt;''Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation)''  HC Auckland CIV 2004-404-1065, 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 appeal from the Weathertight Homes Tribunal Justice Wylie noted the correct approach to searching for directorial liability lay through the test articulated in ''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'';

{{Cquote|...it should have asked itself whether the elements of the tort of negligence were made out against each of [the directors]. In doing so, it should have borne in mind the presumption against the imposition of personal responsibility where the director was simply acting on behalf of the company. It should have asked itself whether the director assumed personal liability for the relevant conduct. The degree of control test articulated by Hardie Boys J in Morton is likely to be of considerable help in answering that question.|author=Wylie J|source=''Chee v Stareast Investment Limited'''&lt;ref&gt;''Chee v Stareast Investment Limited'' HC Auckland CIV 2009-404-005255, 1 April 2010 at [113].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">A '''new chemical entity''' ('''NCE''') is, according to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], a [[drug]] that contains no active [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] that has been approved by the FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm118696.pdf。&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''new molecular entity''' ('''NME''') is a drug that contains an active moiety that has never been approved by the FDA or marketed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2009/09/hatchwaxman-25th-anniversary-quiz-the-answers-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
An active moiety is a [[molecule]] or [[ion]], excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an [[ester]], [[salt]] (including a salt with [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen]] or [[coordination bond]]s), or other [[noncovalent]] derivative (such as a [[Coordination complex|complex]], [[chelate]], or [[clathrate]]) of the molecule, responsible for the [[physiological]] or [[pharmacological]] action of the drug substance.

An NCE is a [[molecule]] developed by the innovator company in the early [[drug discovery]] stage, which after undergoing [[clinical trials]] could translate into a drug that could be a treatment for some disease. [[Chemical synthesis|Synthesis]] of an NCE is the first step in the process of [[drug development]]. Once the synthesis of the NCE has been completed, companies have two options before them. They can either go for clinical trials on their own or license the NCE to another company. In the latter option, companies can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of clinical trials, as the licensee company would be conducting further clinical trials and subsequently launching the drug. Companies adopting this model of business would be able to generate high margins as they get a huge one-time payment for the NCE as well as entering into a revenue sharing agreement with the licensee company.

Under the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]], all new chemical entities must first be reviewed by an advisory committee before the FDA can approve these products.

== Overview ==
[[File:Stephane Gigandet Open food facts KidEXPERIMENT @ Open World Forum Paris.JPG|thumbnail|left|Stéphane Gigandet presenting the project on October 2012 at the [[Open World Forum]].]]

The project gathers information and data on food products from around the world.&lt;ref name=whoweare /&gt;

For each item, the database stores its generic name, quantity, type of packaging, brand, category, manufacturing or processing locations, countries and stores where the product is sold, list of ingredients, any traces (for [[Food allergy|allergies]], [[dietary laws]] or any specific diet), [[food additive]]s and nutritional information.

Each contributor can add or edit food items based on the information explicitly shown on the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ile-reunion.pressecologie.com/actualite/Mieux-conna%C3%AEtre-ce-que-nous-mangeons#.UbVvQed7Lng |title=Mieux connaître ce que nous mangeons |date=3 July 2012 |website=ile-reunion.pressecologie.com |access-date=11 June 2013 |quote=Les étiquettes et autres emballages de nos aliments fourmillent d’informations : nature des produits, quantité, origine, ingrédients, à cela s’ajoutent les allergènes, les tableaux affichant la composition nutritionnelle, sans oublier les labels en tous genres, ou encore l’empreinte carbone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[barcode]] (when available) is generally used as the [[identifier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lelabo-ess.org/?Dans-l-ESS-l-ouverture-des-donnees |title=Dans l’ESS, l’ouverture des données a bien commencé : focus sur trois projets passionnants |date=8 April 2013 |website=lelabo-ess.org |access-date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile phone applications allow for capturing photos and information that are reprocessed manually by volunteers.

Due to similar mechanisms for modification, extension, or deletion of content and structure, the project is sometimes compared to [[Wikipedia]] in the media.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parfait |first=Audrey |date=2 May 2012 |title=Open Food Facts, nouveau site d'informations alimentaires |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/open-food-facts-nouveau-site-d-informations-alimentaires_1117288.html |journal=[[L'Express]] |access-date=11 June 2013 |quote=Sur le modèle de l'encyclopédie en ligne Wikipedia, Open Food Facts est fondé sur la collaboration des utilisateurs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savoirscom1.info/2013/04/26/1362/ |title=Open Food Facts, le wikipédia des aliments |website=savoirscom1.info |date=26 April 2013 |access-date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reuses ===
The data is reused by various projects on issues related to palm oil, sugar, and location of the producers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/produits-alimentaires-ingredients-nutrition-labels/ List of reuses Data.gouv.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Organic Crop Improvement Association''' ('''OCIA''') is a member-owned, [[non-profit organization]], which provides research, education and [[organic certification|certification]] services to [[organic farming|organic]] growers, processors and handlers around the world.  OCIA certifies and verifies farm, livestock, processor/handlers, broker-traders, Community Grower Groups (CGGs), and Private Labels to various programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Market Access|url=http://ocia.org/about-ocia/global-market-access|accessdate=16 November 2016}} OCIA certifies operations to the OCIA International Certification Standard, [[USDA]] [[National Organic Program]] (NOP), [[Canada Organic Regime]] (COR), European Union Equivalent Standards (EU), [[Japanese Organic Agricultural Standards]] (JAS) and [[Quebec Organic Reference Standards]] (Quebec). OCIA verifies to JAS, the US-Canada Organic Equivalence Arrangement, [[Bio Suisse]], Swiss Ordinance of Organic Farming, UTZ Certified, Smithsonian Bird Friendly and Shade-Grown Coffee (part of the OCIA International Certification Standard.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:OCIA - Certified Organic Seal.svg|right|150px|thumb|Bilingual organic certification seal.]]With its headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, OCIA has regional and chapter offices in Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua, Japan, Guatemala, Peru and the U.S.  OCIA was founded in 1985 (incorporated in Pennsylvania 1988) near [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec, by a group of farmers, modeled on the "crop improvement associations" that came out of the [[Dust Bowl]] era.  These associations started as informal meetings where farmers could discuss and ask advice about their land.  In the 1970s as the [[organic movement]] developed, "organic" crop improvement associations were formed. OCIA mandated that farmers would hold farmers to one of the first international organic standards in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCIA Family Farmer Spotlight: Bart Hall|url=http://ocia.org/news-and-events/news/ocia-family-farmer-spotlight-bart-hall|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international organization, OCIA continues to have a local approach with the organization largely being made up of local "chapters."  The organization had members primarily in Canada and the U.S. until a group of Peruvian farmers joined the organization in 1988.  Expansion throughout Latin America continued, and now OCIA has members across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OCIA|url=http://ocia.org/about-ocia|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Certification company spin offs===

OCIA grew the organic industry as new organic certification companies split off since its founding, including Global Organic Alliance, OneCert, TransCanada Organic Certification Services, and Quality Assurance International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Brandon H.|date=2010-10-01|title=Values and Standards Organizations in a Nascent Market|ssrn=2340802|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension in China===

OCIA was suspended from operating in China in 2010 for one year by the USDA after it reportedly used employees of a Chinese government agency to inspect state-controlled farms and food processing facilities, which constituted a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA/OCIA agree to pull organic certification authority in China|url=https://brownfieldagnews.com/news/usdaocia-agree-to-pull-organic-certification-authority-in-china/|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, OCIA had joined forces with the Organic Food Development Corporation, an agency affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. The association kept a small staff — one or three people in Nanjing — while inspectors from the Chinese agency went out to farms and factories. Their findings were translated into English and sent to OCIA headquarters in Nebraska, where staff members reviewed the material and made the final decisions on certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Drops Inspector of Food in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/business/global/14organic.html|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PEST analysis''' (political, economic, socio-cultural and technological) describes a framework of macro-environmental factors used in the [[environmental scanning]] component of [[strategic management]]. It is part of an external analysis when conducting a strategic analysis or doing [[market research]], and gives an overview of the different macro-environmental factors to be taken into consideration. It is a  strategic tool for understanding market growth or decline, business position, potential and direction for operations. 

Variants that build on the PEST framework include:
* '''PESTEL''' or '''PESTLE''', which adds legal and environmental factors. Popular in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/subjects/corpstrtgy/general/pestle-analysis.htm PESTLE analysis history and application], CIPD. Retrieved 2009-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''SLEPT''', adding legal factors.
* '''STEPE''', adding ecological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/jrichardson/STEPE.htm A Brief Intellectual History of the STEPE Model or Framework (i.e., the Social, Technical, Economic, Political, and Ecological)], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''STEEPLE''' and '''STEEPLED''', adding ethics and demographic factors.
* '''DESTEP''', adding demographic and ecological factors.
* '''SPELIT''', adding legal and intercultural factors. Popular in the United States since the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Spelit-Power-Matrix-Organizational-Environment/dp/141967191X/], SPELIT Power Matrix. Retrieved 2015-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also '''STEER''', which considers sociocultural, technological, economic, ecological, and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]] factors, but does not specifically include political factors.&lt;ref name="CarrJr.2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence P. Carr|author2=Alfred J. Nanni Jr.|title=Delivering Results: Managing What Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxE5rnqJq4cC&amp;pg=PA44|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0621-2|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The basic PEST analysis includes four factors:
* '''Political''' factors are basically how the [[government]] intervenes in the economy. Specifically, political factors have areas including [[tax policy]], [[labour law]], [[environmental law]], [[trade restriction]]s, [[tariffs]], and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided ([[merit good]]s) and those that the government does not want to be provided ([[demerit good]]s or merit bads). Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the [[health]], [[education]], and [[infrastructure]] of a nation.
* '''Economic''' factors include [[economic growth]], [[interest rate]]s, [[exchange rate]]s,  [[inflation rate]]. These factors greatly affect how businesses operate and make decisions. For example, interest rates affect a firm's [[cost of capital]] and therefore to what extent a business grows and expands. Exchange rates can affect the costs of exporting goods and the supply and price of imported goods in an economy.
* '''Social''' factors include the cultural aspects and health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. High trends in social factors affect the demand for a company's products and how that company operates. For example, the ageing population may imply a smaller and less-willing workforce (thus increasing the cost of labour). Furthermore, companies may change various management strategies to adapt to social trends caused from this (such as recruiting older workers).
* '''Technological''' factors include technological aspects like [[R&amp;D]] activity, [[automation]], technology incentives and the rate of [[technological change]]. These can determine [[barrier to entry|barriers to entry]], minimum efficient production level and influence the [[outsourcing]] decisions. Furthermore, technological shifts would affect costs, quality, and lead to [[innovation]].

Expanding the analysis to PESTLE or PESTEL adds:

* '''Legal''' factors include [[discrimination law]], [[consumer law]], [[antitrust law]], [[employment law]], and [[health and safety law]]. These factors can affect how a company operates, its costs, and the demand for its products.
* '''Environmental''' factors include ecological and environmental aspects such as weather, climate, and [[climate change]], which may especially affect industries such as tourism, farming, and insurance. Furthermore, growing awareness of the potential impacts of climate change is affecting how companies operate and the products they offer, both creating new markets and diminishing or destroying existing ones.

Other factors for the various offshoots include:

* '''Demographic''' factors include gender, age, ethnicity, knowledge of languages, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, religious belief or practice, culture and tradition, living standards and income level.
* '''Regulatory''' factors include acts of parliament and associated regulations, international and national standards, local government by-laws, and mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with these.

More factors discussed in the SPELIT Power Matrix include:

* '''Inter-cultural''' factors considers collaboration in a global setting.
* Other specialized factors discussed in chapter 10 of the SPELIT Power Matrix include the '''Ethical, Educational, Physical, Religious, and Security''' environments. The security environment may include either personal, company, or national security.
* Other business-related factors that might be considered in an environmental analysis include '''Competition, Demographics, Ecological, Geographical, Historical, Organizational, and Temporal (schedule).'''&lt;ref&gt;Schmieder-Ramirez, J. and Mallette, L.,  [http://insciencepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ISP_Education-Applications-Developments-Book.pdf Using the SPELIT Analysis Technique for Organizational Transitions], Chapter 28 of "Education Applications and Developments" edited by Mafalda Carmo, Science Press, 2015 Retrieved 2015-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability of the factors ==
The model's factors will vary in importance to a given company based on its industry and the goods it produces. For example, consumer and [[Business-to-business|B2B]] companies tend to be more affected by the social factors, while a global defense contractor would tend to be more affected by political factors. Additionally, factors that are more likely to change in the future or more relevant to a given company will carry greater importance. For example, a company which has borrowed heavily will need to focus more on the economic factors (especially interest rates).

Furthermore, conglomerate companies who produce a wide range of products (such as Sony, Disney, or BP) may find it more useful to analyze one department of its company at a time with the PESTEL model, thus focusing on the specific factors relevant to that one department. A company may also wish to divide factors into geographical relevance, such as local, national, and global.

== Use of PEST analysis with other models ==
The PEST factors, combined with external micro-environmental factors and internal drivers, can be classified as opportunities and threats in a [[SWOT analysis]]. A graphical method for PEST analysis called "PESTLEWeb" was developed at [[Henley Business School]] in the UK; research showed that PESTLEWeb diagrams are considered by users to be more logical, rational, and convincing than traditional PEST analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Rob|title=A Graphical Method for Exploring the Business Environment|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~kell0956/docs/PESTLEWeb.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Rob|title=Is there a better way to analyse the business environment?|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~kell0956/docs/pestleweb_thesis.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blashki-Hannah-and-Phillip.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Phillip and Hannah Blashki, 1892]]
'''Phillip Blashki''' (21 February 1837 – 21 October 1916) was a Polish immigrant to Australia who rose to be a successful businessman,&lt;ref name=Rutland&gt;{{cite book | last = Rutland | first = Suzanne | title = The Jews in Australia | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-521-61285-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; magistrate, [[Justice of the peace|JP]], holder of many positions of public responsibility and associated with numerous community and charitable events in [[Melbourne]].

==Youth==
Phillip was born Favel Wagczewski in [[Błaszki]], a Polish village near [[Kalisz]], on 21 February 1837. 

After working as a tassell-maker in Manchester he married a young Polish widow, Hannah Potash, and arrived in [[Melbourne]] on the masted ship called the 'Alice Walton' on 1 April 1858. At that time Melbourne was experiencing huge population growth due to the gold rush. See [[History of Melbourne]]. 

Phillip Blashki's life was summarised on the center front page of [[Herald Sun|The Herald]], which read in part, "For 39 years, he was a [[justice of the peace]], and for a lengthy period he was chairman of the City Court Bench... 58 years ago he came to Victoria, and took a leading part in many public affairs. He founded the Melbourne Jewish Aid Society, was a trustee of the [[Brighton Cemetery]], and a prominent Freemason. He was also one of the founders of the Charity Organisation Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Justice for 39 Years, Mr Phillip Blashki Dies | publisher = The Herald Newspaper | date = 21 October 1916 | location = Melbourne | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillip and Hannah had 14 children and now over 500 descendants, mostly in Australia, have been documented.&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammer | first = Gael | title = Phillip Blashki – A Victorian Patriarch | publisher = P. Blashki and Sons Pty Ltd | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-9589451-0-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Phillip was primarily a silversmith and had a stall at Melbourne's [[Great Exhibition]] of 1888. He was also an optician, watch repairer, jeweller and maker of masonic regalia.&lt;ref name=Jupp&gt;{{cite book | last = Jupp| first = James| title = The Australian People | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-521-80789-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced several notable items of public importance, including Australian cricket's [[Sheffield Shield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harte | first = Chris | title = A History of the Sheffield Shield | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 1987 | pages = 32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of which was donated by Lord Sheffield in 1893, following his tour (led by W G Grace) of Australia of 1891-2. Blashki's tender was the one accepted. He also produced the NSW Cricketers Association's 'Hordern Shield'.

[[File:Blashki-opening-of-City-Court.jpg|thumb|right|310px|Opening of City Court, Russell Street, Melbourne, 20 January 1914, with inset showing presence of Phillip Blashki]]
Phillip Blashki started in Geelong as a hawker&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = News | publisher = The Argus | date = 31 October 1868 | location = Melbourne | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and retailer of goods during the [[gold rush]]. In 1868, following a bankrupting theft, he moved to Melbourne with his then 11 children. Around 1875 he opened his city store in Bourke Street Melbourne and grew it into a thriving business making jewellery, Masonic [[regalia]] and significant ceremonial medals and chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/themes/2352/p-blashki-sons-melbourne-victoria |title=P. Blashki &amp; Sons, Melbourne, Victoria |publisher=Museum Victoria |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sons took over the business, 'P. Blashki and Sons', in 1893 which still continues today. Other sons went into the tobacco industry and Phillip and his sons applied for many label trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Application for Registration of One Trade-Mark (No 404) | publisher = Victorian Government Gazette | issue = 77 | date = 22 July 1881 | page = 2152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family made the first cigarettes as a way to make smoking affordable for the masses.

Phillip Blashki was a [[Justice of the peace]] for nearly 40 years and was actively involved in the Victorian judicial system. He was appointed a Magistrate in March 1911 in addition to being a JP for the entire state of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Law Department, Solicitor-General | publisher = Victorian Government Gazette | issue = 46 | date = 29 March 1911 | page = 1779 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1914, he was one of Lord Mayor Hennesey's invited dignitaries at the opening of the Melbourne City Court at Russell St. and was appointed the first Chairman of the City Court Bench (which became the [[Melbourne Magistrates Court]]). As recognition for his work as a J.P., philanthropist and community leader, Blashki was one of the invited guests at the opening of the first federal parliament at the Exhibition Buildings.

Blashki was a council member of the Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Chamber of Manufacturers | publisher = The Argus | date = 12 October 1886 | location = Melbourne | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was instrumental in founding and/or the early development of a number of communal and charitable organisations (including the provision of seed funding in some instances). Whilst still working in Geelong in the 1860s he was active on the new Stephen St. Melbourne branch of the Jewish Philanthropic Society (est.1848). He co-founded the Melbourne Jewish Aid Society in 1888, the Melbourne Cemetery Trust and esteemed president of the Melbourne Freemason's Homes.

==Community work==
[[File:Blashki-jewish-aid.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Illuminated Address for Phillip Blashki presented by the Jewish Aid Society, 1907]]
The name Phiilip Blashki is synonymous with the history of [[Freemasonry]] in Victoria. Blashki held various offices in several Lodges over a period of 40+ years and was appointed District Grand Warden under the British Constitution.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{citation | last = Phillips | first = Worshipful Brother M. G. | title = Opening of the Freemasons Hall, Fitzroy | publisher = Lord Carrington Lodge No 111 V.C. | year = 1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillip Blashki was the first Trustee for the Jewish section of [[Brighton Cemetery]]. He established the Tahara house for Jewish burials and set a precedent for purchasing half sized graves for children. In 1909 he co-founded the [[Bereavement in Judaism|Jewish Burial]] Society (Chevra Kadisha)&lt;ref name=Aron /&gt; to cater for Eastern European immigrants, but available for all Jews today.

He was a J.P. for all the bailiwicks of Melbourne and an assessor and Hon. magistrate in Gipps Ward. His success is what led the [[Attorney General]] of Victoria to appoint him as Chairman of the new City Court Bench. Decades after the Corio Bay drowning of his wife Hannah's son Hyman, a good swimmer, his position as Magistrate enabled him to order that the [[Melbourne City Baths]] Corporation Swimming Pool would be open free for all children to learn to swim.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

The success of the Jewish Aid Society, for which he received the illuminated address pictured, led to the Victorian government establishing a Charity Organisation Society&lt;ref name=personal /&gt; with similar objectives and he remained on their committee for many years. On his 70th birthday another illuminated address signed by thirty solicitors practising in the Russell St.court, was handed to him by the then Prime Minister, [[Alfred Deakin]].

Blashki was particularly interested in advancing Jewish education.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Kendall | title = Philip Evergood | publisher = Associated University Presses | location = NJ, USA | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-8387-5111-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first president of the Board of the East Melbourne Hebrew School. This became the United Jewish Education Board, with Victorian [[Attorney General]] [[Isaac Isaacs]] as its president and Phillip Blashki as its treasurer&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Lazarus | title = The Jews in Victoria in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = Excelsior Printing Works Pty Ltd | location = Melbourne | year = 1954 | pages = 392–395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeding president.&lt;ref name=Aron&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Joseph | last1 = Aron | first2 = Judy | last2 = Arndt | title = The Enduring Remnant | publisher = Melbourne University Press | location = Melbourne | year = 1992 | pages = 296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted as chairman to the Board of Advice to the Victorian Education Department for the East Melbourne District.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

Blashki was a foundation member and a term vice-president of the Victorian Employer's Federation,&lt;ref name=personal&gt;{{citation | title = Personal | publisher = The Argus | date = 23 October 1916 | location = Melbourne | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; co-founded the Jewish Herald Association and was on the board of the Benevolent Asylum and the Montefiore Homes.

&lt;!-- {{Merge from|Real Options Analysis|Talk:Real Options Analysis#Merge proposal|date=March 2009}} Should merge all this into [[Real Options Valuation]] --&gt;
'''Real options valuation''', also often termed '''real options analysis''',&lt;ref name="Borison"&gt;Adam Borison ([[Stanford University]]). [http://ardent.mit.edu/real_options/RO_current_lectures/borison.pdf ''Real Options Analysis: Where are the Emperor's Clothes?''].
&lt;/ref&gt; ('''ROV''' or '''ROA''') applies [[option (finance)|option]] [[Valuation of options|valuation techniques]] to [[capital budgeting]] decisions.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Campbell, R. Harvey. [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA456_2002/Identifying_real_options.htm ''Identifying real options''], Duke University, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''real option''' itself, is the right—but not the obligation—to undertake certain business initiatives, such as deferring, abandoning, expanding, staging, or contracting a capital investment project. For example, the opportunity to invest in the expansion of a firm's factory, or alternatively to sell the factory, is a real [[call option|call]] or [[put option]], respectively.

Real options are generally distinguished from conventional financial options in that they are not typically traded as securities, and do not usually involve decisions on an underlying asset that is traded as a financial security.&lt;ref&gt;Amram, M., and K. N. Howe (2003), [http://www.csn.ul.ie/~karen/Articles/Real%20Options.pdf Real Options Valuations: Taking Out the Rocket Science], Strategic Finance, Feb. 2003, 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; A further distinction is that option holders here, i.e. management, can directly influence the value of the option's [[underlying]] project; whereas this is not a consideration as regards the underlying security of a financial option. Moreover, management can not lookup for a [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] as uncertainty, instead their perceived uncertainty matters in real options reasonings. Unlike financial options, management also have to create or discover real options, and such creation and discovery process comprises an entrepreneurial or business task. Real options are most valuable when uncertainty is high; management has significant flexibility to change the course of the project in a favourable direction and is willing to exercise the options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Boarin|first2=Sara|last3=Pellegrino|first3=Francesco|last4=Ricotti|first4=Marco E.|date=2015-02-01|title=Load following with Small Modular Reactors (SMR): A real options analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421401295X|journal=Energy|volume=80|pages=41–54|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real options analysis, as a discipline, extends from its application in [[corporate finance]], to [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision making under uncertainty]] in general, adapting the techniques developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]] to "real-life" decisions. For example, [[R&amp;D]] managers can use Real Options Valuation to help them allocate their R&amp;D budget among diverse projects; a non business example might be the decision to join the work force, or rather, to forgo several years of income to attend [[graduate school]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bilkic et. al. under [[#Applications]].&lt;/ref&gt;  It, thus, forces decision makers to be explicit about the assumptions underlying their projections, and for this reason ROV is increasingly employed as a tool in [[business strategy]] formulation.&lt;ref name = "Pettit"&gt;Justin Pettit: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/opt3.pdf ''Applications in Real Options and Value-based Strategy'']; Ch.4. in Trigeorgis (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sammer"&gt;Joanne Sammer: [http://businessfinancemag.com/print/5564 Thinking in Real (Options) Time], businessfinancemag.com&lt;/ref&gt; This extension of real options to real-world projects often requires customized [[decision support system]]s, because otherwise the complex compound real options will become too intractable to handle.&lt;ref name = "Zhang &amp; Babovic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=S.X. |last2=Babovic |first2=V. |year=2011 |title=An evolutionary real options framework for the design and management of projects and systems with complex real options and exercising conditions |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=119–129 |doi= 10.1016/j.dss.2010.12.001|ssrn= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220197192_An_evolutionary_real_options_framework_for_the_design_and_management_of_projects_and_systems_with_complex_real_options_and_exercising_conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of real option==
{| style="float: right;" border="1" width="400"
|- valign="top"
|+Simple Examples
|'''Investment''' &lt;br /&gt;
This simple example shows the relevance of the real option to delay investment and wait for further information, and is adapted from {{cite web | title=Investment Example| url=http://www.watsonandnoble.com/#!investment-example/c1vmv }}.

Consider a firm that has the option to invest in a new factory. It can invest this year or next year. The question is: when should the firm invest? If the firm invests this year, it has an income stream earlier. But, if it invests next year, the firm obtains further information about the state of the economy, which can prevent it from investing with losses.

The firm knows its [[discounted cash flows]] if it invests this year: 5M. If it invests next year, the discounted cash flows are 6M with a 66.7% probability, and 3M€ with a 33.3% probability. Assuming a risk neutral rate of 10%, future [[discounted cash flows]] are, in present terms, 5.45M and 2.73M, respectively. The investment cost is 4M. If the firm invests next year, the present value of the investment cost is 3.63M.

Following the [[net present value]] rule for investment, the firm should invest this year because the [[discounted cash flows]] (5M) are greater than the investment costs (4M) by 1M. Yet, if the firm waits for next year, it only invests if discounted cash flows do not decrease. If discounted cash flows decrease to 3M€, then investment is no longer profitable. If, they grow to 6M, then the firm invests. This implies that the firm invests next year with a 66.7% probability and earns 5.45M - 3.63M if it does invest. Thus the value to invest next year is 1.21M. Given that the value to invest next year exceeds the value to invest this year, the firm should wait for further information to prevent losses. This simple example shows how '''the [[net present value]] may lead the firm to take unnecessary risk, which could be prevented by real options valuation.''' &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Staged Investment''' &lt;br /&gt;
Staged investments are quite often in the pharmaceutical, mineral, and oil industries. In this example, it is studied a staged investment abroad in which a firm decides whether to open one or two stores in a foreign country. This is adapted from {{cite web | title= Staged Investment Example| url=http://www.watsonandnoble.com/#!staged-investment-example/c1ol4 }}.

The firm does not know how well its stores are accepted in a foreign country. If their stores have high demand, the [[discounted cash flows]] per store is 10M. If their stores have low demand, the [[discounted cash flows]] per store is 5M. Assuming that the probability of both events is 50%, the expected [[discounted cash flows]] per store is 7.5M. It is also known that if the store's demand is independent of the store: if one store has high demand, the other also has high demand. The risk neutral rate is 10%. The investment cost per store is 8M.

Should the firm invest in one store, two stores, or not invest? The [[net present value]] suggests the firm should not invest: the net present value is -0.5M per store. But is it the best alternative? Following real options valuation, it is not: the firm has the real option to open one store this year, wait a year to know its demand, and invest in the new store next year if demand is high.

By opening one store, the firm knows that the probability of high demand is 50%. The potential value gain to expand next year is thus  50%*(10M-8M)/1.1 = 0.91M. The value to open one store this year is 7.5M - 8M = -0.5. Thus the value of the real option to invest in one store, wait a year, and invest next year is 0.41M. Given this, the firm should opt by opening one store. This simple example shows that a '''negative [[net present value]] does not imply that the firm should not invest.'''

The flexibility available to management&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the actual "real options"&amp;nbsp;– generically, will relate to project size, project timing, and the operation of the project once established.&lt;ref&gt;This section draws primarily on Campbell R. Harvey: [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA456_2002/Identifying_real_options.htm Identifying Real Options].&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, any (non-recoverable) upfront expenditure related to this flexibility is the [[option premium]].  Real options are also commonly applied to [[stock valuation]] - see [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|Business valuation #Option pricing approaches]] - as well as to various other [[#Further reading|"Applications" referenced below]].

===Options relating to project size===
Where the project's scope is uncertain, flexibility as to the size of the relevant facilities is valuable, and constitutes optionality.&lt;ref&gt;This sub-section is additionally based on [[Aswath Damodaran]]: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optexpand.pdf  The Option to Expand and Abandon].&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Option to expand''': Here the project is built with capacity in excess of the expected level of output so that it can produce at higher rate if needed. Management then has the option (but not the obligation) to expand&amp;nbsp;– i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise the option]]&amp;nbsp;– should conditions turn out to be favourable. A project with the option to expand will cost more to establish, the excess being the [[option premium]], but is worth more than the same without the possibility of expansion. This is equivalent to a [[call option]].
*'''Option to contract ''': The project is engineered such that output can be contracted in future should conditions turn out to be unfavourable. Forgoing these future expenditures constitutes [[Exercise (options)|option exercise]]. This is the equivalent to a [[put option]], and again, the excess upfront expenditure is the [[option premium]].
*'''Option to expand or contract''': Here the project is designed such that its operation can be dynamically turned on and off. Management may shut down part or all of the operation when conditions are unfavourable (a put option), and may restart operations when conditions improve (a call option).  A [[flexible manufacturing system]] (FMS) is a good example of this type of option. This option is also known as a '''[[Switching option]]'''.

===Options relating to project life and timing===
Where there is uncertainty as to when, and how, business or other conditions will eventuate, flexibility as to the timing of the relevant project(s) is valuable, and constitutes optionality. '''Growth options''' are perhaps the most generic in this category&amp;nbsp;– these entail the option to exercise only those projects that appear to be profitable at the time of initiation.

*'''Initiation or deferment options''': Here management has flexibility as to when to start a project. For example, in [[natural resource]] exploration a firm can delay mining a deposit until market conditions are favorable. This constitutes an [[American option|American styled]] [[call option]].
*'''Option to abandon''': Management may have the option to cease a project during its life, and, possibly, to realise its [[salvage value]]. Here, when the present value of the remaining cash flows falls below the liquidation value, the asset may be sold, and this act is effectively the exercising of a [[put option]]. This option is also known as a '''[[Termination option]]'''. Abandonment options are [[American option|American styled]].
*'''Sequencing options''': This option is related to the initiation option above, although entails flexibility as to the timing of more than one inter-related projects: the analysis here is as to whether it is advantageous to implement these [[sequentially]] or [[in parallel]].  Here, observing the outcomes relating to the first project, the firm can resolve some of the uncertainty relating to the venture overall. Once resolved, management has the option to proceed or not with the development of the other projects. If taken in parallel, management would have already spent the resources and the value of the option not to spend them is lost. The sequencing of projects is an important issue in [[corporate strategy]]. Related here is also the notion of  Intraproject vs. Interproject options.

===Options relating to project operation===
Management may have flexibility relating to the product produced and /or the [[production management|process used in manufacture]].  This flexibility constitutes optionality.

*'''Output mix options''': The option to produce different outputs from the same facility is known as an output mix option or '''product flexibility'''. These options are particularly valuable in industries where demand is volatile or where quantities demanded in total for a particular good are typically low, and management would wish to change to a different product quickly if required.
*'''Input mix options''': An input mix option&amp;nbsp;– '''process flexibility'''&amp;nbsp;– allows management to use different inputs to produce the same output as appropriate.  For example, a farmer will value the option to switch between various feed sources, preferring to use the cheapest acceptable alternative.  An [[electric utility]], for example, may have the option to switch between various fuel sources to produce electricity, and therefore a flexible plant, although more expensive may actually be more valuable.
*'''Operating scale options''': Management may have the option to change the output rate per unit of time or to change the total length of production run time, for example in response to market conditions. These options are also known as '''[[Intensity option]]s'''.

==Valuation==
Given the above, it is clear that there is an [[analogy]] between real options and [[option (finance)|financial options]],&lt;ref name="Luehrman"/&gt; and we would therefore expect options-based modelling and analysis to be applied here. At the same time, it is nevertheless important to understand why the more standard valuation techniques may not be applicable for ROV.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

===Applicability of standard techniques===
ROV is often contrasted with more standard techniques of [[capital budgeting]], such as [[discounted cash flow]] (DCF) analysis / [[net present value]] (NPV).&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;  Under this "standard" NPV approach, future expected cash flows are [[present value]]d under the  [[Mathematical finance#Risk and portfolio management: the P world|empirical probability measure]] at a discount rate that reflects the embedded risk in the project; see [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]], [[Arbitrage pricing theory|APT]], [[Weighted average cost of capital|WACC]]. Here, only the expected cash flows  are considered, and the "flexibility" to alter corporate strategy in view of actual market realizations is "ignored"; see [[Real options valuation#Organizational considerations|below]] as well as [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|Valuing flexibility]] under [[Corporate finance]]. The NPV framework (implicitly) assumes that management is "passive" with regard to their [[Capital Investment]] once committed. Some analysts account for this uncertainty by adjusting the discount rate, e.g. by increasing the [[cost of capital]], or the cash flows, e.g. using [[certainty equivalent]]s, or applying (subjective) "haircuts" to the forecast numbers, or via probability-weighting as in [[rNPV]].&lt;ref name="Damodaran2"&gt;Aswath Damodaran: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/valrisk/ch5.pdf Risk Adjusted Value]; Ch 5 in ''Strategic Risk Taking: A Framework for Risk Management''. [[Wharton School Publishing]], 2007. {{ISBN|0-13-199048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SiegelShim1997"&gt;See: §32 "Certainty Equivalent Approach" &amp; §165 "Risk Adjusted Discount Rate" in: {{cite book|author1=Joel G. Siegel|author2=Jae K. Shim|author3=Stephen Hartman|title=Schaum's quick guide to business formulas: 201 decision-making tools for business, finance, and accounting students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JpojQPk8YsC|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=1 November 1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-058031-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damodaran3"&gt;Aswath Damodaran:  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when employed, however, these latter methods do not normally properly account for changes in risk over the project's lifecycle and hence fail to appropriately adapt the risk adjustment.&lt;ref name="Latimore"&gt;Dan Latimore: [http://www-935.ibm.com/services/uk/igs/pdf/esr-calculating-value-during-uncertainty.pdf ''Calculating value during uncertainty'']. [[Institute for Business Value|IBM Institute for Business Value]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This is because net present value, which is still the most frequently used technique to date, can only model responding to uncertainty by using precommitted management decisions to mutually exclusive scenarios, and then equating total project value to the scenario specified. --&gt;

By contrast, ROV assumes that management is "active" and can "continuously" respond to market changes. Real options consider each and every scenario and indicate the best corporate action in any of these contingent events.&lt;ref name="TrigeorgisBroschSmit"/&gt; Because management adapts to each negative outcome by decreasing its exposure and to positive scenarios by scaling up, the firm benefits from uncertainty in the underlying market, achieving a lower variability of profits than under the commitment/NPV stance. The contingent nature of future profits in real option models is captured by employing the techniques developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]] in the literature on [[Outline of finance#Contingent claim valuation|contingent claims analysis]]. Here the approach, known as risk-neutral valuation, consists in [[Mathematical finance#Derivatives pricing: the Q world|adjusting the probability distribution for risk consideration]], while discounting at the risk-free rate.  This technique is also known as the certainty-equivalent or martingale approach, and uses a [[risk-neutral measure]]. For technical considerations here, see [[Real options analysis#Technical considerations|below]].

Given these different treatments, the real options value of a project is typically higher than the NPV&amp;nbsp;– and the difference will be most marked in projects with major flexibility, contingency, and volatility.&lt;ref name="Mauboussin"/&gt; (As for [[option (finance)|financial options]] higher [[Volatility (finance)|volatility of the underlying]] leads to higher value). An application of Real Options Valuation in the Philippine banking industry exhibited that increased levels of income volatility may adversely affect option values on the loan portfolio, when the presence of information asymmetry is considered. In this case, increased volatility may limit the value of an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Jackson J.|last2=Trinidad|first2=Fernando L.|date=2018-02-15|title=A real options model for loan portfolios of actively traded Philippine universal banks|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s40497-018-0091-9|journal=Journal of Global Entrepreneurship Research|volume=8|pages=4|doi=10.1186/s40497-018-0091-9|issn=2251-7316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Remarks about the consequence of input quality apply to all models; Remarks about controversy are without reference. --&gt;

===Options based valuation===
Although there is much similarity between the modelling of real options and [[option (finance)|financial options]],&lt;ref name="Luehrman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Copeland | first1 = T. | last2 = Tufano | first2 = P. | year = 2004 | title = A Real-World Way to Manage Real Options | url = http://hbr.org/2004/03/a-real-world-way-to-manage-real-options/ar/1 | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 82 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ROV is distinguished from the latter, in that it takes into account uncertainty about the future evolution of the parameters that determine the value of the project, ''coupled with'' management's ability to respond to the evolution of these parameters.&lt;ref name="PiessevdPutte"&gt;Jenifer Piesse and Alexander Van de Putte. (2004). [http://www.financialcertified.com/article12.pdf "Volatility estimation in Real Options"]. 8th [[Annual International Conference on Real Options]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damodaran"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Damodaran |first= Aswath |authorlink=Aswath Damodaran |title= The Promise and Peril of Real Options |journal=NYU Working Paper |volume= |issue= S-DRP-05-02|year= 2005|pages= |url=http://stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/realopt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the combined effect of these that makes ROV technically more challenging than its alternatives.
{{cquote|First, you must figure out the full range of possible values for the underlying asset.... This involves estimating what the asset's value would be if it existed today and forecasting to see the full set of possible future values... [These] calculations provide you with numbers for all the possible future values of the option at the various points where a decision is needed on whether to continue with the project...&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"/&gt; }}
When valuing the real option, the analyst must therefore consider the inputs to the valuation, the valuation method employed, and whether any technical limitations may apply. Conceptually, valuing a real option looks at the premium between inflows and outlays for a particular project. Inputs to the value of a real option (time, discount rates, volatility, cash inflows and outflows) are each affected by the terms of business, and external environmental factors that a project exists in. Terms of business as information regarding ownership, data collection costs, and patents, are formed in relation to political, environmental, socio-cultural, technological, environmental and legal factors that affect an industry. Just as terms of business are affected by external environmental factors, these same circumstances affect the volatility of returns, as well as the discount rate (as firm or project specific risk). Furthermore, the external environmental influences that affect an industry affect projections on expected inflows and outlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Jackson J.|date=2018-01-01|title=Interfaces for enterprise valuation from a real options lens|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsc.2181/abstract|journal=Strategic Change|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=69–80|doi=10.1002/jsc.2181|issn=1099-1697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Valuation inputs====
Given the similarity in valuation approach, the inputs required for modelling the real option correspond, generically, to those required for a financial option valuation.&lt;ref name="Luehrman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PiessevdPutte"/&gt; The specific application, though, is as follows:

* The option's [[underlying]] is the project in question&amp;nbsp;– it is modelled in terms of:
** [[Spot price]]: the starting or current [[Valuation (finance)|value]] of the project is required: this is usually based on management's "best guess" as to the gross value of the project's [[cash flow]]s and resultant [[net present value|NPV]];
** [[volatility (finance)|Volatility]]: a measure for uncertainty as to the change in value over time is required:
*** the volatility in project value is generally used, usually derived via [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|monte carlo simulation]];&lt;ref name="PiessevdPutte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Barry|last2=Charnes|first2=John|date=2004|title=Real Options Volatility Estimation with Correlated Inputs|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WsQ59lXuXswJSWQwH8WkwHF3avRmkaP0/view?usp=sharing|journal=The Engineering Economist|publisher=|volume=49|issue=2|pages=|doi=|accessdate=30 January 2014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes the volatility of the first period's cash flows are preferred;&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; see [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|further]] under [[Corporate finance]] for a discussion relating to the estimation of NPV and project volatility.
*** some analysts substitute a [[Security (finance)#Listing and OTC dealing|listed security]] as a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy]], using either its price volatility ([[historical volatility]]), or, if options exist on this security, their [[implied volatility]].&lt;ref name="Borison"/&gt;
**[[Dividend]]s generated by the underlying asset: As part of a project, the dividend equates to any income which could be derived from real assets and paid to the owner. These reduce the appreciation of the asset.
* Option characteristics:
** [[Strike price]]: this corresponds to any (non-recoverable) investment outlays, typically the prospective costs of the project. In general, management would proceed (i.e. the option would be [[in the money]]) given that the [[present value]] of expected cash flows exceeds this amount;
** [[Expiration (options)|Option term]]: the time during which management may decide to act, or not act, corresponds to the life of the option. As above, examples include the time to expiry of a [[patent]], or of the [[mineral rights]] for a new mine. See [[Option time value]]. Note though that given the flexibility related to timing [[Real options valuation#Options relating to project life and timing|as described]], caution must be applied here.
** [[Option style]] and [[Exercise (options)|option exercise]]. Management's ability to respond to changes in value is modeled at each decision point as a series of options, as above these may comprise, i.a.:
*** the [[option to contract]] the project (an [[American option|American styled]] [[put option]]);
*** the [[option to abandon]] the project (also an American put);
*** the [[option to expand]] or extend the project (both [[American option|American styled]] [[call option]]s);
*** [[switching option]]s or [[composite option]]s  which may also apply to the project.

====Valuation methods====
The valuation methods usually employed, likewise, are adapted from techniques developed for [[Valuation of options|valuing financial options]].&lt;ref name = "Cortazar"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cortazar|first=Gonzalo|title=Simulation and Numerical Methods in Real Options Valuation|journal= EFMA 2000 Athens |volume= |issue= |year=2000 |pages= |ssrn=251653}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gilbert"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gilbert |first=E   |title=An Introduction to Real Options|journal=[[Investment Analysts Journal]] |volume=60 |issue= |year=2004 |pages=49–52 |url=http://www.iassa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/No602004Gilbert.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note though that, in general, while most "real" problems allow for [[American option|American style]] exercise at any point (many points) in the project's life and are impacted by multiple underlying variables, the standard methods are limited either with regard to dimensionality, to early exercise, or to both.  In selecting a model, therefore, analysts must make a [[trade off]] between these considerations; see [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|Option (finance) #Model implementation]]. The model must also be flexible enough to allow for the relevant decision rule to be coded appropriately at each decision point.

* [[Closed-form expression|Closed form]], [[Black–Scholes]]-like solutions are sometimes employed.&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; These are applicable only for [[European option|European styled]] options or perpetual American options. Note that this application of Black–Scholes assumes constant — i.e. [[deterministic]] — costs: in cases where the project's costs, like its revenue, are also assumed stochastic, then [[Margrabe's formula]] can (should) be applied instead,&lt;ref&gt;See pg 26 in Marion A. Brach (2003). ''Real Options in Practice''. Wiley. {{ISBN|0471445568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reilly &amp; Brown"&gt;See Ch. 23, Sec. 5, in: Frank Reilly, Keith Brown (2011). "Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management." (10th Edition). South-Western College Pub. {{ISBN|0538482389}}&lt;/ref&gt; here valuing the option to "exchange" expenses for revenue.  (Relatedly, where the project is exposed to two (or more) uncertainties — e.g. for natural resources, price and quantity — some analysts attempt to use an overall volatility; this, though, is more correctly treated as a [[rainbow option]],&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; typically valued using simulation as below.)
* The most commonly employed methods are [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial lattices]].&lt;ref name="Mauboussin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gilbert"/&gt; These are more widely used given that most real options are [[American option|American styled]]. Additionally, and particularly, [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice-based models]] allow for flexibility as to exercise, where the relevant, and differing, rules may be encoded at each node.&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"/&gt; Note that lattices cannot readily handle high-dimensional problems; treating the project's costs as stochastic would add (at least) one dimension to the lattice, increasing the number of ending-nodes [[Exponentiation|by the square]] (the exponent here, corresponding to the number of sources of uncertainty).
* [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|Specialised Monte Carlo Methods]] have also been developed and are increasingly, and especially,  applied to [[High-dimensional space|high-dimensional]] problems.&lt;ref name="Dias"&gt;Marco Dias. [http://www.puc-rio.br/marco.ind/monte-carlo.html ''Real Options with Monte Carlo Simulation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318060412/http://www.puc-rio.br/marco.ind/monte-carlo.html |date=2010-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that for American styled real options, this application is somewhat more complex; although recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cortazar|first=Gonzalo  |last2=Gravet|first2=Miguel |last3=Urzua|first3=Jorge |title=The valuation of multidimensional American real options using the LSM simulation method|journal=Computers &amp; Operations Research|volume=35 |issue= |year=2008 |pages=113–129 |url=http://www.gonzalocortazar.com/CortazarGravetUrzua2008.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.cor.2006.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; combines a [[least squares]] approach with simulation, allowing for the valuation of real options which are both multidimensional and American styled; see [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing#Least Square Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo methods for option pricing #Least Square Monte Carlo]].
* When the Real Option can be modelled using a [[partial differential equation]], then [[Finite difference methods for option pricing]] are sometimes applied. Although many of the early ROV articles discussed this method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Brennan (finance) |last=Brennan |first=J. |authorlink2=Eduardo Schwartz |last2=Schwartz |first2=E. |jstor=2352967 |title=Evaluating Natural Resource Investments |journal=[[The Journal of Business]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=135–157 |doi=10.1086/296288}}&lt;/ref&gt; its use is relatively uncommon today—particularly amongst practitioners—due to the required mathematical sophistication; these too cannot readily be used for high-dimensional problems.

Various other methods, aimed mainly at [[wikt:practitioner|practitioner]]s, have been developed for real option valuation. These typically use [[Cash flow|cash-flow]] scenarios for the projection of the future pay-off distribution, and are not based on restricting assumptions similar to those that underlie the closed form (or even numeric) solutions discussed. The most recent additions include the [[Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation|Datar–Mathews method]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Datar |first=V. |last2=Mathews |first2=S. |year=2004 |title=European Real Options: An Intuitive Algorithm for the Black Scholes Formula |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages= |doi= |ssrn=560982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mathews |first=S. |last2=Datar |first2=V. |year=2007 |title=A Practical Method for Valuing Real Options: The Boeing Approach |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=95–104 |doi= 10.1111/j.1745-6622.2007.00140.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation|fuzzy pay-off method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collan |first=M. |last2=Fullér |first2=R. |last3=Mezei |first3=J. |year=2009 |title=[[Fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation|Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation]] |journal=Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences |volume=2009 |issue=13601 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1155/2009/238196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The relevance of Real options, even as a thought framework, may be limited due to market, organizational and / or technical considerations.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;Ronald Fink: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/articles/realitycheck.htm Reality Check for Real Options], ''CFO Magazine'', September, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When the framework is employed, therefore, the analyst must first ensure that ROV is relevant to the project in question. These considerations are as below.

===Market characteristics===
As discussed [[Real options valuation#Applicability of standard techniques|above]], the market and environment underlying the project must be one where "change is most evident", and the "source, trends and evolution" in product demand and supply, create the "flexibility, contingency, and volatility" &lt;ref name="Mauboussin"/&gt;
which result in optionality. Without this, the NPV framework would be more relevant.

===Organizational considerations===
Real options are "particularly important for businesses with a few key characteristics",&lt;ref name="Mauboussin"/&gt; and may be less relevant otherwise.&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt;  In overview, it is important to consider the following in determining that the RO framework is applicable:
#Corporate strategy has to be adaptive to contingent events. Some corporations face organizational rigidities and are unable to react to market changes; in this case, the NPV approach is appropriate.
# Practically, the business must be positioned such that it has appropriate information flow, and opportunities to act. This will often be a [[market leader]] and / or a firm enjoying [[economy of scale|economies of scale]] and scope.
# Management must understand options, be able to identify and create them, and appropriately exercise them.&lt;ref name="Zhang &amp; Babovic"/&gt; This contrasts with business leaders focused on maintaining the status quo and / or near-term accounting earnings.
# The [[Statement of Financial Position|financial position]] of the business must be such that it has the ability to fund the project as, and when,  required (i.e. issue shares, absorb further debt and / or use internally generated cash flow); see [[Financial statement analysis]]. Management must, correspondingly, have appropriate access to this capital.
# Management must be in the position to exercise, in so far as some real options are proprietary (owned or exercisable by a single individual or a company) while others are shared (can (only) be exercised by many parties).

===Technical considerations===
Limitations as to the use of these models arise due to the contrast between Real Options and [[option (finance)|financial options]], for which these were originally developed. The main difference is that the [[underlying]] is often not tradable&amp;nbsp;– e.g. the factory owner cannot easily sell the factory upon which he has the option. Additionally, the real option itself may also not be tradeable&amp;nbsp;– e.g. the factory owner cannot sell the right to extend his factory to another party, only he can make this decision (some real options, however, can be sold, e.g., ownership of a vacant lot of land is a real option to develop that land in the future). Even where a market exists&amp;nbsp;– for the underlying or for the option&amp;nbsp;– in most cases there is limited (or no) [[market liquidity]].  Finally, even if the firm can actively adapt to market changes, it remains to determine the right paradigm to discount future claims

The difficulties, are then:

# As above, data issues arise as far as estimating key model inputs. Here, since the value or price of the underlying cannot be (directly) observed, there will always be some (much) uncertainty as to its value (i.e. [[spot price]]) and [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] (further complicated by uncertainty as to management's actions in the future).
# It is often difficult to capture the rules relating to exercise, and consequent actions by management. Further, a project may have a portfolio of embedded real options, some of which may be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="Zhang &amp; Babovic"/&gt;
# Theoretical difficulties, which are more serious, may also arise.&lt;ref name="Dias2"&gt;See Marco Dias: [http://www.puc-rio.br/marco.ind/faq4.html Does Risk-Neutral Valuation Mean that Investors Are Risk-Neutral?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195259/http://www.puc-rio.br/marco.ind/faq4.html |date=2010-07-16 }}, [http://www.puc-rio.br/marco.ind/faq5.html Is It Possible to Use Real Options for Incomplete Markets?]&lt;/ref&gt;
::*Option pricing models are built on [[Rational pricing#Options|rational pricing]] logic. Here, essentially: (a) it is presupposed that one can create a "hedged portfolio" comprising one option and "delta" shares of the underlying. (b) [[Arbitrage]] arguments then allow for the option's price to be estimated today; see [[Rational pricing#Delta hedging|Rational pricing #Delta hedging]]. (c) When hedging of this sort is possible, since delta hedging and risk neutral pricing are ''mathematically'' identical, then [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|risk neutral valuation]] may be applied, as is the case with most option pricing models. (d) Under ROV however, the option and (usually) its underlying are clearly not traded, and forming a hedging portfolio would be difficult, if not impossible.
::*Standard option models: (a) Assume that the risk characteristics of the underlying do not change over the life of the option, usually expressed via a [[Black–Scholes#Model assumptions|constant volatility assumption]]. (b) Hence a standard, risk free rate may be applied as the [[discount window|discount rate]] at each decision point, allowing for risk neutral valuation. Under ROV, however: (a) managements' actions actually change the risk characteristics of the project in question, and hence (b) the [[Required rate of return]] could differ depending on what state was realised, and a [[Capital asset pricing model#Asset-specific required return|premium over risk free]] would be required, invalidating (technically) the risk neutrality assumption.

These issues are addressed via several interrelated assumptions:

# As discussed [[Real options analysis#Valuation inputs|above]], the data issues are usually addressed using a simulation of the project, or a listed proxy. Various new methods&amp;nbsp;– see for example [[Real options valuation#Valuation methods|those described above]]&amp;nbsp;– also address these issues.
# Also [[Real options analysis#Valuation methods|as above]], specific exercise rules can often be accommodated by coding these in a bespoke [[binomial options pricing model|binomial tree]]; see:.&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"/&gt;
# The theoretical issues:
::*To use standard option pricing models here, despite the difficulties relating to rational pricing, practitioners adopt the [[Legal fiction|"fiction"]] that the real option and the underlying project are both traded: the so called, Marketed Asset Disclaimer (MAD) approach. Although this is a strong assumption, it is pointed out that a similar fiction in fact underpins standard NPV / DCF valuation (and using simulation as above). See:&lt;ref name="Borison"/&gt; and.&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"/&gt;
::*To address the fact that changing characteristics invalidate the use of a constant discount rate, some analysts use the "[[Rational pricing#The replicating portfolio|replicating portfolio approach]]", as opposed to [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|Risk neutral valuation]], and modify their models correspondingly.&lt;ref name="Copeland&amp;Tufano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reilly &amp; Brown"/&gt; Under this approach, (a) we "replicate" the cash flows on the option by holding a risk free bond and the underlying in the correct proportions. Then, (b) since the cash flows of the option and the portfolio will ''always'' be identical, by arbitrage arguments their values may (must) be equated ''today'', and (c) ''no'' discounting is required.

==History==
Whereas business managers have been making capital investment decisions for centuries, the term "real option" is relatively new, and was coined by Professor [[Stewart Myers]] of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1977. In 1930, [[Irving Fisher]] wrote explicitly of the "options" available to a business owner (''[[Irving Fisher#Selected publications|The Theory of Interest]]'', [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Fisher/fshToI6.html II.VIII]). The description of such opportunities as "real options", however, followed on the development of analytical techniques for [[Option (finance)|financial options]], such as [[Black–Scholes]] in 1973. As such, the term "real option" is closely tied to these option methods.

Real options are today an active field of academic research. Professor [[Lenos Trigeorgis]] has been a leading name for many years, publishing several influential books and academic articles. Other pioneering academics in the field include Professors [[Eduardo Schwartz]], Graham Davis, [http://www.gonzalocortazar.com/ Gonzalo Cortazar], [[Michael Brennan (finance)|Michael Brennan]], [http://people.few.eur.nl/jsmit/ Han Smit], [[Avinash Dixit]] and [[Robert Pindyck]] (the latter two, authoring the pioneering text in the discipline).  An academic conference on real options is organized yearly ([[Annual International Conference on Real Options]]).

Amongst others, the concept was "popularized" by [[Michael Mauboussin|Michael J. Mauboussin]], then chief U.S. investment strategist for [[Credit Suisse First Boston]].&lt;ref name="Mauboussin"&gt;Michael J. Mauboussin, Credit Suisse First Boston, 1999. [http://www.capatcolumbia.com/Articles/FoFinance/Fof10.pdf ''Get Real: Using Real Options in Security Analysis'']&lt;/ref&gt; He uses real options to explain the gap between how the stock market prices some businesses and the "[[Intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]]" for those businesses. Trigeorgis also has broadened exposure to real options through layman articles in publications such as [[The Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref name="TrigeorgisBroschSmit"&gt;Lenos Trigeorgis, Rainer Brosch and Han Smit. [http://sloanreview.mit.edu/business-insight/articles/2007/4/49410/stay-loose/ ''Stay Loose''], copyright 2010 [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; This popularization is such that ROV is now a standard offering in [[Master of Finance|postgraduate finance degrees]], and often, even in [[MBA]] curricula at many [[Business Schools]].

Recently, real options have been employed in [[business strategy]], both for valuation purposes and as a [[conceptual framework]].&lt;ref name="Pettit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sammer"/&gt; The idea of treating strategic investments as options was popularized by [[Timothy Luehrman]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_realoptions.html valuebasedmanagement.net]&lt;/ref&gt; in two [[Harvard Business Review|HBR]] articles:&lt;ref name="Luehrman"&gt;Timothy Luehrman: "Investment Opportunities as Real Options: Getting Started on the Numbers". ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' 76, no. 4 (July&amp;nbsp;– August 1998): 51–67.; "Strategy as a Portfolio of Real Options". ''Harvard Business Review'' 76, no. 5 (September–October 1998): 87-99.&lt;/ref&gt; "In financial terms, a business strategy is much more like a series of options, than a series of static cash flows". Investment opportunities are plotted in an "option space" with dimensions "volatility" &amp; value-to-cost ("NPVq").

Luehrman also co-authored with William Teichner a [[Harvard business school cases|Harvard Business School case study]], ''Arundel Partners: The Sequel Project'', in 1992, which may have been the first business school case study to teach ROV.&lt;ref name="LuehrmanTeichner"&gt;Timothy A. Luehrman and William A. Teichner: [http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cb/search/Arundel%2520Partners%253A%2520The%2520Sequel "Arundel Partners: The Sequel Project."] ''[[Harvard Business School Publishing]]'' case no. 9-292-140 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the [[Mainstream economics|"mainstreaming"]] of ROV, Professor [[Robert C. Merton]] discussed the essential points of Arundel in his [[Nobel Prize]] [[Nobel Prize#Nobel lecture|Lecture]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Merton, [[Nobel Prize#Nobel lecture|Nobel Lecture]]: [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1997/merton-lecture.pdf ''Applications of Option-Pricing Theory: Twenty-Five Years Later''], Pages 107, 115; reprinted: ''[[American Economic Review]]'', [[American Economic Association]], vol. 88(3), pages 323–49, June.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arundel involves a group of investors that is considering acquiring the sequel rights to a portfolio of yet-to-be released feature films. In particular, the investors must determine the value of the sequel rights before any of the first films are produced. Here, the investors face two main choices. They can produce an original movie and sequel at the same time ''or'' they can wait to decide on a sequel after the original film is released. The second approach, he states, provides the option ''not'' to make a sequel in the event the original movie is not successful. This real option has economic worth and can be valued monetarily using an option-pricing model. See [[Option (filmmaking)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">'''Shivlal Nagindas''' (Born 1939) is a [[Fiji]]an businessman of [[India]]n descent, who served in 2006 as President of the [[Labasa Chamber of Commerce]].  He has also held political office as a [[Senate of Fiji|Senator]], as a [[Labasa]] [[Local government in Fiji|Town Councillor]].  The Town Council elected Nagindas, a member of the [[Fiji Labour Party]], Deputy Mayor of Labasa on 30 October 2006.

His father, an immigrant from [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), India, arrived in Fiji in 1929 and established a [[tailoring]] and [[upholstery]] business in Labasa, on the northern island of [[Vanua Levu]].  The fifth of four brothers and three sisters, Nagindas left school at the age of 15 to work in the family business because of family hardships, ending his dream of becoming a [[lawyer]].  He worked in [[New Zealand]] for a six-month period in 1956 before returning to Labasa to work for [[R.K. Patel and Company]].  He established his own shoe shop in 1964, with the help of a loan.

Nagindas was elected to the Labasa Town Council in 1983, serving till 1986, and was again [[Fijian municipal election, 2005|elected]] to this post in October 2005.  In addition, he served in the Senate, the [[upper house]] of Fiji's [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], in 1999 and 2000.  He has also been a [[Justice of the Peace]] since 1991, and received the [[Fiji Independence Medal|Independence Medal]] in 1995 on the 25th anniversary of Fiji's independence, in recognition of his services to the community.

In the mid-2000s, he campaigned for improved infrastructure in and around Labasa, including a bypass road, a port of entry to boost international trade, and airport upgrades.  He also advocated the building of a sports stadium.

== Personal life ==
Nagindas has an adult son and daughter, both of whom live in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.

'''Silicon Valley''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''SV''') is a region in the southern [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of [[Northern California]] which serves as a global center for [[high technology]], [[innovation]] and [[social media]]. It corresponds roughly to the geographical [[Santa Clara Valley]].  [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] is the Valley's largest city, the third largest in [[California]], and the tenth largest in the [[United States]]. Other major Silicon Valley cities include [[Palo Alto]], [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]],[[Cupertino]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Orma |first1=Stephanie |title=How Silicon Valley's New Luxury Park James Hotel Got Its Personality |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieorma/2018/11/14/how-silicon-valleys-new-luxury-park-james-hotel-got-its-personality/#7cb274195044 |accessdate=29 November 2018 |publisher=Forbes |date=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third highest GDP per capita in the world (after [[Zurich, Switzerland]] and [[Oslo, Norway]]), according to the [[Brookings Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/01/23/san-jose-has-worlds-third-highest-gdp-per-capita.html Silicon Valley Business Journal – San Jose Area has World's Third-Highest GDP Per Capita, Brookings Says]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "silicon" originally referred to the large number of [[silicon]] [[Integrated circuit|chip]] innovators and manufacturers in the region, but the area is now the home to many of the world's largest [[Technology company|high-tech corporations]], including the headquarters of 39 businesses in the [[Fortune 1000]], and thousands of [[startup company|startup companies]]. Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the [[venture capital]] investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and [[startup ecosystem]] for high-tech innovation and scientific development. It was in the Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the [[microprocessor]], and the microcomputer, among other key technologies, were developed. As of 2013, the region employed about a quarter of a million [[information technology]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly employment continues upward climb|url=http://www.siliconvalleyindex.org/index.php/economy/employment|publisher=Silicon Valley Index|accessdate=September 24, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130924195800/http://www.siliconvalleyindex.org/index.php/economy/employment|archivedate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area's two other major cities, [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], the "Silicon Valley" has come to have two definitions: a geographic one, referring to [[Santa Clara County]], and a [[metonym]]ical one, referring to all high-tech businesses in the Bay Area. The term is now generally used as a [[synecdoche]] for the American high-technology [[economic sector]]. The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, and thus inspired [[List of places with "Silicon" names|similar named locations]], as well as [[List of research parks|research parks]] and [[List of technology centers|technology centers]] with a comparable structure all around the world.

== Origin of the term ==
The popularization of the name is credited to [[Don Hoefler]], who first used it in the article "Silicon Valley in the USA", appearing in the January 11, 1971 issue of the weekly trade newspaper ''[[Electronic News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laws |first1=David |title=Who named Silicon Valley? |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-named-silicon-valley/ |website=Computer History Museum |date=January 7, 2015 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained widespread use in the early 1980s, at the time of the introduction of the [[IBM PC]] and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market.

Silicon Valley was born through several contributing factors intersecting, including a skilled [[STEM fields|STEM]] research base housed in area universities, plentiful [[venture capital]], and steady [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] spending. [[Stanford University]] leadership was especially important in the valley's early development. Together these elements formed the basis of its growth and success.&lt;ref name=Castells2011p52&gt;{{cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |author-link=Manuel Castells |year=2011 |title=The Rise of the Network Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FihjywtjTdUC&amp;pg=PT52|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |page=52 |isbn=978-1-4443-5631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 1899, the first [[ship-to-shore]] wireless telegraph message to be received in the US was from the San Francisco lightship outside the [[Golden Gate]], signaling the return of the American fleet from the Philippines after their victory in the [[Spanish–American War]].{{when|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HnZRwXzjNnMC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103|title=Lighthouses of the Pacific Coast|last=Leffingwell|first=Pamela Welty, Randy|date=2010|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9781610604383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship had been outfitted with a wireless telegraph transmitter by a local newspaper, so that they could prepare a celebration on the return of the American sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Jane|title=Electronics in the West: The First Fifty Years|year=1967|publisher=National Press Books|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PBCAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local historian [[Clyde Arbuckle]] states in ''Clyde Arbuckle's History of San Jose''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arbuckle|first1=Clyde|title=Clyde Arbuckle's History of San Jose|date=1986|publisher=Memorabilia of San Jose|location=San Jose, CA|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "California first heard the click of a telegraph key on September 11, 1853.  It marked completion of an enterprise begun by a couple of San Francisco Merchants' Exchange members named George Sweeney and Theodore E. Baugh…"  He says, "In 1849, the gentleman established a wigwag telegraph station a top a high hill overlooking Portsmouth Squares for signaling arriving ships… The operator at the first station caught these signals by telescope and relayed them to the Merchant's Exchange for the waiting business community."  Arbuckle points to the historic significance the [[Merchants Exchange Building (San Francisco)]] and [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco]] when he goes on to say "The first station gave the name ''Telegraph'' to the hill on which it was located.  It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.  Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire."

According to Arbuckle (p.&amp;nbsp;380–381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E. Allen and C. Burnham led the way to "build a line from San Francisco to Marysville via San Jose, Stockton, and Sacramento."  Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, "…San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.  The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24."

The Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology. In 1909, [[Charles Herrold]] started the first [[radio]] station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Later that year, Stanford University graduate [[Cyril Frank Elwell|Cyril Elwell]] purchased the U.S. patents for [[Arc converter|Poulsen arc]] radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in [[Palo Alto]]. Over the next decade, the FTC created the world's first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.&lt;ref name=Sturgeon&gt;{{cite book |last=Sturgeon |first=Timothy J. |year=2000 |chapter=How Silicon Valley Came to Be |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLxzUW4V_2cC&amp;pg=PA15|editor-last=Kenney |editor-first=Martin |title=Understanding Silicon Valley: The Anatomy of an Entrepreneurial Region |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLxzUW4V_2cC |publisher=Stanford University|isbn=978-0-8047-3734-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Air Base Sunnyvale]], California, was commissioned by the United States Government for use as a Naval Air Station (NAS) to house the airship [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|USS Macon]] in [[Hangar One (Mountain View, California)|Hangar One]]. The station was renamed NAS Moffett Field, and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moffettfieldmuseum.org/history.html|title=Moffett Field History|first=Dave|last=Black|work=moffettfieldmuseum.org|accessdate=April 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406011808/http://moffettfieldmuseum.org/history.html|archivedate=April 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy. When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA, forerunner of [[NASA]]) took over portions of Moffett Field for [[aeronautics]] research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with [[aerospace]] firms, such as [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].

=== Ham radio ===
The Bay Area was an early center of [[ham radio]] with about 10% of the operators in the United States. William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and [[Charles Litton, Sr.|Charles Litton]], who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay Area, were hobbyists with training in technology gained locally who participated in development of [[shortwave radio]] by the ham radio hobby. [[High frequency]], and especially, [[Very high frequency]], VHF, transmission in the 10 meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse which controlled vacuum tube manufacture. Litton, founder of [[Litton Industries]], pioneered manufacturing techniques which resulted in award of wartime contracts to manufacture transmitting tubes for [[radar]] to [[Eimac|Eitel-McCullough]], a San Bruno firm, which manufactured power-grid tubes for radio amateurs and aircraft radio equipment.&lt;ref name=MSV13-40&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930–1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-62211-0|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Welfare capitalism ===
A union organizing drive in 1939–40 at Eitel-McCullough by the strong Bay Area labor movement was fought off by adoption of a strategy of [[welfare capitalism]] which included pensions and other generous benefits, profit sharing, and such extras as a medical clinic and a cafeteria. An atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration was established.&lt;ref name=MSV40,41&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930–1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-62211-0|pages=40, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successes have been few and far between&lt;ref name=Versatronex&gt;{{cite web|author1=David Bacon|title=Silicon Valley On Strike!

=== U.S. response to Sputnik ===
On October 4, 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first space satellite, [[Sputnik]], which sparked fear that the Soviet Union was pulling ahead technologically. After President Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (NASA), he turned to [[Fairchild Semiconductor]],{{Explain|date=October 2018}} then the only company in the world that was able to make transistors.  The president funded Fairchild's project,{{Explain|date=October 2018}} which was highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/silicon/|title=Timeline.Silicon Valley.American Experience.WGBH – PBS|work=American Experience|accessdate=April 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417035644/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/silicon/|archivedate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stanford University ===
[[Stanford University]], its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of this area.&lt;ref name="Markoff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|title=Searching for Silicon Valley|last=Markoff|first=John|date=April 17, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=April 17, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429065011/http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|archivedate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include the work of [[Lee De Forest]] with his invention of a pioneering vacuum tube called the [[Audion]] and the oscilloscopes of [[Hewlett-Packard]].

A very powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley. From the 1890s, Stanford University's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient local industry. Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Adams, "Regionalism in Stanford's Contribution to the Rise of Silicon Valley", ''Enterprise &amp; Society'' 2003 4(3): 521–543&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and 1950s, [[Frederick Terman]], as Stanford's dean of engineering and provost, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. He is credited with nurturing [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Varian Associates]], and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford campus. Terman is often called "the father of Silicon Valley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Tajnai |first= Carolyn |date= May 1985 |title= Fred Terman, the Father of Silicon Valley |url= http://forum.stanford.edu/carolyn/terman |website= Stanford Computer Forum |publisher= Carolyn Terman |accessdate= December 10, 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141211020643/http://forum.stanford.edu/carolyn/terman |archivedate= December 11, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, [[William Shockley]], the creator of the [[transistor]], moved from [[New Jersey]] to [[Mountain View, California]], to start [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] to live closer to his ailing mother in [[Palo Alto]]. Shockley's work served as the basis for many electronic developments for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leonhardt |first=David |date=April 6, 2008 |title=Holding On |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/realestate/keymagazine/406Lede-t.html?pagewanted=all |quote=In 1955, the physicist William Shockley set up a semiconductor laboratory in Mountain View, partly to be near his mother in Palo Alto. … |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 7, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525020611/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/realestate/keymagazine/406Lede-t.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=May 25, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Markoff |first=John |date=January 13, 2008 |title=Two Views of Innovation, Colliding in Washington |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EEDC153BF930A25752C0A96E9C8B63&amp; |quote=The co-inventor of the transistor and the founder of the valley's first chip company, William Shockley, moved to Palo Alto, Calif., because his mother lived there. ... |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 7, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125434/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EEDC153BF930A25752C0A96E9C8B63&amp; |archivedate=January 1, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1955–85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory|Shockley Semiconductor]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], and [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]. In 1969, the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), operated one of the four original nodes that comprised [[ARPANET]], predecessor to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Lécuyer, "What Do Universities Really Owe Industry? The Case of Solid State Electronics at Stanford," ''Minerva: a Review of Science, Learning &amp; Policy'' 2005 43(1): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stanford Industrial Park ===
After World War II, universities were experiencing enormous demand due to returning students. To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs. Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand [[ink jet printer]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1984.htm|title=History of Computing Industrial Era  1984–1985|work=thocp.net|accessdate=April 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428155324/http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1984.htm|archivedate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early tenants included [[Eastman Kodak]], [[General Electric]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stanford Research Park: The Engine of Silicon Valley|url=http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanford-research-park.php|work=PaloAltoHistory.com|accessdate=March 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329094048/http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanford-research-park.php|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The silicon transistor ===
In 1953, [[William Shockley]] left [[Bell Labs]] in a disagreement over the handling of the invention of the [[transistor]]. After returning to [[California Institute of Technology]] for a short while, Shockley moved to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]], in 1956, and founded [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]]. Unlike many other researchers who used [[germanium]] as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that [[silicon]] was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the "simple" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the "[[traitorous eight]]". Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Gordon Moore]], would go on to found [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodheart |first=Adam |date=July 2, 2006 |title=10 Days That Changed History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/weekinreview/02goodheart.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902050843/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/weekinreview/02goodheart.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=September 2, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SV110&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLaughlin |first1=John |last2=Weimers |first2=Leigh |last3=Winslow |first3=Ward |year=2008 |title=Silicon Valley: 110 Year Renaissance |url=http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/silicon-valley-110-year-renaissance-book/|publisher=[[Silicon Valley Historical Association]]|isbn=0-9649217-4-X|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152340/http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/silicon-valley-110-year-renaissance-book/ |archivedate=April 2, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History (1971 and later) ==

=== Computer chips ===
{{Main|Invention of the integrated circuit}}
In April 1974, [[Intel]] released the [[Intel 8080]],&lt;ref name="Electronic News Apr 1974"&gt;{{cite news |last= Intel | title= From CPU to software, the 8080 Microcomputer is here | newspaper= Electronic News |location= New York |pages= 44–45 |publisher= Fairchild Publications |date= April 15, 1974}}'' Electronic News'' was a weekly trade newspaper. The same advertisement appeared in the [[:File:Intel 8080 Advertisement May 1974.jpg|May 2, 1974 issue of ''Electronics'' magazine]].&lt;/ref&gt; a "computer on a chip", "the first truly usable microprocessor". A microprocessor incorporates the functions of a [[computer]]'s [[central processing unit]] (CPU) on a single [[integrated circuit]] (IC).&lt;ref name=Osborne80&gt;{{cite book | first=Adam | last=Osborne | title=An Introduction to Microcomputers | volume=Volume 1: Basic Concepts | edition=2nd | publisher=Osborne-McGraw Hill | location=Berkeley, California | year=1980 | isbn=0-931988-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homebrew Computer Club ===
{{Main|Microcomputer revolution}}
[[File:Invitation to First Homebrew Computer Club meeting.jpg|thumb|Invitation to first Homebrew Computer Club meeting (sent to Steve Dompier).]]
The [[Homebrew Computer Club]] was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, [[Electronic circuit|circuits]], and information pertaining to [[DIY]] construction of computing devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/homebrew_and_how_the_apple.php|title=Homebrew And How The Apple Came To Be|work=atariarchives.org|accessdate=April 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407041946/http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/homebrew_and_how_the_apple.php|archivedate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by [[Gordon French]] and [[Fred Moore (activist)|Fred Moore]] who met at the Community Computer Center in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. They both were interested in maintaining a regular, open forum for people to get together to work on making computers more accessible to everyone.&lt;ref name=Dormouse&gt;{{cite book |last=Markoff |first=John |year=2006 |orig-year=2005 |title=What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFbjjwEACAAJ|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-0-14-303676-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting was held as of March 1975 at French's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[San Mateo County, California]]; which was on occasion of the arrival of the [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] [[Altair 8800|Altair]] microcomputer, the first unit sent to the area for review by [[People's Computer Company]].  [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]] credit that first meeting with inspiring them to design the original [[Apple I]] and (successor) [[Apple II]] computers. As a result, the first preview of the [[Apple I]] was given at the Homebrew Computer Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wozniak |first=Steve |title=iWoz |year=2006 |publisher=W.W.

=== Venture capital ===
By the early 1970s, there were many [[semiconductor]] companies in the area, [[computer]] firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both. Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. The growth was fueled by the emergence of [[venture capital]] on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3 billion [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980.
{{Wide image|Silicon Vally Venture Capital investment.png|800px|Silicon Vally Venture Capital investment|100%|center}}

=== Media ===
In 1980, ''Intelligent Machines Journal'' -a hobbyist journal- changed its name to ''[[InfoWorld]]'', and, with offices in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], began covering the explosive emergence of the microcomputer industry in the valley.&lt;ref name=FireForward&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Markoff|title=Foreword, Fire in the Valley|date=September 1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-135892-7|pages=''xi–xiii''|edition=Updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
Although semiconductors are still a major component of the area's economy, Silicon Valley has been most famous in recent years for innovations in software and [[Internet]] services. Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.

Using money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].

While Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over Stanford's campus Ethernet.

=== The Internet ===
Commercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout  the early 1990s.

In 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.&lt;ref name=N1995&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. Josephujjwal sarkar Campbell|title=1995: The Year the Future Began|date=January 2, 2015|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27399-3|chapter=The Year of the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet bubble ===
Silicon Valley is generally considered to have been the center of the [[dot-com bubble]], which started in the mid-1990s and collapsed after the [[NASDAQ]] [[stock market]] began to decline dramatically in April 2000. During the bubble era, real estate prices reached unprecedented levels. For a brief time, [[Sand Hill Road]] was home to the most expensive commercial real estate in the world, and the booming economy resulted in severe [[traffic congestion]].

=== Early 21st century ===
After the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley continues to maintain its status as one of the top research and development centers in the world. A 2006 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' story found that 12 of the 20 most inventive towns in America were in California, and 10 of those were in Silicon Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115352188346314087 Reed Albergotti, "The Most Inventive Towns in America",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203065605/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115352188346314087 |date=December 3, 2017 }} ''Wall Street Journal'', July 22–23, 2006, P1.&lt;/ref&gt; San Jose led the list with 3,867 utility patents filed in 2005, and number two was Sunnyvale, at 1,881 utility patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon Valley is also home to a significant number of "[[Unicorn (finance)|Unicorn]]" ventures, referring to [[Startup company|startup companies]] whose [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] has exceeded $1 billion [[United States dollar|dollars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Unicorn List|url=http://fortune.com/unicorns/xiaomi-1/|accessdate=April 6, 2015|publisher=Fortune|date=January 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411235623/http://fortune.com/unicorns/xiaomi-1/|archivedate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical boundaries of Silicon Valley have changed over the years, traditionally Silicon Valley is known as Santa Clara County, southern San Mateo County and southern Alameda county.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/04/19/obrien-welcome-to-the-new-and-expanded-silicon-valley/|title=Welcome to the new and expanded Silicon Valley|last=O'Brien|first=Chris|date=April 19, 2012|work=The Mercury News|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|quote="After years of drawing a sharp circle that included Santa Clara County as well as southern San Mateo and Alameda counties, this newspaper is expanding the geographic boundaries that it considers to be part of Silicon Valley to include the five core Bay Area counties: Santa Clara, San Mateo, San Francisco, Alameda and Contra Costa."}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the years this geographical area has been expanded to include San Francisco County, Contra Costa County, and the northern parts of Alameda County and San Mateo County, this shift has occurred due to the expansion in the local economy and the development of new technologies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemalone/2013/06/05/silicon-valleys-newest-address-look-east/#25a2a8842270|title=Silicon Valley's Newest Address?

'''Software quality assurance''' ('''SQA''') consists of a means of monitoring the [[software engineering]] processes and methods used to ensure quality. The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as [[ISO 9000]] or a model such as [[CMMI]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelemen, Zádor Dániel; Kusters, Rob; Trienekens Jos  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.549/abstract Identifying criteria for multimodel software process improvement solutions – based on a review of current problems and initiatives ]&lt;/ref&gt;

SQA encompasses the entire [[software development]] process, which includes processes such as requirements definition, [[software design]], [[Computer programming|coding]], [[Revision control|source code control]], [[code review]]s, [[software configuration management]], [[Software testing|testing]], [[release management]], and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, David [http://www.pmhut.com/cmm-and-project-quality-management CMM and Project Quality Management ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Software quality assurance, according to [[ISO/IEC 15504]] v.2.5 (SPICE), is a supporting process that has to provide the independent assurance in which all the work products, activities and processes comply with the predefined plans and ISO 15504.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In business, '''stealth mode''' is a company's temporary state of secretiveness, usually undertaken to avoid alerting competitors to a pending product launch or other business initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=stealth+mode&amp;i=56097,00.asp|title=Definition of stealth mode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hush&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_4_29/ai_73121430|accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=Entrepreneur|title=Hush Hush - stealth product development can protect innovations|date=April 2001|author=Mark Henricks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''stealth product''' is a product a company develops in secret, and a '''stealth company''' is a new company that avoids initial disclosure as to its existence, purpose, products, personnel, funding, brand name, or other important attributes. The term '''stealth innovation''' has been applied to individual projects and ideas that are developed in secret inside a company.&lt;ref name="Stealth innovation article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Paddy|author2=Wedell-Wedellsborg, Thomas |title=The Case for Stealth Innovation|journal=[[Harvard Business Review]]|date=March 2013|url=http://hbr.org/2013/03/the-case-for-stealth-innovation/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Whereas secrecy is the historical norm in many fields of business,&lt;ref name=hush/&gt; [[Startup company|start-up companies]] often thrive on publicity and open sharing of information.  Openness is common to the business culture of [[Silicon Valley]] and other technology centers, with competitors freely exchanging news of discoveries, products under development, and other company news.  There is intense media interest in some business sectors, with even relatively small [[funding round]]s covered in specialized press. [[Public relations]] is considered useful to attract interest from talent, customers, and investors, and to promote the careers of the people involved.  Additionally, competitors often collaborate on projects, or buy each other's products.

Some companies nevertheless avoid publicity in fields that are ordinarily not secretive.  Among the reasons, a small, relatively unfunded company may wish to avoid giving companies with more resources time to develop competing technologies.  The very announcement that a larger or better-known company is working on a competing product may damp interest in the smaller upstart.  If the innovative company has no realistic means of protecting its new [[intellectual property]], it may seek to obtain a "[[first-mover advantage]]" by waiting until the company or its products are ready to sell before they are announced.  This gives as long a lead as possible before others may copy its products, distribution channels, brand, or other business advantages.  Conversely, companies with a protectable new technology may nevertheless wish to wait until they have filed or obtained a [[patent]].&lt;ref name=hush/&gt;

==Behavior==
When an entire company is in stealth mode it may attempt to mislead the public about its true company goals.  For example, it may give code names to its pending products.&lt;ref name=hush/&gt;  It may operate a [[corporate website]] that does not disclose its personnel or location.  New companies may operate under a temporary "stealth name" that does not disclose its field of business.

To enforce stealthy behavior, companies often require employees to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, and strictly control who may speak with the media.&lt;ref name=hush/&gt;

At the in-company level, stealth mode can also refer to a new project or idea that is kept secret, not just from external parties, but also from internal stakeholders in order to avoid a (premature) dismissal of the idea. Key behaviors can include soliciting informal project sponsors, engaging in covert testing of the concept, freeing up extra resources and building a "cover story" for the project.&lt;ref name="Stealth innovation article" /&gt;

'''''The Halo Effect''''' is a book by business academic Phil Rosenzweig that criticizes [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] tendencies in the explanation of business performance.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The book was published by Free Press on February 6, 2007. As well as many business magazines and newspapers, the text targets specific books (those that offer secrets of guaranteed business success) and academic research published by [[business schools]]. It outlines nine "delusions": mistakes of reasoning that undermine these recipes for business success. In light of these mistakes, Rosenzweig argues, much of business writing is what [[Richard Feynman]] called "[[cargo cult science]]", having the superficial trappings of [[science]] but operating at the level of [[narrative|story-telling]]. The book also considers some more scientific business research, whose conclusions are more rigorous but do not promise a simple recipe for success. The subtitle of the 2007 US edition is "and the Eight Other Business Delusions that Deceive Managers" while that of the 2008 UK edition is "How Managers Let Themselves Be Deceived".

The book was named "Business Book of the Year" 2007 at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business Books: Titles that got attention in 2007 | work=Reuters|date=December 6, 2007|author=Lisa Von Ahn |publisher=Thomas Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN0539788520071206|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as part of a trend for books that encourage [[evidence-based practice]] in business research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/04/12/luck_inc/|title=Luck, Inc.: The 7 secrets of really, really lucky companies|last=Bennett|first=Drake |date=April 12, 2009 |work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The author told reporters the book had been written over the course of 25 years of experience in business consultancy and academia.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Rosenzweig earned his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], before serving on the faculty at [[Harvard Business School]] and later at the [[International Institute for Management Development]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; His corporate career included seven years at [[Hewlett-Packard]].&lt;ref name="stern" /&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Targets===
The book is critical of a genre of business books including ''[[In Search of Excellence]]'', ''[[Good to Great]]'', ''What Really Works'' and ''[[Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies|Built to Last]]''. It finds similar faults with a swathe of [[business journalism]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

===Nine delusions===
# ''The Halo Effect'' of the book's title refers to the [[Halo effect|cognitive bias]] in which the perception of one quality is contaminated by a more readily available quality (for example good-looking people being rated as more intelligent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett |first=Richard E.|author2=Timothy D. Wilson |year=1977|title=The halo effect: Evidence for unconscious alteration of judgments|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=35|issue=4|pages=250–256|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.4.250 |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/92158/1/TheHaloEffect.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of business, observers think they are making judgements of a company's customer-focus, quality of leadership or other virtues, but their judgement is contaminated by indicators of company performance such as [[share price]] or [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]]. [[Correlations]] of, for example, customer-focus with business success then become meaningless, because success was the basis for the measure of customer focus.
# ''The Delusion of Correlation and Causality:'' mistakenly thinking that [[correlation is not causation|correlation is causation]].
# ''The Delusion of Single Explanations:'' arguments that factor X improves performance by 40% and factor Y improves by another 40%, so both at once will result in an 80% improvement. The fallacy is that X and Y might be very strongly correlated. E.g. X might improve performance by causing Y.
# ''The Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots:'' looking only at successful companies and finding their common features, without comparing them against unsuccessful companies.
# ''The Delusion of Rigorous Research:'' Some authors boast of the amount of data that they have collected, as though that in itself made the conclusions of the research valid.
# ''The Delusion of Lasting Success:'' the "secrets of success" books imply that lasting success is achievable, if only managers will follow their recommended approach. Rosenzweig argues that truly lasting success (outperforming the market for more than a generation) never happens in business.
# ''The Delusion of Absolute Performance:'' market performance is down to what competitors do as well as what the company itself does. A company can do everything right and yet still fall behind.
# ''The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick:'' getting cause the wrong way round. E.g. successful companies have a Corporate Social Responsibility policy. Should we infer that CSR contributes to success, or that profitable companies have money to spend on CSR?
# ''The Delusion of Organisational Physics:'' the idea that business performance is non-chaotically determined by discoverable factors, so that there are rules for success out there if only we can find them.
