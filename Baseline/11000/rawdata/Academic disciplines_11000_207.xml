In [[immunology]], an '''immunoglobulin allotype''' is the [[allele]] of the [[antibody]] chains found in the individual. The word allotype comes from two Greek roots, ''allo ''meaning 'other or differing from the norm' and ''typos ''meaning 'mark'. Thus allotype refers to the idea that each immunoglobulin has unique sequences particular to the individual's genome that manifest in its constant region (normally).

The most important types are Gm ([[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]]) and km ([[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]]).

It can be used in resolving paternity disputes.&lt;ref name="urlTHE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS - ANTIBODIES"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mayer/IgTypes2000.htm |title=THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS - ANTIBODIES |work= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural engineer (PE)''' is a [[professional engineering]] designation in the [[United States]]. The architectural engineer applies the knowledge and skills of broader [[engineering]] disciplines to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and renovation of buildings and their component systems while paying careful attention to their effects on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asce.org/architectural-engineering/architectural-engineering-institute/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of a specific "Architectural Engineering" [[NCEES]] [[professional engineering]] registration examination in the 1990s and first offering in April 2003,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncees.org&lt;/ref&gt; architectural engineering is now recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States.

Note that in the United States "architectural engineering technology" is different from architectural engineering;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abet.org&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States architectural engineering technologists tend to be drafters or assistants for the design and construction process, while in Europe, Canada, South Africa and other countries [[Architectural technologists]] have a role similar to [[Architects]] and Architectural Engineers.

==Areas of focus==
* [[Architecture]] (if licensed as an [[Architect]])
* [[Structural engineering]]
* [[Construction engineering]]
* [[Construction management]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Green building]]
* [[Heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC)
* [[Plumbing]] and [[piping]] ([[hydronics]])
* [[Energy management]]
* [[Fire protection engineering]]
* Building power systems
* [[Lighting]]
* [[Building transportation systems]]
* [[Acoustics]], [[noise]] &amp; [[vibration]] control

A common combined specialization is ''[[Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing]]'', better known by its abbreviation '''MEP'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/3688.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  An MEP design engineer has experience in HVAC, lighting/electrical, and plumbing systems' analysis and design.

==Some topics of special interest==
* [[Building construction]]
* [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM)
* [[Efficient energy use]], [[Energy conservation]] or [[Energy demand management]]
* [[Renewable energy]]
* [[Solar energy]]
* [[Green building]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9802">'''Art destruction''' involves the damaging or destruction of works of [[art]]. This can happen through a natural process, an accident, or deliberate human involvement.

==Natural destruction==
All physical works of art are slowly affected and degraded by the natural elements. Some may survive long enough to allow the slow processes of erosion to act on them. Works of art may also be destroyed by natural disasters.

*The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is slowly eroding. Most experts believe it is a natural process, but some believe acid rain is accelerating the process.
*It is estimated that tens of thousands of works of [[Japanese art]] dating as far back as the 13th century were destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] and the ensuing firestorm that destroyed much of central Tokyo.
*1,400 artworks were damaged beyond repair in the November 4, 1966, floods that devastated [[Florence]], Italy, including [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|The Crucifixion]]''.
*[[Ribeira Palace]] destroyed during [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. Inside, the 70,000-volume royal library as well as hundreds of works of art, including paintings by Titian, Rubens, and Correggio, were lost. The royal archives disappeared together with detailed historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators.
*[[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]] was destroyed by fire on the Christmas Eve of 1734 with its gallery (Velázquez, Titian, Rubens, Ribera, and others.)

==Accidental destruction==
{{Main|Accidental damage of art}}
Many works of art have been damaged or destroyed by accident.
* On September 2, 1998, [[Swissair Flight 111]] crashed near [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada, killing 225 people. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1963 work ''Le Peintre'' (The Painter) had been loaded on the flight as cargo and was also destroyed.
* In May 2004 a fire destroyed the [[Momart]] warehouse in east London which destroyed more than 50 works by abstract painter [[Patrick Heron]] and works by other artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/27/1085641648774.html?from=storyrhs|title=Art world reels as losses mount|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional destruction==
===Of artwork designed to be destroyed===
[[File:Lightmatter burningman.jpg|thumb|300px|Burning Man]]

Many works of visual art are intended by the artist to be temporary. They may be created in media which the artist knows to be temporary, such as sand, or they may be designed specifically to be destroyed. Often the destruction takes place during a ceremony or special event highlighting the destruction. Examples of this type of art include:
*[[Street painting]]
*[[Sand mandala]]
*[[Ice sculpture]]
*[[Sand art and play|Sand castles]]
*Food art or Edible art

Additionally, some artists destroy their own work out of lack of self confidence or to gain a fresh start (the prior art still inside their head).  [[Claude Monet]] with [[Haystacks (Monet)|destroying 30 paintings in the water lilies series]] and other paintings, or the [[John Baldessari]] collective 1953 - 1966 works in a 1970 bonfire were famous examples. An artist also may limit the number and quality variation of his work to make it more scarce, therefore gain a reputation of increasing in later valuations.

Festivals where artwork is destroyed:
*The week-long ''[[Burning Man]]'' festival in the desert of [[Nevada]], which began in 1986 with tens of thousands of participants who must pay a fee to attend, an entire city of art and self-expression is created. The focal point of the festival is a temple designed and built by artists. On the last day of the festival there is a ceremony known as a Temple Burn where the temple goes up in flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://burningman.org/event/art-performance/playa-art/building-the-temple/|title=Building the Temple|work=Burning Man|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Semana Santa]]'' (Easter week) festival in [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], [[Guatemala]], where designs made out of flowers and colored sawdust are created in the street prior to being trampled by a religious parade.
*The burning of [[Zozobra]] during [[Fiestas de Santa Fe]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], usually during the second week of September.
*The burning of [[falles]] in [[Valencia]], Spain.

===Of artwork not designed to be destroyed===
Other works of art may be destroyed without the consent of the original artist or of the local community. In other instances, works of art may destroyed by a local authority against the wishes of the outside community. Examples of this include the removal of [[Diego Rivera]]'s ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' mural from the [[Rockefeller Center]] and the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] statues by the [[Taliban]] government.
More than 14 Gustav Klimt masterpieces burned in a fire set by retreating SS forces at [[Immendorf Castle]] in May 1945

*[[Iconoclasm]] is the general destruction of a type of work of art for religious or ideological reasons. Most publicly visible [[classical art]] showing religious subjects was destroyed or disfigured by Christians, {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} mostly after theirs had become the state religion. The same process was inflicted on classical and pagan art after the [[Muslim conquests]], a process which continued for centuries, especially in India. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
*The [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] was an internal process within the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], led by changes of [[Byzantine Emperor]], which was reversed after nearly a century.
*In the [[Protestant Reformation]], a great deal of Medieval and Renaissance religious art was destroyed in Protestant areas, mostly in orderly official removals, but sometimes in riotous attacks, of which the most notable was the [[Beeldenstorm]] which swept the [[Low Countries]] in the summer of 1566 kicking off the [[Dutch Revolt]]. 
*The [[French Revolution]] ushered in a period of widespread art destruction, motivated by anti religious and anti royalist ideology, both in France itself and other countries conquered in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Similar destruction occurred for similar ideological motives following other revolutions such as the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian revolution|Russian Revolution]], the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], and the wars that sometimes followed them. 
*In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Nazi Germany]] destroyed works of art they labeled "[[degenerate art]]". These were often non-realistic forms of art such as [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Art created by [[Secular Jewish culture#Visual arts|Jewish artists]] was also destroyed.
*Tens of thousands of works of art were destroyed in military actions in [[World War II]]. One of the best-known examples in Europe is [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet's]] ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'', which was destroyed in [[Dresden]] in 1945 during the Allied bombings. The original of [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', a work with an iconic status in the US, was destroyed in a British bombing of [[Bremen]]. Other works of art were destroyed in [[the Blitz]], in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and throughout [[Southeast Asia]].
*Artworks destroyed in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] in the United States included a painted wood relief by [[Louise Nevelson]], a painting from [[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s ''Entablature'' series and a [[Joan Miró]] tapestry. The total value of artwork lost in the September 11 attacks is said to have been in excess of $100 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1581737.stm|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks|date=5 October 2001|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Corridart]] was an eight-kilometer exhibit of artworks in [[Montreal]], intended to be part of the arts and cultural component of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]], who deemed the artworks ugly, had them torn down two days before the Olympic games began.
*In 1956, a vandal [[Mona Lisa#Theft and vandalism|threw acid at the Louvre museum's Mona Lisa]], damaging it.
*In 2017, [[2017 Louvre machete attack|a terror suspect attacked guards of the Louvre with machetes]] and was found carrying "bombs of aerosol paint" intended to "disfigure the masterpieces of the [Louvre] museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Emilie Blachère|title=Attack at the Louvre: the tourist was a terrorist|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Attaque-au-Louvre-le-touriste-etait-un-terroriste-1184744|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Paris Match|date=13 February 2017|language=French|quote=Investigators found bombs of aerosol paint in his bag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4913">[[File:Singapadu Bali Pura-Puseh-Desa-03.jpg|thumb|right|A representation of a Bhoma head guarding the top of the portal to a Balinese temple in Singapadu.]]
In a [[Balinese temple|Balinese temple architecture]],  a '''Bhoma''' is a carved or formed [[Chimera (architecture)|grotesque]] which decorates certain parts in the Balinese temple complex. The statue is similar to the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]], and was intended to protect the temple complex from malevolent spirit.

==Mythology==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zilveren broche voorstellende een Bhoma monsterkop TMnr 2252-6.jpg|thumb|left|The bhoma in a silver brooch.]]
In Balinese mythology, Bhoma is the son of [[Vishnu|Dewa Wisnu]] and [[Prithvi|Dewi Pertiwi]], the god of rain and the goddess of earth. One day, when Wisnu was digging the earth in the form of [[Varaha]], his avatar in the form of a wild boar, he encountered a beautiful earth goddess named Dewi Pertiwi. The encounter leads to a union between Wisnu and Pertiwi, which produce a terrifying son named Bhoma. 

The story of Wisnu as a wild boar digging up to the bottom of the earth to meet Pertiwi symbolizes torrents of stormy rainwater entering the earth. The figure of Bhoma that was produced by this union is seen as the growth of vegetation or forest ([[Vanaspati]]) as a result of the earth receiving the (rain) water. In Javanese and Balinese culture, Vanaspati is the king of the plant, not different with the European [[Green Man]]. The word Bhoma came from the Sanskrit word ''bhaumá'', which means something that grows or is born from earth or something related to the earth.  

==Architecture==
[[File:Balinese temple pillar.jpg|thumb|left|In the [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]], the central shrine of a Balinese temple complex, the Bhoma head is carved at the bottom of Padmasana shrine to symbolize the forest which surrounds the base of a mountain.]] 
Bhoma is basically the Balinese [[kirtimukha]]. In Balinese temple architecture, Bhoma has the same function as the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]] which act as a guardian spirit of the temple complex. The head of Bhoma can be found carved at the temple gate which marks the entrance to the holiest part of the shrine ([[paduraksa]]) and at the base of the padmasana, the holiest and most central shrine in the Balinese temple.

The [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]] is the holiest shrine in a Balinese temple complex. The padmasana is attributed to the Supreme God, the [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa]]). Like many religious constructions in Indonesia, the shrine padmasana is divided into three sections, from the base to the top, the ''bhur'' (world of demons), ''bhuwah'' (world of men), and ''swah'' (world of gods). The head figure of Bhoma normally added the base of the padmasana, together with other monstrous figures e.g. the Bedawang Nala, the world-supporting turtle, and the two snakes, Anantaboga, and Basuki, a symbol of man's earthly needs. In this context, the head of Bhoma at the base of the padmasana symbolizes the forest which surrounds the foot of a mountain (''batur pepalihan'').{{sfn|Eiseman|2011}} 

In some Balinese houses, the doorway to some enclosed pavilion (e.g. the ''[[Balinese traditional house|bale meten]]'') is decorated with ornaments to form ventilation grill which is sometimes paneled. This is usually topped with a decorative frieze, which is sometimes carved in the form of the Bhoma's head.{{sfn|Davison|Granquist|2012}}

The head of Bhoma is also seen in the [[Ngaben|Balinese cremation towers]].{{sfn|Slattum|2003|pp=100-1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Brachymeiosis''' was a hypothesized irregularity in the [[Ascomycota#Sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction of ascomycete fungi]], a variant of [[meiosis]] following an "extra" [[karyogamy]] (nuclear fusion) step. The hypothesized process would have transformed four [[diploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] into eight [[haploid]] ones. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that brachymeiosis does not occur in any fungi.&lt;ref name="Carlile"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Carlile | first=Michael J. | title=Two influential mycologists: Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (1879-1967) and Lilian Hawker (1908-1991) | journal=Mycologist | volume=19 | issue=03 | year=2005 | pages=129–131 | doi=10.1017/s0269915x05003058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the current understanding, [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]] reproduce by forming male and female organs ([[Antheridium|antheridia]]/spermatia and [[ascogonium|ascogonia]]), transferring [[haploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] from the antheridium to the ascogonium, and growing a dikaryotic [[ascus]] containing both nuclei. Karyogamy then occurs in the ascus to form a diploid nucleus, followed by meiosis and [[mitosis]] to form eight haploid nuclei in the [[ascospore]]s.&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dube | first=H.C. | title=Introduction To Fungi, 3E | publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Limited | year=2009 | isbn=978-81-259-1433-4 | page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the botanist [[Robert Almer Harper|R.A. Harper]] reported the observation of a second karyogamy event in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny. This would imply the creation of a tetraploid nucleus in the ascus, rather than a diploid one; in order to produce the observed haploid ascospores, a second meiotic reduction in chromosome count would then be necessary. The second reduction was hypothesized to occur during the second or third mitotic division in the ascus, even though chromosome reduction does not typically occur during mitosis. This supposed form of meiosis was termed “brachymeiosis” in 1908 by H. C. I. Fraser.&lt;ref name="Swingle"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Swingle | first=D.B. | title=Fertilization in ''Ascodesmis nigricans'' Van Tiegh| journal=American Journal of Botany | date=1934 | jstor=2436104 | volume=21 |pages=519–545 | doi=10.2307/2436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of brachymeiosis was controversial throughout the first half of the twentieth century, with many conflicting results published. Then, research with improved staining techniques established clearly that only one reductive division occurs in the asci of all examined species, including some which had been believed to undergo brachymeiosis.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hirsch | first=Hilde E. | title=No Brachymeiosis in Pyronema Confluens | journal=Mycologia | volume=42 | issue=2 | year=1950 | page=301 | doi=10.2307/3755444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Olive"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive |first=L. S. |year=1949 |title=Cytological evidence opposing the theory of brachymeiosis in the ascomycetes |journal=Science |volume=110 |page=185 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/110/2851/185.1 |doi=10.1126/science.110.2851.185}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these studies, the theories of double fusion and subsequent brachymeiosis were discarded around 1950.&lt;ref name="Carlile" /&gt;

The '''''Cancionero de Turin''''' or '''''Cancionero Musical de Turin''''' is a musical [[manuscript]] that contains Spanish secular [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] works from the period between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, in the transition period between the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras.

== The manuscript ==
The manuscript is kept at the [[Turin National University Library|National University Library]] (R.1–14) in [[Turin]], Italy.

The index section lists 47 works, but one of them is duplicated. Th manuscript includes three other works that are not listed in the index, two of which are also duplicated. On the other hand, the works listed as numbers 36 and 37, ''Salte y baile'' and ''Mi voluntad no me dexa'' are in fact parts of a single work titled ''Por dinero baila el perro''. Therefore, the cancionero contains 46 individual works. One of them is for 4 voices, 35 are for 3 voices and the ten remaining are for 2 voices. The musical forms employed are the [[villancico]], the [[canción]] and the [[Romance (music)|romance]].

All the pieces are anonymous, but one of them, ''Sobre moradas violetas'', is also found in the [[Cancionero de la Sablonara]], attributed to the [[Sevillian]] guitarist and composer [[Juan de Palomares]], on a text by Catalina Zamudio.

Several texts were extracted from the [[romancero]] or were written by known authors, such as [[Lope de Vega]], Catalina Zamudio, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7612">The '''candle problem''' or '''candle task''', also known as '''Duncker's candle problem''', is a [[cognitive test|cognitive]] [[Performance test (assessment)|performance test]], measuring the influence of [[functional fixedness]] on a participant's [[problem solving]] capabilities. The test was created by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Karl Duncker]]&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html|title=Dan Pink on the surprising science of motivation|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published posthumously in 1945.  Duncker originally presented this test in his thesis on problem-solving tasks at [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name="5th European Conference on e-Learning "&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniel Biella and Wolfram Luther|title=5th European Conference on e-Learning |pages=23|chapter=A Synthesis Model for the Replication of Historical Experiments in Virtual Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhS1sd3gEB4C&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=the+candle+problem+karl+duncker&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20candle%20problem%20karl%20duncker&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-905305-30-8 | publisher=Academic Conferences Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
The test presents the participant with the following task: how to fix and light a [[candle]] on a wall (a [[cork board]]) in a way so the candle wax won't drip onto the table below.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "&gt;{{cite book|title=Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction Volume 3: Conative and Affective Process Analysis |editor=Richard E. Snow and Marshall J. Farr|chapter=Positive Affect and Organization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNepLHdEhUMC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=duncker+candle+task&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqrF8VXHLB&amp;sig=G0P3JWGkkSvnA9fxmc2_BeRuO0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=69pRS4bcEo-Ytgecy_2mCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=duncker%20candle%20task&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-89859-721-9 | year=1987 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, one may only use the following along with the candle:

*a book of matches
*a box of thumbtacks

==Solution==
[[File:Genimage.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The candle problem]]
The solution is to empty the box of thumbtacks, use the thumbtacks to nail the box to the wall, put the candle into the box,  and light the candle with the match.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt; The concept of functional fixedness predicts that the participant will only see the box as a device to hold the thumbtacks and  not immediately perceive it as a separate and functional component available to be used in solving the task.

==Response==
Many of the people who attempted the test explored other creative, but less efficient, methods to achieve the goal. For example, some tried to tack the candle to the wall without using the thumbtack box,&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt; and others attempted to melt some of the candle’s wax and use it as an [[adhesive]] to stick the candle to the wall.&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "/&gt; Neither method works.&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "/&gt; However, if the task is presented with the tacks piled ''next'' to the box (rather than inside it), virtually all of the participants were shown to achieve the optimal solution, which is self defined.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/frank.pdf|title=Against Informational Atomism|last=Frank|first=Michael|accessdate=15 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184646/http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/frank.pdf#|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test has been given to numerous people, including [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] students at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] in a study investigating whether living abroad and creativity are linked.&lt;ref name="Kellogg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index.php/Kellogg/article/living_outside_the_box|title=Living Outside the Box: Living abroad boosts creativity |date=April 2009|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glucksberg==
[[Sam Glucksberg|Glucksberg]] (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Glucksberg | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1037/h0044683 | title = The influence of strength of drive on functional fixedness and perceptual recognition | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 63 | pages = 36–41 | year = 1962 | pmid =  13899303| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; used a 2 × 2 design manipulating whether the tacks and matches were inside or outside of their boxes and whether subjects were offered cash prizes for completing the task quickly. Subjects who were offered no prize, termed ''low-drive'', were told "We are doing pilot work on various problems in order to decide which will be the best ones to use in an experiment we plan to do later. We would like to obtain norms on the time needed to solve." The remaining subjects, termed ''high-drive'', were told "Depending on how quickly you solve the problem you can win $5.00 or $20.00. The top 25% of the ''S''s [subjects] in your group will win $5.00 each; the best will receive $20.00. Time to solve will be the criterion used." (As a note, adjusting for inflation since 1962, the study's publish year, the amounts in {{inflation-year|US}} dollars would be approximately ${{inflation|US|5|1962}} and ${{inflation|US|20|1962}}, respectively.{{inflation-fn|US}}) The empty-boxes condition was found to be easier than the filled-boxes condition: more subjects solved the problem, and those who did solve the problem solved it faster. Within the filled-boxes condition, high-drive subjects performed ''worse'' than low-drive subjects. Glucksberg interpreted this result in terms of "neobehavioristic drive theory": "high drive prolongs extinction of the dominant habit and thus retards the correct habit from gaining ascendancy". An explanation in terms of the [[overjustification effect]] is made difficult by the lack of a main effect for drive and by a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction within the empty-boxes condition.

Another way to explain the higher levels of failure during the high-drive condition is that the process of turning the task into a competition for limited resources can create mild levels of stress in the subject, which can lead to a [[sympathetic nervous system]] response known as [[fight-or-flight]].  This stress response effectively shuts down the creative thinking and problem solving areas of the brain in the [[prefrontal cortex]].

==Linguistic implications==
[[E. Tory Higgins]] and W. M. Chaires found that having subjects repeat the names of common pairs of objects in this test, but in a different and unaccustomed linguistic structure, such as "box ''and'' tacks" instead of "box ''of'' tacks", facilitated performance on the candle problem.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt; This phrasing helps one to distinguish the two entities as different and more accessible.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt;
     
In a written version of the task given to people at [[Stanford University]], Michael C. Frank and [[language acquisition]] [[List of language acquisition researchers|researcher]] Michael Ramscar reported that simply underlining certain relevant materials ("''on the table there is a &lt;u&gt;candle&lt;/u&gt;, a &lt;u&gt;box&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;tacks&lt;/u&gt;, and a &lt;u&gt;book&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;matches&lt;/u&gt;''...") increases the number of candle-problem solvers from 25% to 50%.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">'''Certified AM Directional Specialist''' (AMD) is a specialist title granted to an individual that successfully meets the prerequisite certification and examination requirements. The certification is regulated by the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] (SBE), and demonstrates competence in the design and maintenance of AM Directional antenna facilities. The "Certified AM Directional Specialist" title is protected by [[copyright]] laws. Individuals who use the title without consent from the Society of Broadcast Engineers could face legal action.

The SBE certifications were created to recognize individuals who practice in career fields which are not regulated by state licensing or [[Professional Engineering]] programs. Marine Radio and radar systems still require a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) license apart from an SBE certification. Broadcast Engineering is regulated at the national level and not by individual states.

[[File:Dewbow on a spiderweb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dewbow on a spiderweb]]

A '''dewbow''' is an [[optical effect]], similar to a [[rainbow]], where [[dew]]drops instead of rain droplets reflect and disperse sunlight.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/dewbow.htm|title=Dewbow|last=Boyle|first=Kevin |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary of Dewbows"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlop|first=Storm|title=Weather|publisher=Collins|year=2009|pages=151|isbn=978-0-00-784141-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Dewbows can be seen on fields covered with dew, when the sun shines. Dew forms outdoors in the early morning after a clear night, when the surface temperature drops below the [[dew point]]. It forms most easily on surfaces that are isolated from conducted heat from deep ground, such as grass, leaves, and spider webs. Dew bows will be clearest on fields littered with cobwebs, as may occur in autumn. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=dew_bow|title=Dew bow |last=Edens|first=Harald  |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shape==
A ''rainbow'' is perceived as a circle in the sky; and its contributing light rays form a cone. In contrast, a ''dewbow'' is perceived as the intersection of that cone and the ground. If the ground is flat and horizontal, and the sun is low in the sky, the dew bow is a [[hyperbola]]. Theoretically, when the sun is high, the intersection might be another [[conic section]], like a [[parabola]] or an [[ellipse]].&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt; However, dew usually evaporates before the sun is high. Nonetheless, an elliptical dew bow was captured on camera, when at night the full moon, high in the sky, illuminated a field loaded with dew.&lt;ref name="Großmann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atoptics.wordpress.com/author/atoptics/page/10/|title=Dew bow|last=Großmann|first=Michael |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nationalism sidebar}}

'''Ethnosymbolism''' is a [[school of thought]] in the study of [[nationalism]] that stresses the importance of symbols, myths, values and traditions in the formation and persistence of the modern [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerges as the critical theory of [[Nationalism#Modernist interpretation|modernism]], which argues the antiquity and ''la [[longue durée]]'' of nation while modernists believe nation's purely modern appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and Modernism|year=1998|publisher=London and New York: Routledge|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=|date=July 2017}} [[John Alexander Armstrong|John A. Armstrong]], [[Anthony D. Smith]] and [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]] are regarded as important theorists of ethnosymbolism.

The term was first used as "ethno-symbolist approach" in an article by Daniele Conversi, Smith's former student at the [[London School of Economics]]. However, Conversi was slightly critical, arguing: "if we focus exclusively on the power of the past and its symbols, we miss two other key features of nationalism: first, its relationship with political power, and particularly with the state; second, its crucial border-generating function".&lt;ref&gt;Conversi, Daniele (1995) 'Reassessing current theories of nationalism: Nationalism as boundary maintenance and creation', [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537119508428421#.UxovkhYeXkc Nationalism and Ethnic Politics], 1, 1, pp. 73 - 85 (p. 75)&lt;/ref&gt;
== Important theorists and theories ==

=== John A. Armstrong ===
Armstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his '''myth-symbol complexes''' in ''Nations before Nationalism'' published in 1982, which firstly underlined the significance of ''la [[longue durée]]'' according to Anthony D. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=History and National Destiny: Responses and Clarifications|year=2004|editor-last=Guibernau|editor-first=M.|editor2-last=Hutchinson|editor2-first=John|journal=History and National Identity: Ethnosymoblism and its Critics|publisher=Blackwell|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong believes that ethnic consciousness has existed for long, whose traces could even be found in ancient civilisations such as [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and nationalism is merely "the final stage of a larger cycle of ethnic consciousness reaching back to the earliest forms of collective organization". Therefore, similar to the ''longue durée'' of [[Annales School]], formation of ethnic identity should be examined in time dimensions of many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He emphasised the boundaries for human identity by adopting the social interaction model of [[Fredrik Barth]] and argues that "groups tend to define themselves not by reference to their own characteristics but by exclusion, that is, by comparison to 'strangers{{Single double}}. In other words, the character of a group is never fixed, and in accordance with group member's individual perceptions the boundaries of identities vary. Hence, comparing to the objective group characteristics, the boundary mechanisms of distinguishing a particular group from others should be studied more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=John A.|title=Nations before Nationalism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1982|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His conception of ethnic group defined by exclusion rules out any definitional way to distinguish ethnicity from other collective identity including religious and class identities, for which reason himself is more concerned with the shifting interactions among class, ethnic religious loyalties than with "compartmentalizing definitions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=John A.|title=Nations before Nationalism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1982|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Armstrong, "myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors", which indicates his emphasis on the persistence of these symbolic boundary mechanisms. He further specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence. The first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them. There are two fundamentally different ways of life: the nomadic and the sedentary. The second factor is religion, exemplified by Christianity and Islam both of which gave birth to different civilisations and the myths/symbols. The third factor is city, whose effect upon ethnic identification 'requires examination of a host of factors ranging from the impact
of town planning to the unifying of centrifugal effects of various legal codes, especially the [[Lübeck law|Lübeck]] and [[Magdeburg law]]. 

The fourth factor is imperial polities' role, whose central question is "how could the intense consciousness of loyalty and identity established through face-to-face contact in the city-state transferred to the larger agglomerations of cities and countryside known as empires"? The [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] myth of the polity as a reflection of heavenly rule, being called ''[[mythomoteur]]'' by Armstrong, is exemplified as "myth transference for political purposes" since it was used as vehicle for incorporating city-state loyalties in a larger framework.

The last factor is language. Uniquely, Armstrong concludes that "the significance of language for ethnic identity is highly contingent" in pre-modern era. Its significance relied on political and religious force and allegiances for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in his later works, he agrees with most modernists including [[Benedict Anderson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]] that national identity had been an invention, and the only remaining disagreement would be "over the antiquity of some inventions and the repertory of pre-existing group characteristics that inventors were able to draw upon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|editor-last=Periwal|editor-first=S.|journal=Notions of Nationalism|last=Armstrong|first=John A.|title=Towards a Theory of Nationalism: Consensus and Disconsensus|publisher=Central European University Press|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthony D. Smith ===
Although a former student of [[Ernest Gellner]], who is considered to represent [[Nationalism#Modernist interpretation|modernism]], [[Anthony D. Smith]] has perspectives of nationalism that differentiate him from his teacher. He is also the last contributor to the "[[London School of Economics|LSE]] debate" on nationalism (named by Gellner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|title=Encounters with Nationalism|publisher=Oxford:Blackwell|year=1995|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; His central thesis is that "modern state cannot be understood without taking pre-existing ethnic components into account, the lack of which is likely to create a serious impediment to 'nation-building'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has suggested theorists to define key terms such as "nation" and "nationalism" beyond the theoretical limitation of both modernism and [[primordialism]]. In his opinion, the problem of modernism is mainly that modernists define nation as "modern nation" with characters of European nations of 18th and 19th centuries, making their definition [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] and partial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=THe Genealogy of Nations: An Ethno-Symbolic Approach|editor-last=Ichijo|editor-first=A.|editor2-last=Uzelac|editor2-first=G.|journal=When is the Nation?|publisher=London and New York: Routeledge|year=2005|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he proposes an ideal-typical definition of the nation: "a named human population sharing an historic territory, common myths and historical memories, a mass, public culture, a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members".

He also introduces the important term '''''ethnie''''', a French word meaning "ethnic group", which is used to describe the pre-modern ethnic communities and contains six main attributes:

#a collective proper name
#a myth of common ancestry
#shared historical memories
#one or more differentiating elements of common culture
#an association with a specific "homeland"
#a sense of solidarity for significant sectors of the population.

These six attributes suggest that ''ethnie'' is "anything but primordial", for which reason that ''ethnie'' is formed and constructed.  Its formation is with two patterns: coalescence and division.  The former unites separate units, while the latter functions conversely.

According to Smith's observation, there are four main mechanisms of ethnic self-renewal:

#religious reform, exemplified with the history of [[Jews]].
#cultural borrowing, exemplified with encounter between [[Jewish culture|Jewish]] and [[culture of Greece|Greek]] cultures
#popular participation, exemplified with the socio-religious popular movement of the [[Mazdak#Mazdakism|Mazdakites]] in 5th-century [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]] undermining the foundations of the Sassanid state.
#myths of ethnic election, the lack of which might be related to the diminishment of ethnic survival of [[Assyria]], [[Phoenicia]] and the [[Philistines]].

In order to understand "why and how does the nation emerge?", Smith identifies two types of ethnic community: the lateral (aristocratic) and the vertical (demotic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=National Identity|publisher=London: Penguin|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his more recent work, Smith has added the third route of nation formation: immigrant nations that consist of the fragments of other ''ethnies'', such as the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and Modernism: A Criticle Survey of Recent Theories of Nations and Nationalism|publisher=London and New York: Routledge|year=1998|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Hutchinson ===
[[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]] was supervised by Smith while undertaking his PhD at the London School of Economics. His primary contribution to ethnosymbolism is the theory of '''cultural nationalism''' in ''the Dynamics of Cultural Nationalism'' (1987).

He separates nationalism into political nationalism and cultural nationalism, which are different, even competing conceptions of the nation, and "have sharply diverging political strategies".

Political nationalists are essentially [[cosmopolitism|cosmopolitan]] [[rationalists]] whose conception of nation "looks forward ultimately to a common humanity transcending cultural differences".  Although the fact that the world has been divided into multiple political communities has forced them to work within existing borders, political nationalists' objectives are to "secure a representative state for their community so that it might participate as an equal in the developing cosmopolitan rationalist civilization". Nationalism in most West European states after 18th century meets the criterion of political nationalism, which is also the nationalism that modernists including [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Benedict Anderson]] refer to in their works.

On the contrary, cultural nationalists believe that humanity is "infused with a creative force which endows all things with an individuality" similar to nature. They regard the state being accidental since a nation is essentially its distinctive civilisation which is "the product of its unique history, culture and geographical profile". Nations are ''organic entities'' and living personalities. In perspectives of cultural nationalists, nation is on the passions implanted by nature and history rather than "mere" consent or law. As the ''organic entity'', conflict, generally between ''ageing traditionalists'' and ''the educated young'', is not only inevitable for nation but also indispensable for nation's continuous renovation and regeneration. Such conclusion of features of cultural nationalism is based upon Hutchinson's observation of nationalism of late nineteenth century India and China, respectively represented by  [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Liang Qichao]]. On the other hand, cultural nationalism hardly draws attention from theories of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=John|title=Cultural Nationalism and Moral Regenration|editor-last=Hutchinson|editor-first=J.|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=A. D.|journal=Nationalism|year=1994|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|pages=122–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only has he challenged modernism in his earlier works, he has also engaged postmodernism in his more recent works, especially in ''Nations as Zones of Conflict'' (2005).

[[File:VibratingGlassBeam.jpg|thumb|290px|right|This vibrating glass beam may be modeled as a cantilever beam with acceleration, variable linear density, variable section modulus, some kind of dissipation, springy end loading, and possibly a point mass at the free end.]]

'''Euler–Bernoulli beam theory''' (also known as '''engineer's beam theory''' or '''classical beam theory''')&lt;ref name=Timoshenko&gt;Timoshenko, S., (1953), ''History of strength of materials'', McGraw-Hill New York&lt;/ref&gt; is a simplification of the linear [[theory of elasticity]] which provides a means of calculating the load-carrying and [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] characteristics of [[Beam (structure)|beams]]. It covers the case for small deflections of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] that are subjected to lateral loads only. It is thus a special case of [[Timoshenko beam theory]]. It was first enunciated circa 1750,&lt;ref name=Truesdell&gt;Truesdell, C., (1960), ''The rational mechanics of flexible or elastic bodies 1638–1788'', Venditioni Exponunt Orell Fussli Turici.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not applied on a large scale until the development of the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Ferris wheel]] in the late 19th century. Following these successful demonstrations, it quickly became a cornerstone of engineering and an enabler of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

Additional analysis tools have been developed such as [[plate theory]] and [[finite element analysis]], but the simplicity of beam theory makes it an important tool in the sciences, especially [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

== History ==
[[File:Poutre definitions en.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of cross-section of a bent beam showing the neutral axis.]]
Prevailing consensus is that [[Galileo Galilei]] made the first attempts at developing a theory of beams, but recent studies argue that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was the first to make the crucial observations. Da Vinci lacked [[Hooke's law]] and [[calculus]] to complete the theory, whereas Galileo was held back by an incorrect assumption he made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Bernoulli beam is named after [[Jacob Bernoulli]], who made the significant discoveries.  [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]] were the first to put together a useful theory circa 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

At the time, science and [[engineering]] were generally seen as very distinct fields, and there was considerable doubt that a mathematical product of academia could be trusted for practical safety applications. Bridges and buildings continued to be designed by precedent until the late 19th century, when the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Ferris wheel]] demonstrated the validity of the theory on large scales.

== Static beam equation ==

The Euler–Bernoulli equation describes the relationship between the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the applied load:&lt;ref name=Gere&gt;Gere, J. M. and Timoshenko, S. P., 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\left(EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\right) = q\,&lt;/math&gt;

The curve &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; describes the deflection  of the beam in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction at some position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (recall that the beam is modeled as a one-dimensional object). &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a distributed load, in other words a force per unit length (analogous to [[pressure]] being a force per area); it may be a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, or other variables.

Note that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elastic modulus]] and that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]] of the beam's cross-section. &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; must be calculated with respect to the axis which passes through the centroid of the cross-section and which is perpendicular to the applied loading.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;For an Euler–Bernoulli beam not under any axial loading this axis is called the [[neutral axis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, for a beam whose axis is oriented along ''x'' with a loading along ''z'', the beam's cross-section is in the ''yz'' plane, and the relevant second moment of area is
:&lt;math&gt; I = \iint z^2\; dy\; dz,&lt;/math&gt;
where it is assumed that the centroid of the cross-section occurs at ''y''&amp;nbsp;= ''z''&amp;nbsp;= 0.

Often, the product ''EI'' (known as the [[flexural rigidity]]) is a constant, so that

:&lt;math&gt;EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation, describing the deflection of a uniform, static beam, is used widely in engineering practice.  Tabulated expressions for the deflection &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; for common beam configurations can be found in engineering handbooks.  For more complicated situations the deflection can be determined by solving the Euler–Bernoulli equation using techniques such as the "[[slope deflection method]]", "[[moment distribution method]]", "[[Moment-area theorem|moment area method]], "[[conjugate beam method]]", "[[virtual work|the principle of virtual work]]", "[[Direct integration of a beam|direct integration]]", "[[Castigliano's method]]", "[[Macaulay's method]]" or the "[[direct stiffness method]]".

Sign conventions are defined here since different conventions can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;  In this article, a [[Right-hand rule|right-handed]] coordinate system is used as shown in the figure, Bending of an Euler–Bernoulli beam.  In this figure, the x and z direction of a right-handed coordinate system are shown.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z} \times \mathbf{e_x} =  \mathbf{e_y}  &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors in the direction of the x, y, and z axes respectively, the y axis direction is into the figure. Forces acting in the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; directions are assumed positive.  The sign of the bending moment &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is positive when the torque vector associated with the bending moment on the right hand side of the section is in the positive y direction (i.e. so that a positive value of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; leads to a compressive stress at the bottom fibers).  With this choice of bending moment sign convention, in order to have &lt;math&gt; dM = Qdx &lt;/math&gt;, it is necessary that &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; the shear force acting on the right side of the section be positive in the z direction so as to achieve static equilibrium of moments.  To have force equilibrium with &lt;math&gt; dQ = qdx &lt;/math&gt;, q, the loading intensity must be positive in the minus z direction.  In addition to these sign conventions for scalar quantities, we also sometimes use vectors in which the directions of the vectors is made clear through the use of the unit vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Successive derivatives of the deflection ''w'' have important physical meanings: d''w''/d''x'' is the slope of the beam,
:&lt;math&gt; M = -EI \frac{d^2w}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[bending moment]] in the beam, and
:&lt;math&gt;Q = -\frac{d}{d x}\left(EI\frac{d^2 w}{d x^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Shearing (physics)|shear force]] in the beam.
[[File:Euler-Bernoulli beam theory-2.svg|thumb|350px|Bending of an Euler–Bernoulli beam. Each cross-section of the beam is at 90 degrees to the neutral axis.]]
The stresses in a beam can be calculated from the above expressions after the deflection due to a given load has been determined.

=== Derivation of bending moment equation ===

Because of the fundamental importance of the bending moment equation in engineering, we will provide a short derivation.  The length of the neutral axis in the figure is &lt;math&gt;\rho d \theta.&lt;/math&gt; The length of a fiber with a radial distance, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, below the neutral axis is  &lt;math&gt;(\rho + e)d \theta.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, the strain of this fiber is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\left(\rho + e - \rho \right ) \ d \theta} {\rho \ d \theta} = \frac {e} {\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;

The stress of this fiber is &lt;math&gt; E\tfrac {e} {\rho}&lt;/math&gt; where E is the [[elastic modulus]] in accordance with [[Hooke's Law]].  The differential force vector, &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt; resulting from this stress is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{F} = E \frac{e}{\rho} dA \mathbf{e_x}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the differential force vector exerted on the right hand side of the section shown in the figure.  We know that it is in the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_x}&lt;/math&gt; direction since the figure clearly shows that the fibers in the lower half are in tension. &lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt; is the differential element of area at the location of the fiber. The differential bending moment vector, &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{M} &lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{M} = -e\mathbf{e_z} \times  d\mathbf{F} = -\mathbf{e_y} E \frac {e^2} {\rho} dA. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression is valid for the fibers in the lower half of the beam. The expression for the fibers in the upper half of the beam will be similar except that the moment arm vector will be in the positive z direction and the force vector will be in the -x direction since the upper fibers are in compression.  But the resulting bending moment vector will still be in the -y direction since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z} \times -\mathbf{e_x} =  -\mathbf{e_y}.&lt;/math&gt;  Therefore, we integrate over the entire cross section of the beam and get for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; the bending moment vector exerted on the right cross section of the beam the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} =\int d\mathbf{M} = -\mathbf{e_y} \frac {E} {\rho} \int {e^2} \ dA = -\mathbf{e_y} \frac {EI} {\rho},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]]. From calculus, we know that when &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dw}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is small as it is for an Euler–Bernoulli beam, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\rho} = \tfrac{d^2w}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of curvature]]).  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = -\mathbf{e_y} EI {d^2w \over dx^2} &lt;/math&gt;

== Dynamic beam equation ==
[[File:Beam mode 6.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[Finite element method]] model of a vibration of a wide-flange beam ([[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]]).]]
The dynamic beam equation is the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] for the  following action
:&lt;math&gt;
  S = \int_0^L \left[ \frac{1}{2} \mu \left( \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} EI \left( \frac{ \partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} \right)^2 + q(x) w(x,t)\right] dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first term represents the kinetic energy where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mass per unit length; the second one represents the potential energy due to internal forces (when considered with a negative sign) and the third term represents the potential energy due to the external load &lt;math&gt; q(x) &lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] is used to determine the function that minimizes the functional &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  For a dynamic Euler–Bernoulli beam, the Euler–Lagrange equation is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2}\left(EI\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\right) = - \mu\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + q(x)
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of Euler–Lagrange equation for beams
|-
|Since the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathcal{L} := \tfrac{1}{2} \mu \left( \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} \right)^2 - \tfrac{1}{2} EI \left( \frac{ \partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} \right)^2 + q(x) w(x,t) = \tfrac{\mu}{2}\dot{w}^2 - \tfrac{EI}{2}w_{xx}^2 + qw \equiv \mathcal{L}(x, t, w, \dot{w}, w_{xx})
 &lt;/math&gt;
the corresponding [[Euler–Lagrange equation#Single function of two variables with higher derivatives|Euler–Lagrange equation]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial w} - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{w}}\right)  + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{xx}}\right) = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial w} = q ~;~~ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{w}} = \mu\dot{w}
   ~;~~ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{xx}} = -EI w_{xx} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Plugging into the Euler–Lagrange equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   q - \mu\ddot{w} - (EI w_{xx})_{xx} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2}\left(EI\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\right) = - \mu\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + q
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
which is the governing equation for the dynamics of an Euler–Bernoulli beam.
|}
When the beam is homogeneous, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are independent of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the beam equation is simpler:
:&lt;math&gt;
  EI\cfrac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} = - \mu\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + q \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Free vibration ===
In the absence of a transverse load, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, we have the '''free vibration''' equation.  This equation can be solved using a Fourier decomposition of the displacement into the sum of harmonic vibrations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   w(x,t) = \text{Re}[\hat{w}(x)~e^{-i\omega t}]
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of vibration.  Then, for each value of frequency, we can solve an ordinary differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;
   EI~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 \hat{w}}{\mathrm{d}x^4} + \mu\omega^2\hat{w} = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The general solution of the above equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{w} = A_1\cosh(\beta x) + A_2\sinh(\beta x) + A_3\cos(\beta x) + A_4\sin(\beta x) \quad \text{with} \quad \beta := \left(\frac{\mu\omega^2}{EI}\right)^{1/4}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4&lt;/math&gt; are constants.  These constants are unique for a given set of boundary conditions.  However, the solution for the displacement is not unique and depends on the frequency.  These solutions are typically written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{w}_n = A_1\cosh(\beta_n x) + A_2\sinh(\beta_n x) + A_3\cos(\beta_n x) + A_4\sin(\beta_n x) \quad \text{with} \quad \beta_n := \left(\frac{\mu\omega_n^2}{EI}\right)^{1/4}\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The quantities &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''natural frequencies''' of the beam.  Each of the displacement solutions is called a '''mode''' and the shape of the displacement curve is called the '''mode shape'''.

==== Example: Cantilevered beam ====
[[File:BeamVibrationPlot.svg|thumb|400px|right|Mode shapes for the first four modes of a vibrating cantilever beam.]]
The boundary conditions for a cantilevered beam of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (fixed at &lt;math&gt; x = 0&lt;/math&gt;) are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   &amp;\hat{w}_n = 0 ~,~~ \frac{d\hat{w}_n}{dx} = 0 \quad \text{at} ~~ x = 0 \\
   &amp;\frac{d^2\hat{w}_n}{dx^2} = 0 ~,~~ \frac{d^3\hat{w}_n}{dx^3} = 0 \quad \text{at} ~~ x = L \,.
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we apply these conditions, non-trivial solutions are found to exist only if
&lt;math&gt;
   \cosh(\beta_n L)\,\cos(\beta_n L) + 1 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
This nonlinear equation can be solved numerically. The first few roots are ''β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 0.59686..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 1.49418..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 2.50025..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 3.49999..., ...

The corresponding natural frequencies of vibration are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_1 = \beta_1^2 \sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} = \frac{3.5161}{L^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} ~,~~ \dots
&lt;/math&gt;
The boundary conditions can also be used to determine the mode shapes from the solution for the displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{w}_n = A_1 \Bigl[(\cosh\beta_n x - \cos\beta_n x) +
      \frac{\cos\beta_n L + \cosh\beta_n L}{\sin\beta_n L + \sinh\beta_n L}(\sin\beta_n x - \sinh\beta_n x)\Bigr]
 &lt;/math&gt;
The unknown constant (actually constants as there is one for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, which in general is complex, is determined by the initial conditions at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; on the velocity and displacements of the beam. Typically a value of &lt;math&gt;A_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; is used when plotting mode shapes.  Solutions to the undampened forced problem have unbounded displacements when the driving frequency matches a natural frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the beam can '''resonate'''.  The natural frequencies of a beam therefore correspond to the frequencies at which '''resonance''' can occur.

==== Example: unsupported (free-free) beam ====

[[File:FreeBeamVibrationPlot.svg|thumb|400px|The first four modes of a vibrating free-free Euler-Bernoulli beam.]]

A free-free beam is a beam without any supports.&lt;ref name="???"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys1240/phys1240_fa15/homelabs/Beam_vibration_Mauro%20Caresta_UNSW.pdf |title=Vibrations of a Free-Free Beam |last1=Caresta |first1=Mauro |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary conditions for a free beam of length ''L'' extending from ''x''=0 to ''x''=L is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2\hat{w}_n}{dx^2} = 0 ~,~~ \frac{d^3\hat{w}_n}{dx^3} = 0 \quad \text{at} ~~ x = 0  \,\text{and} \, L \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we apply these conditions, non-trivial solutions are found to exist only if
&lt;math&gt;
   \cosh(\beta_n L)\,\cos(\beta_n L) - 1 = 0 \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

This nonlinear equation can be solved numerically. The first few roots are ''β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 1.50562..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 2.49975..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 3.50001..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 4.50000...

The corresponding natural frequencies of vibration are:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_1 = \beta_1^2 \sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} = \frac{22.3733}{L^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} ~,~~ \dots
&lt;/math&gt;
The boundary conditions can also be used to determine the mode shapes from the solution for the displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{w}_n = A_1 \Bigl[  (\sin\beta_n x+\sinh\beta_n x )-
      \frac{\sin\beta_n L - \sinh\beta_n L}{\cos\beta_n L - \cosh\beta_n L}(\cos\beta_n x + \cosh\beta_n x)\Bigr]
 &lt;/math&gt;
As with the cantilevered beam, the unknown constants are determined by the initial conditions at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; on the velocity and displacements of the beam. Also, solutions to the undampened forced problem have unbounded displacements when the driving frequency matches a natural frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stress ==
Besides deflection, the beam equation describes [[force]]s and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] and can thus be used to describe [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]]. For this reason, the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation is widely used in [[engineering]], especially civil and mechanical, to determine the strength (as well as deflection) of beams under bending.

Both the [[bending moment]] and the [[shear force]] cause stresses in the beam. The stress due to shear force is maximum along the [[neutral axis]] of the beam (when the width of the beam, t, is constant along the cross section of the beam; otherwise an integral involving the first moment and the beam's width needs to be evaluated for the particular cross section), and the maximum tensile stress is at either the top or bottom surfaces. Thus the maximum [[principal stress]] in the beam may be neither at the surface nor at the center but in some general area. However, shear force stresses are negligible in comparison to bending moment stresses in all but the stockiest of beams as well as the fact that [[stress concentration]]s commonly occur at surfaces, meaning that the maximum stress in a beam is likely to be at the surface.

=== Simple or symmetrical bending ===
[[File:BeamBendingUpdated.svg|thumb|350px|Element of a bent beam: the fibers form concentric arcs, the top fibers are compressed and bottom fibers stretched.]]
For beam cross-sections that are symmetrical about a plane perpendicular to the neutral plane, it can be shown that the tensile stress experienced by the beam may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{Mz}{I} = -zE ~ \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the neutral axis to a point of interest; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the bending moment. Note that this equation implies that [[pure bending]] (of positive sign) will cause zero stress at the neutral axis, positive (tensile) stress at the "top" of the beam, and negative (compressive) stress at the bottom of the beam; and also implies that the maximum stress will be at the top surface and the minimum at the bottom. This bending stress may be superimposed with axially applied stresses, which will cause a shift in the neutral (zero stress) axis.

=== Maximum stresses at a cross-section ===
[[File:SectionModulusOfBeam.svg|thumb|220px|Quantities used in the definition of the section modulus of a beam.]]
The maximum tensile stress at a cross-section is at the location &lt;math&gt;z = c_1&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum compressive stress is at the location &lt;math&gt;z = -c_2&lt;/math&gt; where the height of the cross-section is &lt;math&gt; h = c_1 + c_2 &lt;/math&gt;.  These stresses are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_1 = \cfrac{Mc_1}{I} = \cfrac{M}{S_1} ~;~~ \sigma_2 = -\cfrac{Mc_2}{I} = -\cfrac{M}{S_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The quantities &lt;math&gt;S_1,S_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[section modulus|section moduli]]&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt; and are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   S_1 = \cfrac{I}{c_1} ~;~~ S_2 = \cfrac{I}{c_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The section modulus combines all the important geometric information about a beam's section into one quantity.  For the case where a beam is doubly symmetric, &lt;math&gt;c_1 = c_2&lt;/math&gt; and we have one section modulus &lt;math&gt;S = I/c&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Strain in an Euler–Bernoulli beam ===&lt;!-- It's pronounced "oiler"; DO NOT write "a Euler"; it's "an Euler". --&gt;
We need an expression for the [[infinitesimal strain theory|strain]] in terms of the deflection of the neutral surface to relate the stresses in an Euler–Bernoulli beam to the deflection.  To obtain that expression we use the assumption that normals to the neutral surface remain normal during the deformation and that deflections are small.  These assumptions imply that the beam bends into an arc of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure 1) and that the neutral surface does not change in length during the deformation.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt; be the length of an element of the neutral surface in the undeformed state.  For small deflections, the element does not change its length after bending but deforms into an arc of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle subtended by this arc, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x = \rho~\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us now consider another segment of the element at a distance &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; above the neutral surface. The initial length of this element is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;.  However, after bending, the length of the element becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x' = (\rho-z)~\mathrm{d}\theta = \mathrm{d}x - z~\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  The strain in that segment of the beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_x = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}x'-\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}x} = -\cfrac{z}{\rho} = -\kappa~z
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[curvature]] of the beam.  This gives us the axial strain in the beam as a function of distance from the neutral surface.  However, we still need to find a relation between the radius of curvature and the beam deflection &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Relation between curvature and beam deflection ===
Let P be a point on the neutral surface of the beam at a distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the origin of the &lt;math&gt;(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system.  The slope of the beam is approximately equal to the angle made by the neutral surface with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis for the small angles encountered in beam theory.  Therefore, with this approximation,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \theta(x) = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, for an infinitesimal element &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;, the relation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x = \rho~\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \cfrac{1}{\rho} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}x} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = \kappa
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence the strain in the beam may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{x} = -z\kappa
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Stress-strain relations ===
For a homogeneous [[isotropy|isotropic]] [[linear elasticity|linear elastic]] material, the stress is related to the strain by &lt;math&gt;\sigma = E\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]].  Hence the stress in an Euler–Bernoulli beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_x = -zE\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note that the above relation, when compared with the relation between the axial stress and the bending moment, leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = -EI\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the shear force is given by &lt;math&gt;Q = \mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;, we also have
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q = -EI\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3w}{\mathrm{d}x^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Boundary considerations ==
The beam equation contains a fourth-order derivative in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  To find a unique solution &lt;math&gt;w(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; we need four boundary conditions.  The boundary conditions usually model ''supports'', but they can also model point loads, distributed loads and moments.  The ''support'' or displacement boundary conditions are used to fix values of displacement (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) and rotations (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}w/\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;) on the boundary.  Such boundary conditions are also called [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]].  Load and moment boundary conditions involve higher derivatives of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and represent [[flux|momentum flux]].  Flux boundary conditions are also called [[Neumann boundary condition]]s.

As an example consider a [[cantilever]] beam that is built-in at one end and free at the other as shown in the adjacent figure.  At the built-in end of the beam there cannot be any displacement or rotation of the beam.  This means that at the left end both deflection and slope are zero.  Since no external bending moment is applied at the free end of the beam, the bending moment at that location is zero.  In addition, if there is no external force applied to the beam, the shear force at the free end is also zero.

Taking the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of the left end as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and the right end as &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (the length of the beam), these statements translate to the following set of boundary conditions (assume &lt;math&gt;EI&lt;/math&gt; is a constant):

:&lt;math&gt;w|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\bigg|_{x = 0} = 0 \qquad \mbox{(fixed end)}\,&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Cantilever Beam.svg|thumb|400px|right|A cantilever beam.]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial^3 w}{\partial x^3}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0 \qquad \mbox{(free end)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

A simple support (pin or roller) is equivalent to a point force on the beam which is adjusted in such a way as to fix the position of the beam at that point. A fixed support or clamp, is equivalent to the combination of a point force and a point torque which is adjusted in such a way as to fix both the position and slope of the beam at that point. Point forces and torques, whether from supports or directly applied, will divide a beam into a set of segments, between which the beam equation will yield a continuous solution, given four boundary conditions, two at each end of the segment. Assuming that the product ''EI'' is a constant, and defining &lt;math&gt;\lambda=F/EI&lt;/math&gt; where ''F'' is the magnitude of a point force, and &lt;math&gt;\tau=M/EI&lt;/math&gt; where ''M'' is the magnitude of a point torque, the boundary conditions appropriate for some common cases is given in the table below. The change in a particular derivative of ''w'' across the boundary as ''x'' increases is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; followed by that derivative. For example, &lt;math&gt;\Delta w''=w''(x+)-w''(x-)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;w''(x+)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;w''&lt;/math&gt; at the lower boundary of the upper segment, while &lt;math&gt;w''(x-)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;w''&lt;/math&gt; at the upper boundary of the lower segment. When the values of the particular derivative are not only continuous across the boundary, but fixed as well, the boundary condition is written e.g., &lt;math&gt;\Delta w''=0^*&lt;/math&gt; which actually constitutes two separate equations (e.g., &lt;math&gt;w''(x-) = w''(x+)&lt;/math&gt; = fixed).

Note that in the first cases, in which the point forces and torques are located between two segments, there are four boundary conditions, two for the lower segment, and two for the upper. When forces and torques are applied to one end of the beam, there are two boundary conditions given which apply at that end. The sign of the point forces and torques at an end will be positive for the lower end, negative for the upper end.

== Loading considerations ==
Applied loads may be represented either through boundary conditions or through the function &lt;math&gt;q(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; which represents an external distributed load. Using distributed loading is often favorable for simplicity. Boundary conditions are, however, often used to model loads depending on context; this practice being especially common in vibration analysis.

By nature, the distributed load is very often represented in a piecewise manner, since in practice a load isn't typically a continuous function. Point loads can be modeled with help of the [[Dirac delta function]]. For example, consider a static uniform cantilever beam of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with an upward point load &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; applied at the free end. Using boundary conditions, this may be modeled in two ways.  In the first approach, the applied point load is approximated by a shear force applied at the free end.  In that case the governing equation and boundary conditions are:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  &amp; EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} = 0 \\
  &amp; w|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d} x}\bigg|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad
  \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0 \quad ; \quad -EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3}\bigg|_{x = L} = F\,
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively we can represent the point load as a distribution using the Dirac function.  In that case the equation and boundary conditions are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  &amp; EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} = F \delta(x - L) \\
  &amp; w|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d} x}\bigg|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad; \quad
  \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0\,
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that shear force boundary condition (third derivative) is removed, otherwise there would be a contradiction. These are equivalent [[boundary value problem]]s, and both yield the solution

:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{F}{6 EI}(3 L x^2 - x^3)\,~.&lt;/math&gt;

The application of several point loads at different locations will lead to &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; being a piecewise function. Use of the Dirac function greatly simplifies such situations; otherwise the beam would have to be divided into sections, each with four boundary conditions solved separately. A well organized family of functions called [[Singularity function]]s are often used as a shorthand for the Dirac function, its [[derivative]], and its [[antiderivatives]].

Dynamic phenomena can also be modeled using the static beam equation by choosing appropriate forms of the load distribution. As an example, the free [[vibration]] of a beam can be accounted for by using the load function:

:&lt;math&gt;q(x, t) = \mu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[linear mass density]] of the beam, not necessarily a constant. With this time-dependent loading, the beam equation will be a [[partial differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( EI \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} \right) = -\mu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting example describes the deflection of a beam rotating with a constant [[angular frequency]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;q(x) = \mu \omega^2 w(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[centripetal force]] distribution. Note that in this case, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the displacement (the dependent variable), and the beam equation will be an autonomous [[ordinary differential equation]].

== Examples ==

=== Three-point bending ===
The [[three point flexural test|three point bending test]] is a classical experiment in mechanics. It represents the case of a beam resting on two roller supports and subjected to a concentrated load applied in the middle of the beam.  The shear is constant in absolute value: it is half the central load, P / 2. It changes sign in the middle of the beam. The bending moment varies linearly from one end, where it is 0, and the center where its absolute value is PL / 4, is where the risk of rupture is the most important.
The deformation of the beam is described by a polynomial of third degree over a half beam (the other half being symmetrical).

|}

Solutions for several other commonly encountered configurations are readily available in textbooks on mechanics of materials and engineering handbooks.

=== Statically indeterminate beams ===
The [[bending moment]]s and [[shear force]]s in Euler–Bernoulli beams can often be determined directly using static balance of [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moments]].  However, for certain boundary conditions, the number of reactions can exceed the number of independent equilibrium equations.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;  Such beams are called ''[[statically indeterminate]]''.

The built-in beams shown in the figure below are statically indeterminate.  To determine the stresses and deflections of such beams, the most direct method is to solve the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation with appropriate boundary conditions.  But direct analytical solutions of the beam equation are possible only for the simplest cases.  Therefore, additional techniques such as linear superposition are often used to solve statically indeterminate beam problems.

The superposition method involves adding the solutions of a number of statically determinate problems which are chosen such that the boundary conditions for the sum of the individual problems add up to those of the original problem.

|}

Another commonly encountered statically indeterminate beam problem is the [[cantilever|cantilevered beam]] with the free end supported on a roller.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;  The bending moments, shear forces, and deflections of such a beam are listed below.

== Extensions ==

The kinematic assumptions upon which the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is founded allow it to be extended to more advanced analysis.  Simple superposition allows for three-dimensional transverse loading.  Using alternative [[constitutive equation]]s can allow for [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] or [[plastic bending|plastic]] beam deformation.  Euler–Bernoulli beam theory can also be extended to the analysis of curved beams, [[Buckling|beam buckling]], composite beams, and geometrically nonlinear beam deflection.

Euler–Bernoulli beam theory does not account for the effects of transverse [[Shear stress|shear]] strain.  As a result, it underpredicts deflections and overpredicts natural frequencies.  For thin beams (beam length to thickness ratios of the order 20 or more) these effects are of minor importance.  For thick beams, however, these effects can be significant.  More advanced beam theories such as the [[Timoshenko beam theory]] (developed by the Russian-born scientist [[Stephen Timoshenko]]) have been developed to account for these effects.

=== Large deflections ===
[[File:EulerBernoulliBeam.png|right|thumb|400px|Euler–Bernoulli beam]]
The original Euler–Bernoulli theory is valid only for [[infinitesimal strain theory|infinitesimal strains]] and small rotations.  The theory can be extended in a straightforward manner to problems involving moderately large rotations provided that the strain remains small by using the [[Theodore von Kármán|von Kármán]] strains.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;Reddy, J. N., (2007), ''Nonlinear finite element analysis'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euler–Bernoulli hypotheses that plane sections remain plane and normal to the axis of the beam lead to displacements of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
v_1 = v_0(x) - z \cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x} ~;~~v_2 = 0 ~;~~ v_3 = w_0(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the definition of the Lagrangian Green strain from [[finite strain theory]], we can find the ''von Karman strains'' for the beam that are valid for large rotations but small strains.  These strains have the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{dx_1} - x_3\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1^2} +
\frac{1}{2}\left[
\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}-x_3\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1^2}\right)^2 +
 \left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right)^2\right] \\
\varepsilon_{22} &amp; = 0 \\
\varepsilon_{33} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right)^2 \\
\varepsilon_{23} &amp; = 0 \\
\varepsilon_{31} &amp; =
\frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}-\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right) -
 \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}-x_3\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1^2}\right)
 \left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right)\right] \\
\varepsilon_{12} &amp; = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
From the [[principle of virtual work]], the balance of forces and moments in the beams gives us the equilibrium equations
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}N_{xx}}{\mathrm{d}x} + f(x) &amp; = 0 \\
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2M_{xx}}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + q(x) +
 \cfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(N_{xx}\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x}\right) &amp; = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the axial load, &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the transverse load, and
:&lt;math&gt;
N_{xx} = \int_A \sigma_{xx}~ \mathrm{d}A  ~;~~ M_{xx}  = \int_A z\sigma_{xx}~ \mathrm{d}A
&lt;/math&gt;
To close the system of equations we need the [[constitutive equations]] that relate stresses to strains (and hence stresses to displacements).  For large rotations and small strains these relations are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
N_{xx} &amp; =
 A_{xx}\left[\cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{dx} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2 \right] -
 B_{xx}\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x^2} \\
M_{xx} &amp; =
 B_{xx}\left[\cfrac{du_0}{\mathrm{d}x} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2 \right] -
 D_{xx}\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{xx}  = \int_A E~\mathrm{d}A ~;~~ B_{xx}  = \int_A zE~\mathrm{d}A ~;~~ D_{xx}  = \int_A z^2E~\mathrm{d}A ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The quantity &lt;math&gt;A_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[stiffness|extensional stiffness]]'',&lt;math&gt;B_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; is the coupled ''extensional-bending stiffness'', and &lt;math&gt;D_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[bending stiffness]]''.

For the situation where the beam has a uniform cross-section and no axial load, the governing equation for a large-rotation Euler–Bernoulli beam is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:400px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   EI~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d}x^4} - \frac{3}{2}~EA~\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\right) = q(x)
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Languages exploring the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==

===Constructed languages===
* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression. The people of Ascia were reduced to speaking only with their masters' voice; but they had made of it a new tongue, and I had no doubt, after hearing the Ascian, that by it he could express whatever thought he wished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Gene |year=1998 |title=The book of the new sun |publisher=SFBC |location=New York |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3638">{{Merge to|Equal-loudness contour|date=April 2018|discuss=Talk:Equal-loudness_contour#Merge_from_Fletcher–Munson_curves}}
[[File:Lindos4.svg|400px|right]]

The '''Fletcher–Munson curves''' are one of many sets of [[equal-loudness contour]]s for the human ear, determined experimentally by [[Harvey Fletcher]] and Wilden A. Munson, and reported in a 1933 paper entitled "Loudness, its definition, measurement and calculation" in the ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America''.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, H. and Munson, W.A. "Loudness, its definition, measurement and calculation", ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'' 5, 82-108 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The first research on the topic of how the ear hears different frequencies at different levels was conducted by Fletcher and Munson in 1933. Until recently, it was common to see the term ''Fletcher–Munson'' used to refer to equal-loudness contours generally, even though a re-determination was carried out by Robinson and Dadson in 1956, which became the basis for an ISO 226 standard.

It is now better to use the generic term [[equal-loudness contours]], of which the Fletcher-Munsons curves are now a sub-set,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Fletcher Munson Curve: The Equal Loudness Contour of Human Hearing | url =https://ledgernote.com/columns/mixing-mastering/fletcher-munson-curve/ |website = Ledger Note | accessdate = November 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially since a 2003 survey by ISO redefined the curves in a new standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |title=ISO 226:2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000000/http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ISO report, the Robinson–Dadson results were the odd one out, differing more from the current standard than did the Fletcher Munson curves. The report states that it is fortunate that the 40-[[phon]] Fletcher–Munson curve on which the [[A-weighting]] standard was based turns out to have been in agreement with modern determinations.

The article also comments on the large differences apparent in the low-frequency region, which remain unexplained. Possible explanations are:

* The equipment used was not properly calibrated.
* The criteria used for judging equal loudness at different frequencies had differed.
* Subjects were not properly rested for days in advance, or were exposed to loud noise in traveling to the tests which tensed the [[tensor tympani]] and [[stapedius muscle]]s controlling low-frequency mechanical coupling.

In [[development studies]], the concept of a [[value chain]] has been used to analyse [[international trade]] in global value chains which comprises “the full range of activities that are required to bring a product from its conception, through its design, its sourced raw materials and intermediate inputs, its marketing, its distribution and its support to the final consumer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvaluechains.org/concept-tools|title=Concept &amp; Tools - Global Value Chains|website=Globalvaluechains.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, when activities must be coordinated across geographies, the term '''global value chain''' ('''GVC''') is used in the development literature. Simply put, the global value chain includes all of the people and activities involved in the production of a good or service and its global level supply, distribution and post sales activities (also known as the [[supply chain]]). GVC is similar to [[Value_chain#Industry-level|Industry Level Value Chain]] but encompasses operations at the global level.

== In development ==
The first references to the GVC concept date from the mid-1990s and were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for [[Developing country|developing countries]] that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, the pioneer in value chain analysis, [[Gary Gereffi]], describes a process of almost ‘natural’ learning and upgrading for the firms that joined GVCs.&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G., (1994). The Organisation of Buyer-Driven Global Commodity Chains: How US Retailers Shape Overseas Production Networks. In G. Gereffi, and M. Korzeniewicz (Eds), Commodity Chains and Global Capitalism. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; This echoed the ‘export-led’ discourse of the [[World Bank]] in the ‘[[East Asian Miracle]]’ report based on the East Asian ‘[[Four Asian Tigers|Tigers]]’ success.

This encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises ([[Multinational corporation|MNE]]) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge.

Wider adoption of [[open source hardware]] technology used for [[digital fabrication]] such as [[3D printers]] like the [[RepRap]] has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization) and thus disrupt global value chains.&lt;ref&gt; André O. Laplume, Bent Petersen, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/27224636/Global_Value_Chains_from_a_3D_Printing_Perspective  Global value chains from a 3D printing perspective],  ''Journal of International Business Studies'' 47(5), 595–609 (2016). doi:10.1057/jibs.2015.47 &lt;/ref&gt;

GVC analysis views “upgrading” as a continuum starting with “process upgrading” (e.g. a producer adopts better technology to improve efficiency), then moves on to “product upgrading” where the quality or functionality of the product is upgraded by using higher quality material or a better quality management system ([[Quality management system|QMS]]), and then on to “functional upgrading” in which the firm begins to design its own product and develops marketing and branding capabilities and begins to supply to end markets/customers directly - often by targeting geographies or customers which are not served by its existing multinational clients). Subsequently, the process of upgrading might also cover inter-sectoral upgrading.&lt;ref name="Humphrey and Schmitz (2004)"&gt;Humphrey, J., and H. Schmitz. 2004. "Chain Governance and Upgrading: Taking Stock". in ''Local Enterprises in the Global Economy'', edited by H. Schmitz, 349–82. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;

This upgrading process in GVCs has been challenged by other researchers – some of whom argue that insertion in global value chains does not always lead to upgrading. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, J. and Schmitz, H. (2000). Governance and Upgrading: Linking Industrial Cluster and Global Value Chain. IDS Working Paper 120, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the expected upgrading process might not hold for all types of upgrading. Specifically they argue upgrading into design, marketing and branding might be hindered by exporting under certain conditions because MNEs have no interest in transferring these core skills to their suppliers thus preventing them from accessing global markets (except as a supplier) for first world customer.

=== Current research on governance and its impact from a development perspective ===
There are motivations behind renewed interest in global value chains and the opportunities that they may present for countries in [[South Asia]]. A 2013 report found that looking at the production chain, rather than the individual stages of production, is more helpful. Individual donors with their own priorities and expertise cannot be expected to provide comprehensive response to the needs identified, not to mention the legal responsibilities of many specialist agencies. The research suggests they adjust their priorities and modalities to the way production chains operate, and to coordinate with other donors to cover all trade needs. It calls for donors and governments to work together to assess how aid flows may affect power relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jodie Keane|date=2014|title=''Aid for trade and Global Value Chains: Issues for South Asia''|url=http://www.sawtee.org/publications/Policy-Brief-26.pdf|format=PDF|website=Sawtee.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 paper, Gereffi identified two major types of [[governance]]. The first were buyer-driven chains, where the lead firms are final buyers such as retail chains and branded product producers such as non-durable final consumer products (e.g., clothing, footwear and food). The second governance type identified by Gereffi were producer-driven chains. Here the technological competences of the lead firms (generally upstream in the chain) defined the chain’s competitiveness.

Current research suggests that GVCs exhibit a variety of characteristics and impact communities in a variety of ways. In a paper that emerged from the deliberations of the GVC Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, and Timothy Sturgeon, “The governance of global value chains,” ''Review of International Political Economy'', vol. 12, no. 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; five GVC governance patterns were identified:
* '''Hierarchical''' chains represent the fully internalised operations of [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] firms.
* '''Quasi-hierarchical''' (or '''captive''' chains) involve suppliers or intermediate customers with low levels of capabilities, who require high levels of support and are the subject of well-developed supply chain management from lead firms (often called the chain governor).
* '''Relational''' and '''modular''' chain governance exhibit durable relations between lead firms and their suppliers and customers in the chain, but with low levels of chain governance often because the main suppliers in the chain possess their own unique competences (and/or infrastructure) and can operate independently of the lead firm.
* '''Market''' chains represent the classic arms length relationships found in many [[Commodity market|commodity markets]].

As capabilities in many low- and middle-income economies have grown, chain governance has tended to move away from quasi-hierarchical models toward modular type as this form of governance reduces the costs of supply chain management and allows chain governors to maintain a healthy level of competition in their supply chains. However, whilst it maintains short-term competition in the supply chain, it has allowed some leading intermediaries to develop considerable functional competences (e.g., design and branding). In the long term these have the potential to emerge as competitors to their original chain governor (Kaplinski, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplinsky, R. (2010), The Role of Standards in Global Value Chains and their Impact on Economic and Social Upgrading, Policy Research Paper 5396, World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical concepts often considered firms as operating in a single value chain (with a single customer). Whilst this was often the case in quasi-hierarchical chains (with considerable customer power) it has become apparent that some firms operate in multiple value chains (subject to multiple forms of governance) and serve both national and international markets and that this plays a role in the development of firm capabilities (Navas-Aleman, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Navas - Aleman, L. (2011) “The Impact of Operating in Multiple Value Chains for Upgrading: The Case of the Brazilian Furniture and Footwear Industries” World Development Vol. 39(8), pp. 1386 – 1397&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNCTAD]], 2013).&lt;ref name="unctad.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2013_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=World Investment Report 2013: Global Value Chains: Investment and Trade for Development|website=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary of Unctad report: global value chains and development ===
In 2013, [[UNCTAD]] published two reports on GVCs and their contribution to development. They concluded &lt;ref name="unctad.org"/&gt; that:
* GVCs make a significant contribution to international development. Value-added trade contributes about 30% to the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of developing countries, significantly more than it does in developed countries (18%) furthermore the level of participation in GVCs is associated with stronger levels of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita growth]]. GVCs thus have a direct impact on the economy, employment and income and create opportunities for development. They can also be an important mechanism for [[Developing country|developing countries]] to enhance productive capacity, by increasing the rate of adoption of technology and through workforce skill development, thus building the foundations for long-term industrial upgrading.
* However, there are limitations to the GVC approach. Their contribution to the growth may be limited if the work done in-country is relatively low value adding (i.e. contributes only a small part of the total value added for the product or service). In addition there is no automatic process that guarantees diffusion of technology, skill-building and upgrading. Developing countries thus face the risk of operating in permanently low value-added activities. Finally, there are potential negative impacts on the environment and social conditions, including: poor workplace conditions, occupational safety and health, and job security. The relative ease with which the Value Chain Governors can relocate their production (often to lower cost countries) also create additional risks.
* Countries need to carefully assess the pros and cons of GVC participation and the costs and benefits of proactive policies to promote GVCs or GVC-led development strategies. Promoting GVC participation implies targeting specific GVC segments and GVC participation can only form one part of a country’s overall development strategy.
* Before promoting GVC participation, policymakers should evaluate their countries’ trade profiles and industrial capabilities in order to select strategic GVC development paths. Achieving upgrading opportunities through CVCs requires a structured approach that includes:
** embedding GVCs in industrial development policies (e.g. targeting GVC tasks and activities);  
** enabling GVC growth by providing the right framework conditions for trade and FDI and by putting in place the needed infrastructure; and 
** developing firm capabilities and training the local workforce.

==Gender and global value chains==
Gender plays a prominent role in global value chains, because it influences consumption patterns within the United States, and thus affects production on a larger scale. In turn, specific roles within the value chain are also determined by gender, making gender a key component in the process as well.

Within the global value chains, it is often women who work in the weakest or most disadvantaged chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Bruce|title=Economic Inequality for Women Costs $9tn Globally, study finds|work=The Guardian|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=Globalization and Its Discontents|date=1998|publisher=New Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natsuda|first1=Kaoru|last2=Goto|first2=Kenta|last3=Thoburn|first3=John|title=Challenges To The Cambodian Garment  Industry In The Global Garment Value Chain|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=469–493|doi=10.1057/ejdr.2010.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrientos|first1=Stephanie|title=Gender, Flexibility and Global Value Chain|journal=IDS Bulletin|date=22 May 2009|issue=32|pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr et al. argue that “the vast majority of subcontract workers or industrial homeworkers, who earn some of the lowest wages worldwide, are women.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="869">A '''headquarters unit''' is a specialised [[military unit]] formed around the [[headquarters]] of a  [[commanding officer]] and the requirements of that position. As such, a headquarters unit is always a component of a larger unit.

Examples include:
* headquarters [[regiment]], which usually controls a brigade, division or larger unit;
* headquarters [[battalion]]  (controlling a regiment, brigade or larger unit);
* headquarters [[company (military unit)]] (controlling a battalion);
* headquarters [[platoon]] (controlling a company) 

Specific examples include:
* [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|Headquarters and Headquarters Company (US Army)]]
* [[Headquarters and Service Company]] (US Marine Corps)

'''Home automation''' or '''domotics'''&lt;ref name="t3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Jim|title=The smart home: a glossary guide for the perplexed|url=http://www.t3.com/features/the-smart-home-guide|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=T3|date=12 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[building automation]] for a home, called a '''smart home''' or '''smart house'''. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Home Automation System - Consumer Reports |url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/06/run-your-home-from-your-phone/index.htm |website=www.consumerreports.org|access-date=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the [[Internet of Things]].

A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or "gateway"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Smart Meter and Smart House Integrated to an IdM and Key-based Scheme for Providing Integral Security for a Smart Grid ICT |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11036-017-0960-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[user interface]]  for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface, that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.

While there are many competing vendors, there are very few worldwide accepted industry standards and the smart home space is heavily fragmented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3038442/elasticity/5-open-source-home-automation-projects-we-love|title=5 Open Source Home Automation Projects We Love|date=2014-12-01|newspaper=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers often prevent independent implementations by withholding documentation and by litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wireless Sensor Networks: Concepts, Applications, Experimentation and Analysis |date=2016 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYmwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;source=bl&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;f=false |isbn=9811004129 |quote=The use of standardized, with [[open standard]]s over [[proprietary protocol]]s provides the industry with the freedom to choose between suppliers with guaranteed interoperability.

The home automation market was worth US$5.77 billion in 2013, predicted to reach a market value of US$12.81 billion by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/research-and-markets-idUSnBw195490a+100+BSW20150119 |title=Research and Markets: Global Home Automation and Control Market 2014-2020 - Lighting Control, Security &amp; Access Control, HVAC Control Analysis of the $5.77 Billion Industry |date=2015-01-19 |newspaper=Reuters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505124414/https://www.reuters.com/article/research-and-markets-idUSnBw195490a%2B100%2BBSW20150119 |archivedate=2016-05-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Early home automation began with labour-saving machines. Self-contained electric or gas powered [[home appliances]] became viable in the 1900s with the introduction of [[electric power distribution]]&lt;ref name="gerhart"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1|title = Home Automation &amp; Wiring|url =|publisher = McGraw-Hill/TAB Electronics|date = 1999-03-31|location = New York|isbn = 9780070246744|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the introduction of [[washing machine]]s (1904), [[water heater]]s (1889), [[refrigerator]]s, [[sewing machine]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s.

In 1975, the first general purpose home automation network technology, [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]], was developed. It is a communication protocol for electronic devices. It primarily uses [[electric power transmission]] wiring for signalling and control, where the signals involve brief [[radio frequency]] bursts of [[digital data]], and remains the most widely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hometoys.com/emagazine.php?url=/htinews/oct99/articles/rye/rye.htm|title = My Life at X10|date = October 1999|accessdate = October 8, 2014|website = AV and Automation Industry eMagazine|publisher = AV and Automation Industry eMagazine|last = Rye|first = Dave|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140930080338/http://hometoys.com/emagazine.php?url=%2Fhtinews%2Foct99%2Farticles%2Frye%2Frye.htm|archivedate = September 30, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, X10 products included a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.

By 2012, in the United States, according to ABI Research, 1.5 million home automation systems were installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abiresearch.com/press/15-million-home-automation-systems-installed-in-th/|title=1.5 Million Home Automation Systems Installed in the US This Year|website=www.abiresearch.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Li et al. (2016) there are three generations of home automation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Rita Yi Man|last2=Li|first2=Herru Ching Yu|last3=Mak|first3=Cho Kei|last4=Tang|first4=Tony Beiqi|title=Sustainable Smart Home and Home Automation: Big Data Analytics Approach|url=http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSH/vol10_no8_2016/18.pdf|journal=International Journal of Smart Home|volume=10|issue=8|pages=177–198|doi=10.14257/ijsh.2016.10.8.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# First generation: wireless technology with proxy server, e.g. ZigBee automation;
# Second generation: artificial intelligence controls electrical devices, e.g. Amazon Echo;
# Third generation: robot buddy who interacts with humans, e.g. Robot Rovio, Roomba.

The word "''domotics''" (and "''domotica''" when used as a verb) is a contraction of the Latin word for a home (''[[domus]]'') and the word ''[[robotics]]''.&lt;ref name="t3"/&gt;

== Applications and technologies ==
* [[HVAC|Heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC): it is possible to have remote control of all [[home energy monitor]]s over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preville|first1=Cherie|title=Control Your Castle: The Latest in HVAC Home Automation|url=http://www.achrnews.com/articles/124160-control-your-castle-the-latest-in-hvac-home-automation|accessdate=15 Jun 2015|work=ACHRNews|publisher=ACHRNews|date=26 Aug 2013|ref=ACHRNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asadullah|first1=Muhammad|title= An Overview of Home Automation Systems|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7791223/|accessdate=22 Dec 2016|work=Conference Paper|publisher=IEEE|date=22 Dec 2016|ref=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Indoor positioning system]]s  (IPS).    
* [[Home automation for the elderly and disabled]]
* Pet and Baby  Care, for example tracking the pets and babies' movements and controlling pet access rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smarthomegeeks.co.uk/news/smart-cat-flap/|title=Sure Flap - Smart Cat Flap Coming Soon! - News - Smart Home Geeks|date=2017-04-06|work=Smart Home Geeks|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air quality control.

In a review of home automation devices, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' found two main concerns for consumers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/06/run-your-home-from-your-phone/index.htm|title=Best Home Automation System - Consumer Reports|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Wi-Fi network connected to the internet can be vulnerable to hacking.
* Technology is still in its infancy, and consumers could invest in a system that becomes [[abandonware]]. In 2014, Google bought the company selling the Revolv Hub home automation system, integrated it with [[Nest Labs|Nest]] and in 2016 shut down the servers Revolv Hub depended on, rendering the hardware useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/googles-nest-closing-smart-home-company-revolv-bricking-devices-2016-4|title=Google's parent company is deliberately disabling some of its customers' old smart-home devices|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Microsoft Research]] found in 2011, that home automation could involve high cost of ownership, inflexibility of interconnected devices, and poor manageability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brush|first=A. J.|last2=Lee|first2=Bongshin|last3=Mahajan|first3=Ratul|last4=Agarwal|first4=Sharad|last5=Saroiu|first5=Stefan|last6=Dixon|first6=Colin|date=2011-05-01|title=Home Automation in the Wild: Challenges and Opportunities|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/home-automation-in-the-wild-challenges-and-opportunities/|journal=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically systems have been sold as complete systems where the consumer relies on one vendor for the entire system including the hardware, the communications protocol, the central hub, and the user interface. However, there are now [[open hardware]] and [[Open-source model|open source software]] systems which can be used instead of or with proprietary hardware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism and controversies ==
Home automation suffers from [[platform fragmentation]] and lack of [[technical standard]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mobileworldlive.com/mwc16-articles/iot-experts-fret-over-fragmentation/|title=IoT experts fret over fragmentation - Mobile World Live|date=2016-02-25|newspaper=Mobile World Live|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2016/02/19/fragmentation-enemy-internet-things|title=Fragmentation is the enemy of the Internet of Things {{!}} Qualcomm|date=2016-02-19|newspaper=Qualcomm|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/internet-of-things-opportunities-and-challenges-for-semiconductor-companies|title=Internet of Things: Opportunities and challenges for semiconductor companies|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.com/zh/files/event/ATF2015SZ_A6_Thundersoft.pdf |title=IOT Brings Fragmentation in Platform |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.w3.org/Talks/2016/04-27-countering-fragmentation.pdf Countering Fragmentation with the Web of Things&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/android-fragmentation-report-2013-7 |title=Android Fragmentation Report |publisher=Business Insider |date=July 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a situation where the variety of home automation devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology [[ecosystem]]s hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/who-needs-internet-things|title=Who Needs the Internet of Things?|website=Linux.com {{!}} The source for Linux information|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers may be hesitant to bet their IoT future on [[proprietary software]] or hardware devices that use [[proprietary protocol]]s that may fade or become difficult to customize and interconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/NEWS/21-OPEN-SOURCE-PROJECTS-IOT|title=21 Open Source Projects for IoT|website=Linux.com {{!}} The source for Linux information|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of home automation devices can also be a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices.&lt;ref name="Goodbye, Android"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/goodbye-android|title=Goodbye, Android|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice|last1=Franceschi-Bicchierai|first1=Lorenzo|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-android-toxic-hellstew-survival-guide/|title=The toxic hellstew survival guide|website=ZDnet|last1=Kingsley-Hughes|first1=Adrian|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active devices vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-security-a-market-for-lemons-that-leaves-87-percent-insecure/|title=Android security a 'market for lemons' that leaves 87 percent vulnerable|date=2015-10-13|website=zdnet.com|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|first1=Liam|last1=Tung|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~drt24/papers/spsm-scoring.pdf|title=Security Metrics for the Android Ecosystem|last2=Beresford|first2=Alastair R.|publisher=[[Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge]]|doi=10.1145/2808117.2808118|last3=Rice|first3=Andrew|first1=Daniel R.|last1=Thomas|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Do You Spell God?: Answers to the Big Questions from Around the World''''' is a book on religion by [[Rabbi Marc Gellman]] and [[Msgr. Thomas Hartman]] of ''[[The God Squad (Telecare)|The God Squad]]'', which answers questions about different religions. Each chapter's title is a question about any religion in general; for example, one chapter asks "What are some of the bad things in religions?", another asks "What question does each religion want to answer the most?", and another asks "What's a religion?".

== Foreword ==

A prologue written by the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] introduces us to the book itself, and he tells people what to expect as they read it. He describes the connection between religion and happiness, and the importance of peace and tolerance in the world among people of different faiths.

== Consumer Warning! ==

Rabbi Gellman and Msgr. Hartman give the reader a warning that if he/she takes religion very seriously, and if it seems to be disrespectful or funny in the wrong way, then it's the wrong book, and that their intent is to be serious and funny.

== Response ==
The book was recognized with the [[Christopher Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wchstv.com/abc/gma/godsquad.shtml Rabbi Marc Gellman and Msgr. Thomas Hartman: The God Squad on Good Morning America], [[WCHS-TV]], accessed April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors were featured as animated characters in an [[HBO]] special based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3617/is_199611/ai_n8754105 "Heads up!: TV tips"], ''NEA Today'', November 1996, accessed April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics''' (ITEP; [[Russian language|Russian]] Институт теоретической и экспериментальной физики) is a multi-disciplinary research center located in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. ITEP carries out research in the fields of theoretical and mathematical physics, astrophysics, high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, plasma physics, solid state physics, nanotechnology, reactor and accelerator physics, medical physics, and computer science. ITEP also maintains an extensive educational program and organizes physics schools for scholars and undergraduates. The institute occupies part of the former estate "Cheryomushki-Znamenskoye" - a monument of architecture and landscape art of the 18th-19th centuries.

== History ==
ITEP was established on December 1, 1945, initially carrying the name "Laboratory №3", with the purpose of conceiving a heavy water nuclear reactor and cosmic ray studies. Developed of the theoretical part [[KS 150]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itepnew.itep.ru/index.php/ob-institute/istoriya/item/66-kratkaya-istoricheskaya-spravka |title=Краткая историческая справка |accessdate=2018-09-26 |website=НИЦ «Курчатовский институт» — ИТЭФ }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the years the institute expanded its research programme into high energy particle physics, astrophysics, medical physics and other related fields.

== Research ==
The school conducts original scientific research in several fields of physics and technology. Research areas in theoretical physics concentrate around [[quantum field theory]] including the [[string theory]]. Experimental research includes active participation in large international projects, such as the [[CERN]]'s [[LHC]] experiments, as well as smaller, national and locally managed projects.

== 2012 controversy ==
A large group of scientists at the ITEP are protesting about the Russian government's plan to merge ITEP with the [[Kurchatov Institute]]. According to them, the real purpose of the move is to effectively "kill" ITEP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/russian-physicists-protest-government-consolidation-1.9921 ''Russian physicists protest government consolidation. Restrictive policies are affecting international collaboration''], Nature, 27 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust''' is an [[industrial heritage]] organisation which runs ten [[museum]]s and manages 35 historic sites within the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], England, widely considered as the birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The Gorge includes a number of settlements important to industrial history and with heritage assets, including [[Ironbridge]], [[Coalport]] and [[Jackfield]] along the [[River Severn]], and also [[Coalbrookdale]] and [[Broseley]]. The area is a [[World Heritage Site]] (since 1986) and an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH).

==Museums==
The ten museum sites run by the Trust, collectively known as the '''Ironbridge Gorge Museums''' are:

# [[Blists Hill Victorian Town]], including the [[Hay Inclined Plane]]
# [[Broseley Pipeworks]]
# [[Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron]]
# [[Coalport China Museum]]
# [[Coalport Tar Tunnel]]
# [[Darby Houses]]
# [[Enginuity]]
# [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge and Tollhouse]]
# [[Jackfield Tile Museum]]
# [[Museum of the Gorge, Ironbridge|Museum of the Gorge]]

==The Trust==
Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust was established in 1968&lt;ref name="Trinder, 242" &gt;{{Cite book
  |title=The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire
  |last=Trinder  |first=Barrie
  |origyear=1973

  |publisher=Phillimore
  |ref={{harvid|Trinder|1981}}
  |page=242
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve and interpret the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the Ironbridge Gorge. It is an independent educational [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|503717|Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 it absorbed the Coalbrookdale Museum, now the Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron, which had been established in 1959.&lt;ref name="Trinder, 242" /&gt;

Its present CEO is Anna Brennand, who took over from Steve Miller in 2013. Previous CEOs have included [[Stuart Smith (archaeologist)|Stuart Smith]] and [[Sir Neil Cossons]], both well-respected experts on industrial history and archaeology.

The museum staff manage 35 historic sites within the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site, including ten museums. The sites also include archaeological sites, two chapels, housing, two [[Quaker]] burial grounds, a research library, a tourist information centre, woodland, and two [[youth hostel]]s.

For over 20 years the museum has had a wide-ranging and innovative archaeology unit&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ironbridge.org.uk/our-story/sector-support/archaeology/ Ironbridge Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; which originally undertook archaeological work within the Ironbridge Gorge and throughout the country, although it now concentrates its work within the Ironbridge Gorge. 



==Ironbridge Institute==
The Trust also runs the [[Ironbridge Institute]] in Coalbrookdale, a centre offering postgraduate and professional courses in heritage, in partnership with the [[University of Birmingham]].

'''Jelly''' was an [[application software|app]] that served as a Q&amp;A platform, created by '''Jelly Industries''', a [[search-engine]] company founded and led by [[Biz Stone]], one of [[Twitter]]'s co-founders.&lt;ref name=wsj-acquire-jelly/&gt; In March 2017, Jelly was acquired by [[Pinterest]] for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fingas|first1=Jon|title=Pinterest acquires Jelly, the startup from Twitter's Biz Stone|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/08/pinterest-acquires-jelly/|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=[[Engadget]]|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jelly differentiates itself from other Q&amp;A platforms such as [[Quora]] and [[ChaCha (search engine)|ChaCha]] by relying on visual imagery to steer people to getting better answers from within and outside their social networks. In particular, it encourages people to use photos to ask questions.&lt;ref name=jelly-announcement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.jelly.co/post/72563498393/introducing-jelly|title = Introducing Jelly|date = January 7, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''Jelly'' blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/jelly-biz-stones-new-qa-platform-will-go-live-today/|title = Jelly, Biz Stone’s New Q&amp;A Platform, Uses Images To Find Answers|last = Lunden|first = Ingrid|date = January 7, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''[[AllThingsD]]'' reported on March 28, 2013 that, according to sources, [[Twitter]] co-founder [[Biz Stone]] was close to launching a native mobile app called Jelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20130328/sweet-biz-stone-is-poised-to-launch-new-mobile-startup-called-jelly/|title = Sweet?

The '''Jungian interpretation of religion''', pioneered by [[Carl Jung]] and advanced by his followers, is an attempt to interpret [[religion]] in the light of [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]]. Unlike [[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers, Jungians tend to treat religious beliefs and behaviors in a positive light, while offering psychological referents to traditional religious terms such as "[[soul]]", "[[evil]]", "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]", "the [[sacred]]", and "[[God]]". Because beliefs do not have to be true in order for people to hold them, the Jungian interpretation of religion has been, and continues to be, of interest to psychologists and theists.

==Jungian psychology==
{{main|Analytical psychology}}
Jung established a school of [[psychology]] which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] components of the psyche) through a process called [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]. Through studying [[folklore]], world [[mythology|mythologies]], and the dreams of his patients, Jung identified these components of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as expressions of instinctual patterns (or [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]). The role of the [[psychoanalyst]] in the Jungian approach is to assist the analysand from being overwhelmed by unconscious material or being cut off from the meaning offered by these suprapersonal forces. Jungian analysts typically believe that the psyche is the source of healing and the drive toward individuation.

== Western religious tradition ==

Jung's assessment of [[Western religion]] arose both from his own experiences as well as from the psychotherapeutic work with his European clients. As a young man he had visions and dreams that were powerful and rich with meaning, yet he clung to Christianity. While he believed that God could "do stupendous things to me, things of fire and unearthly light", he was profoundly disappointed by his [[first communion]]—in his words, "nothing happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jaffe|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the same symptoms in his clients, namely, a fascination with the power of the unconscious, coupled with the inadequacy of Western religious symbols and rituals to represent this power. Summing up his analysis of the modern European situation he said: "Our age wants to experience the psyche for itself ... ''knowledge'', instead of ''faith''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1970a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jungian training analyst Murray Stein, Jung related theological and psychological constructs using three tenets:&lt;ref name="Stein_1990"&gt;{{harvp|Stein|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Theological elements (such as God) can be interpreted to refer to psychological concepts.
# Psychologists can evaluate the adequacy of theological constructs against the dynamics of the psyche.
# Words about the psyche are also words about God, due to the correspondence between [[subjectivity]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].

Thus, proceeding by tenet #1 in ''[[Answer to Job]]'', Jung interpreted [[Yahweh]] as an archaic form of the self, [[Book of Job|Job]] as the ego, and [[Satan]] as the principle of individuation. Jung interprets the evolution of the god-image portrayed in the [[Old Testamen|Old]] and [[New Testament]] as a process of psychological development: In the Book of Job, the archaic self is prompted to develop toward consciousness by the more conscious ego, a process attended by dreams and prophesies (e.g. the Old Testament prophets). The self enters ego-consciousness (the incarnation of God in [[Jesus]] of Nazareth), followed by the emergence of the transcendent function (when the Holy Ghost comes to the disciples at Pentecost).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "A Psychological Approach to the Doctrine of the Trinity", again by tenet #1 Jung interprets the Father as the self, the source of energy within the psyche; the Son as an emergent structure of consciousness that replaces the self-alienated ego; and the Holy Spirit as a mediating structure between the ego and the self.&lt;ref name="PaRWaE"&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1970b}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jung believed that the psyche moves toward completion in fours (made up of pairs of opposites), and that therefore (using tenet #3 above) the Christian formulation of the Trinity would give way to a quaternity by including missing aspects (e.g. the feminine and evil). (This analysis prompted Jung to send a congratulatory note to [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950 upon the adoption of the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], to wit completing the quaternity.)

== Eastern religious tradition ==

Jung wrote a number of books and articles about Eastern religions, including commentaries on the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', [[yoga]], and Eastern [[meditation]]. He also contributed forewords to books on [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Sadhu|Holy Men of India]], and the ''[[I Ching]]''.&lt;ref name="PaRWaE"/&gt;

==Gnosticism==
{{main|Gnosticism in modern times}}

Carl Jung and his associate [[G. R. S. Mead]] worked on trying to understand and explain the gnostic faith from a psychological standpoint. Jung's analytical psychology in many ways schematically mirrors ancient gnostic mythology, particularly those of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] and the 'classic' gnostic doctrine described in most detail in the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' (see [[Gnosticism#Major gnostic schools and their texts|gnostic schools]]).

Jung understands the emergence of the [[Demiurge]] out of the original, unified monadic source of the spiritual universe by gradual stages to be analogous to (and a symbolic depiction of) the emergence of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] from the unconscious. However, it is uncertain as to whether the similarities between Jung's psychological teachings and those of the Gnostics are due to their sharing a "[[perennial philosophy]]", or whether Jung was unwittingly influenced by the Gnostics in the formation of his theories. Jung's own 'gnostic hymn', the ''[[Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]'' (The Seven Sermons to the Dead), would tend to imply the latter, but after circulating the manuscript, Jung declined to publish it during his lifetime. Since it is not clear whether Jung was ultimately displeased with the book or whether he merely suppressed it as too controversial, the issue remains contested. Uncertain too are Jung's belief that the gnostics were aware of and intended psychological meaning or significance within their myths.

On the other hand, it is clear from a comparison of Jung's writings and that of ancient Gnostics, that Jung disagreed with them on the ultimate goal of the individual. Gnostics in ancient times clearly sought a return to a supreme, other-worldly [[Deity|Godhead]]. In a study of Jung, [[Robert Segal]] claimed that the eminent psychologist would have found the psychological interpretation of the goal of ancient Gnosticism (that is, re-unification with the [[Pleroma]], or the unknown God) to be psychically 'dangerous', as being a total identification with the unconscious. To contend that there is at least some disagreement between Jung and Gnosticism is at least supportable: the Jungian process of individuation involves the addition of unconscious psychic tropes to consciousness in order to achieve a trans-conscious centre to the personality. Jung did not intend this addition to take the form of a ''complete'' identification of the Self with the Unconscious.

== Extensions and criticisms ==
Edward F. Edinger systematized and extended Jung’s interpretation of the [[Judeo-Christian]] God, particularly in his book ''Ego and Archetype''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Edinger|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Wallace Clift]], an Episcopal priest, explored similarities between Jung’s vision of humanity as “a story of developing consciousness” with Christianity’s doctrine of “the Holy Spirit understood as present in each person. ... It is not a matter of making out each person a ‘God’, but on the contrary, realizing that within each person lies the potentiality of responding to God by bringing that encounter into consciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clift|1982|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further proposed the existence of a new post-Jungian archetype of ''pilgrimage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clift|Clift|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episcopal priest and Jungian analyst [[John A. Sanford]], interprets Jesus’ teachings from a Jungian perspective in his 1970 book ''The Kingdom Within'' in which he associates being a Pharisee with identifying with our mask or [[persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sanford|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interprets the Devil or temptation to sin as “the inner adversary”, the saying “love your enemies” as the dictate to discover and remove our projections from others, and advocates Jesus as the exemplar of human wholeness, uniting body, soul, spirit, sexuality, [[eros]], and meaning through love. Jungian analyst and professor of psychology and religion [[Robert L. Moore]] cites Christ as expressing four archetypes found in the male psyche: the Warrior (in wrestling with his inner demons in the desert and at Gethsemane);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1992a|pp=113, 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lover (in radicalizing the commandment to love our neighbors);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1993a|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Magician (in changing water to wine, feeding the thousands, and healing the sick);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1993b|pp=87, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the King (in generating the Kingdom of God, and in identifying himself with the way to the Father).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1992b|pp=101–105, 186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hillman]], founder of [[archetypal psychology]], has done much to expose the unacknowledged or shadow “Christianisms” within Jungian depth psychology itself, ''e.g.'' one barrier to grasping the underworld or domain of Hades as the psychic realm is Christ’s victory over death.&lt;ref name="Hillman_79"&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the model for viewing the shadow as a moral problem is the Christian doctrine of sin.&lt;ref name="Hillman_94"&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman believes that soul or interiority refers not only to humans but to inanimate objects and to the world.&lt;ref name="Hillman_94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|Venura|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman is critical of Jung’s convention of equating symbols of roundness (e.g. the [[rose window]] of a cathedral) with the Self, and discourages the attempt to achieve undivided wholeness by integrating parts. Jung’s Self (representing the inner God) derives from monotheism, and by contrast Hillman encourages a polytheistic perspective.&lt;ref name="Hillman_79"/&gt;

Fr. Victor White, an English Dominican theologian and priest, and Jung carried on a 15&amp;nbsp;year correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lammers|Cunningham|Stein|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through their dialog, White attempted to integrate analytical psychology into Catholic theology while Jung attempted to re-interpret Christian symbols. It was clear to White that “Jung was a psychiatrist and not a professional philosopher and/or theologian &amp;ndash; and that there were important theological issues which Jung seemed, for whatever reason, not to understand or to value”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Meckel|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unresolved point was White’s perspective that evil is the absence of good, whereas Jung believed that an adequate god image must include evil to balance the good. In addition, White floundered on Jung’s assumption that the Judeo-Christian god image changes over time, and that it would be replaced by something different in the distant future. In his 1994 book, [[Richard Noll]]  makes the case that Jung promoted his psychological theories as a pagan religion, and asserts that one cannot be both a Catholic and a Jungian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Noll|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent Jewish theologian and philosopher, [[Martin Buber]], had a lifelong interest in psychoanalysis, and may have attended the same ''Eranos'' conference with Jung in 1934. In 1952 Buber and Jung exchanged letters regarding a paper Buber had published entitled “Religion and Modern Thinking”. In his rejoinder, Buber claimed that Jung had strayed outside his realm of expertise into theology by asserting that God does not exist independent of the psyches of human beings. He concluded that Jung was “mystically deifying the instincts instead of hallowing them in faith”, which he called a “modern manifestation of Gnosis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Buber Agassi|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi R. Goldenberg, after reviewing Jung’s idea of archetypes as disembodied Platonic forms and on the damage done to women by the [[mind-body dichotomy]], suggests that “feminist theory radically depart from the Jungian archetype [and] from all systems of thought that posit transcendent, superhuman deities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goldenberg|1989|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; While rejecting this part of Jungian theory, she recommends that women can use Jung’s practice of [[active imagination]], or “dreaming the dream onward”, to form a satisfying psychospiritual community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goldenberg|1992|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Louise von Franz]]’ book analyzing the dreams of the dying concludes that “the unconscious ... prepares [us] not for a definite end but for a profound transformation and for a kind of continuation of the life process”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|von Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joins with Edinger in suggesting that some dreams cannot be adequately interpreted as symbolic representations of subjective inner processes, but are “metaphysical”, hinting at a reality that is deeply mysterious.

== History ==

[[File:Benbadhanabongse.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Prince Benbadhnabongse, the Prince of Phichai]]

In 1902, [[King Chulalongkorn]] attempted to promote the country's silk, silverware, and weaving industries. He hired Dr Kametaro Toyama from the [[University of Tokyo]], to train Siamese students in Japanese silk and weaving crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences [http://www.jircas.affrc.go.jp/english/publication/jarq/03-4/03-4-030-033.pdf "A Scientist and a Link of the Chain uniting Thailand and Japan"] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the School of Sericulture was founded at [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Thung Saladaeng]], [[Bangkok]] by [[Benbadhanabongse|Prince Benbadhanabongse]], the Director of the Department of Sericulture of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;กรมหม่อนไหม [http://qsds.go.th/newqsds/inside_page.php?pageid=10 ประวัติกรมหม่อนไหม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The school was renamed the School of Agriculture in 1906.

In 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture was founded at [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] as the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (Thailand)|Ministry of Agriculture]] merged three schools, the School of Surveying (founded in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand's first tertiary-level agriculture curriculum began to offer courses in 1909.

In 1917, Phraya Thepsartsatit and [[Chaophraya Thammasakmontri]] of the Ministry of Education founded the first primary school of agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture, named the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Horwang]]. It moved to [[Mueang Nakhon Pathom District|Tambon Phra Prathon]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ [http://pirun.ku.ac.th/~fedupst/Chapter4.pdf การพัฒนาอาชีวเกษตรกรรม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Sithiporn Kridakara|Prince Sithiporn Kridakara]] and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri together expanded the school regionally. In the central region, a campus was located in [[Saraburi Province]], in the northern region in [[Chiang Mai Province]], in the northeastern region in [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]], and in the southern region in [[Songkhla Province]].

[[File:Monuments_of_the_3_Masters_of_Kasetsart_University.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Statue of the Three Masters of Kasetsart University]]

In 1935, the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in each part of the country was closed and merged following the agricultural education policy in that time. Luang Ingkhasikasikan, Luang Suwan Vajokkasikij, and Phra Chuangkasetsinlapakan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/about/history_ku.html บุคคลสำคัญของมหาวิทยาลัย] เรียกดูวันที่ 2013-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; together proposed to maintain the Mae Jo School (today's [[Mae Jo University]]) at Chiang Mai Province only and renamed it Secondary-level Agriculture Technical School before it was elevated to the College of Agriculture, under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The Ministry of Agriculture established the Central Agriculture Station or "Kaset Klang", in [[Bang Khen District]], Bangkok. It caused the College of Agriculture to move to Bang Khen District in 1938 and the government office at Chiang Mai Province became [[Mae Jo University|Kasetsart Preparatory School]] to prepare students to study at the College of Agriculture in Bang Khen.

In 1943, [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] promoted the College of Agriculture and established Kasetsart University as a department of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The university consisted of four faculties: agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cooperatives (today's Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Business Administration).&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mom Luang Xujati Kambhu, the Fifth President of Kasetsart University, judged the Bang Khen campus too confined and unable to support the education in agricultural sciences called for by the National Social and Economics Development Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.psd.ku.ac.th/kuout/p013.html ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัย] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kamphaeng Saen District|Kamphaeng Saen campus]] was established on 12 November 1979 as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/newdesign/content_level.php?menulevel=22 ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัยทศวรรษที่สี่ พ.ศ. 2516-2525] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The university further expanded by establishing [[Si Racha District|Si Racha campus]], [[Sakon Nakhon Province|Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus]], [[Suphan Buri Province|Suphan Buri campus]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi campus]] and [[Lopburi Province|Lopburi campus]]. The university already established Si Racha campus in 1989&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.src.ku.ac.th/WebEng/index2.php?iPage=info/abCampus.html History of the Campus] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus on 15 August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.ku.ac.th/index.php/en/about-us/about-university/about-the-kucsc About KU.CSC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103165335/http://www.csc.ku.ac.th/index.php/en/about-us/about-university/about-the-kucsc |date=3 January 2017 }} Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2015, the Kasetsart University Act B.E. 2558 (2015) transformed it from a [[public university]] to a [[national university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/A/066/1.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๘] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nontri tree===
The [[Peltophorum pterocarpum|Nontri tree]] has been a symbol of Kasetsart University since 1963. The [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|king]] and [[Sirikit|queen]] planted nine Nontri trees in the front of Kasetsart University's main auditorium on 29 November 1963 which became historic day for Nisit Kasetsart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์: ต้นนนทรี] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082549/http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm |date=1 December 2010 }} Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nontri is a tree in the [[Fabaceae|Fabaceae family]]. It is a long-lived evergreen with grey-brown bark with upright branches. The leaves are [[bipinnate]] compound and the flowers are yellow, produced in large compound [[racemes]]. Its fruit is a pod containing seeds.

In [[computer science]], '''language-based security''' ('''LBS''') is a set of techniques that may be used to strengthen the security of applications on a high level by using the properties of programming languages.
LBS is considered to enforce computer security on an application-level, making it possible to prevent vulnerabilities which traditional operating system security is unable to handle.

[[Application software|Software applications]] are typically specified and implemented in certain [[programming language]]s, and in order to protect against attacks, flaws and bugs an application’s [[source code]] might be vulnerable to, there is a need for application-level security; security evaluating the applications behavior with respect to the programming language. This area is generally known as language-based security.

== Motivation ==
The use of large software systems, such as [[SCADA]], is taking place all around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can we learn from SCADA security incidents?|url=http://www.oas.org/cyber/documents/ENISA%20-%20Can%20we%20learn%20from%20SCADA%20security%20incidents%20-%20White%20Paper.pdf|website=www.oas.org|publisher=enisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computer systems constitute the core of many infrastructures. The society relies greatly on infrastructure such as water, energy, communication and transportation, which again all rely on fully functionally working computer systems. There are several well known examples of when critical systems fail due to bugs or errors in software, such as ''when shortage of computer memory caused LAX computers to crash and hundreds of flights to be delayed'' (April 30, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Air Traffic Control System Failed|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476246/malware-vulnerabilities/-2-billion-air-traffic-control-system-failed-by-running-out-of-computer-memo.html|accessdate=12 May 2014|publisher=www.computerworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Software Bug Contributed to Blackout|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8016|accessdate=11 February 2004|publisher=www.securityfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the mechanisms used to control the correct behavior of software are implemented at the operating system level. The operating system handles several possible security violations such as memory access violations, stack overflow violations, access control violations, and many others. This is a crucial part of security in computer systems, however by securing the behavior of software on a more specific level, even stronger security can be achieved. Since a lot of properties and behavior of the software is lost in compilation, it is significantly more difficult to detect vulnerabilities in machine code. By evaluating the source code, before the compilation, the theory and implementation of the programming language can also be considered, and more vulnerabilities can be uncovered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So why do developers keep making the same mistakes? Instead of relying on programmers' memories, we should strive to produce tools that codify what is known about common security vulnerabilities and integrate it directly into the development process."

— D. Evans and D. Larochelle, 2002
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objective of Language-based security ==
By using LBS, the security of software can be increased in several areas, depending on the techniques used. Common programming errors such as allowing [[buffer overflow]]s and illegal information flows to occur, can be detected and disallowed in the software used by the consumer. It is also desirable to provide some proof to the consumer about the security properties of the software, making the consumer able to trust the software without having to receive the source code and self checking it for errors.

A compiler, taking source code as input, performs several language specific operations on the code in order to translate it into machine readable code. [[Lexical analysis]], [[Preprocessor|preprocessing]], [[parsing]], [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]], [[Code generation (compiler)|code generation]], and [[code optimization]] are all commonly used operations in compilers. By analyzing the source code and using the theory and implementation of the language, the compiler will attempt to correctly translate the high-level code into low-level code, preserving the behavior of the program.

[[File:Model of certifying compiler.png|thumb|Illustrating a certifying compiler]]

During compilation of programs written in a [[Type safety|type-safe]] language, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the source code must type-check successfully before compilation. If the type-check fails, the compilation will not be performed, and the source code needs to be modified. This means that, given a correct compiler, any code compiled from a successfully type-checked source program should be clear of invalid assignment errors. This is information which can be of value to the code consumer, as it provides some degree of guarantee that the program will not crash due to some specific error.

A goal of LBS is to ensure the presence of certain properties in the source code corresponding to the safety policy of the software. Information gathered during the compilation can be used to create a certificate that can be provided to the consumer as a proof of safety in the given program. Such a proof must imply that the consumer can trust the compiler used by the supplier and that the certificate, the information about the source code, can be verified.

The figure illustrates how certification and verification of low-level code could be established by the use of a certifying compile. The software supplier gains the advantage of not having to reveal the source code, and the consumer is left with the task of verifying the certificate, which is an easy task compared to evaluation and compilation of the source code itself. Verifying the certificate only requires a limited trusted code base containing the compiler and the verifier.

== Techniques ==
=== Program analysis ===
{{Main|Program analysis}}
The main applications of [[program analysis]] are [[program optimization]] (running time, space requirements, power consumption etc.) and [[program correctness]] (bugs, security vulnerabilities etc.). Program analysis can be applied to compilation ([[static analysis]]), run-time ([[dynamic analysis]]), or both. In language-based security, program analysis can provide several useful features, such as: [[type checking]] (static and dynamic), [[reference monitor|monitoring]], [[taint checking]] and [[control-flow analysis]].

=== Information flow analysis ===
{{Main|Information flow (information theory)|l1=Information flow}}
Information flow analysis can be described as a set of tools used to analyze the [[Information flow (information theory)#Information flow control|information flow control]] in a program, in order to preserve [[confidentiality]] and [[Data integrity|integrity]] where regular [[access control]] mechanisms come short.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By decoupling the right to access information from the right to disseminate it, the flow model goes beyond the access matrix model in its ability to specify secure information flow. A practical system needs both access and flow control to satisfy all security requirements."

— D. Denning, 1976
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Access control enforces checks on ''access'' to information, but is not concerned about what happens after that. An example: A system has two users, Alice and Bob. Alice has a file ''secret.txt'', which is only allowed to be read and edited by her, and she prefers to keep this information to herself. In the system, there also exists a file ''public.txt'', which is free to read and edit for all users in the system. Now suppose that Alice has accidentally downloaded a malicious program. This program can access the system as Alice, bypassing the access control check on ''secret.txt''. The malicious program then copies the content of ''secret.txt'' and places it in ''public.txt'', allowing Bob and all other users to read it. This constitutes a violation of the intended confidentiality policy of the system.

==== Noninterference ====
[[Non-interference (security)|Noninterference]] is a property of programs that does not leak or reveal information of variables with a ''higher'' security classification, depending on the input of variables with a ''lower'' security classification. A program which satisfies noninterference should produce the same ''output'' whenever the corresponding same ''input'' on the ''lower'' variables are used. This must hold for every possible value on the input. This implies that even if ''higher'' variables in the program has different values from one execution to another, this should not be visible on the ''lower'' variables.

An attacker could try to execute a program which does not satisfy noninterference repeatedly and systematically to try to map its behavior. Several iterations could lead to the disclosure of ''higher'' variables, and let the attacker learn sensitive information about for example the systems state.

Whether a program satisfies noninterference or not can be evaluated during compilation assuming the presence of [[security type system]]s.

=== Security type system ===
{{Main|Security type system}}
A [[security type system]] is a kind of [[type system]] that can be used by software developers in order to check the security properties of their code. In a language with security types, the types of variables and expressions relate to the security policy of the application, and programmers may be able to specify the application security policy via type declarations. Types can be used to reason about various kinds of security policies, including authorization policies (as access control or capabilities) and information flow security. Security type systems can be formally related to the underlying security policy, and a security type system is sound if all programs that type-check satisfy the policy in a semantic sense. For example, a security type system for information flow might enforce noninterference, meaning that type checking reveals whether there is any violation of confidentiality or integrity in the program.

=== Securing low-level code ===
Vulnerabilities in low-level code are bugs or flaws that will lead the program into a state where further behavior of the program is undefined by the source programming language. The behavior of the low-level program will depend on compiler, runtime system or operating system details. This allows for an attacker to drive the program towards an undefined state, and exploit the behavior of the system.

Common exploits of insecure low-level code lets an attacker perform unauthorized reads or writes to memory addresses. The memory addresses can be either random  or chosen by the attacker.

==== Using safe languages ====
An approach to achieve secure low-level code is to use safe high-level languages. A safe language is considered to be completely defined by its programmers' manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=Benjamin C.|title=Types and Programming Languages|date=2002|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any bug that could lead to implementation-dependent behavior in a safe language will either be detected at compile time or lead to a well-defined error behavior at run-runtime. In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], if accessing an array out of bounds, an exception will be thrown. Examples of other safe languages are [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Scala programming language|Scala]].

==== Defensive execution of unsafe languages ====
During compilation of an unsafe language run-time checks is added to the low-level code to detect source-level undefined behavior. An example is the use of [[Buffer overflow protection#Canaries|canaries]], which can terminate a program when discovering bounds violations.
A downside of using run-time checks such as in bounds-checking is that they impose considerable performance overhead.

[[Memory protection]], such as using non-executable stack and/or heap, can also be seen as additional run-time checks. This is used by many modern operating systems.

==== Isolated execution of modules ====
The general idea is to identify sensitive code from application data by analyzing the source code. Once this is done the different data is separated and placed in different modules.  When assuming that each module has total control over the sensitive information it contains, it is possible to specify when and how should leave the module. 
An example is a cryptographic module that can prevent keys from ever leaving the module unencrypted.

=== Certifying compilation ===
Certifying compilation is the idea of producing a certificate during compilation of source code, using the information from the high-level programming language semantics. This certificate should be enclosed with the compiled code in order to provide a form of proof to the consumer that the source code was compiled according to a certain set of rules. The certificate can be produced in different ways, e.g. through [[Proof-carrying code]] (PCC) or [[Typed assembly language]] (TAL).

==== Proof-carrying code  ====
The main aspects of PCC can be summarized in the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozen|first1=Dexter|title=Language Based Security|date=1999|publisher=Cornell University|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/lbs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The supplier provides an executable program with various annotations produced by a [[certifying compiler]].
# The consumer provides a verification condition, based on a [[security policy]]. This is sent to the supplier.
# The supplier runs the verification condition in a [[Automated theorem proving|theorem prover]] to produce a proof to the consumer that the program in fact satisfies the security policy.
# The consumer then runs the proof in a [[Automated proof checking|proof checker]] to verify the proof validity.

An example of a certifying compiler is the [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/touchstone.html Touchstone compiler], that provides a PCC formal proof of type- and memory safety for programs implemented in Java.

==== Typed assembly language ====
TAL is applicable to programming languages that make use of a [[type system]]. After compilation, the [[object code]] will carry a type annotation that can be checked by an ordinary type checker. The annotation produced here is in many ways similar to the annotations provided by PCC, with some limitations. However, TAL can handle any security policy that may be expressed by the restrictions of the type system, which can include memory safety and control flow, among others.

'''Leo Morandi''' (14 September 1923 &amp;ndash; 2 May 2009) was a promoter of the new post-[[World War II]] commercial [[ceramic]]s industry of [[Sassuolo]], Italy. At first he collaborated with local ceramic producers ([[Marazzi Group]]) and with Industries D'Agostino in [[Salerno]], [[Italy]]. In 1954, after selling an innovative [[patent]] to Ceramiche Marazzi ([[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]] selection unit), he was able to initiate startup of his own equipment supply business. Leo Morandi's innovations, knowledge, and experience aided growth and advancement throughout the [[Sassuolo]] ceramic companies, which in the 1960s constituted the worldwide known ''Sassuolo tile district''.

==Impact on industry==
In particular, he used two [[electrodes]] to select the biscuit; the passage of electricity through the material showed that it was not suitable for the successive glazing.

The production chain for ceramic tiles was then mainly handcrafted and labour-intensive, but Leo Morandi's inventions started the successful automation of various units. After the initial years he was able to open a distinct efficient production unit. Morandi was a reserved man and did not like publicity. He involved his workers and customers in the improvement of his inventions and innovations.
[[File:Fiera di Modena 1959.jpg|200px|left]]
Ceramic industry equipment examples include: automated floor tile edge glaze remover, automated packaging (floor tiles where historically bound with thin iron wire, before shipment), specialized [[silk]] screen machines, the peristaltic [[pump]], the transport line, the [[hydraulic press]], [[tile]] overturning mechanism, press reception unit, and glazing applications done with disk booths. These basic tile processing elements are still in use.

Leo Morandi began exporting these proven automated Italian [[ceramic]] industry innovations to [[Spain]], allowing advancement of two primary ceramic industry clusters.

'''Mathematical sociology''' is the area of [[sociology]] that uses [[mathematics]] to construct social theories.  Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms.  The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively.  In mathematical sociology, the preferred style is encapsulated in the phrase "constructing a mathematical model."   This means making specified assumptions about some social phenomenon, expressing them in formal mathematics, and providing an empirical interpretation for the ideas.  It also means deducing properties of the model and comparing these with relevant empirical data.  [[Social network analysis]] is the best-known contribution of this subfield to sociology as a whole and to the scientific community at large. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are and they are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.cornell.edu/research/mathematical_sociology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Starting in the early 1940s, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]],&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky.: 1947/1949 (2nd ed.). ''Mathematical Theory of Human Relations: An Approach to Mathematical Biology of Social Phenomena''. Bloomington, ID: Principia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky. 1938/1948 (2nd ed.).'' Mathematical Biophysics:Physico-Mathematical Foundations of Biology''., University of Chicago Press : Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in the late 1940s, [[Anatol Rapoport]] and others, developed a [[relation algebra|relational]] and probabilistic approach to the characterization of large [[social network]]s in which the nodes are persons and the links are acquaintanceship. During the late 1940s, formulas were derived that connected local parameters such as closure of contacts – if A is linked to both B and C, then there is a greater than chance probability that B and C are linked to each other – to the global network property of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, Anatol. (1957).  "Contributions to the Theory of Random and Biased Nets." ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' 19: 257-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, acquaintanceship is a ''positive tie'', but what about ''negative ties'' such as animosity among persons?  To tackle this problem, [[graph theory]], which is the mathematical study of abstract representations of networks of points and lines, can be extended to include these two types of links and thereby to create models that represent both positive and negative sentiment relations, which are represented as [[signed graph]]s.  A signed graph is called ''balanced'' if the product of the signs of all relations in every cycle (links in every graph cycle) is positive.  Through formalization by mathematician [[Frank Harary]] this work produced the fundamental theorem of this theory.  It says that if a network of interrelated positive and negative ties is balanced, e.g. as illustrated by the psychological principle that "my friend's enemy is my enemy", then it consists of two subnetworks such that each has positive ties among its nodes and there are only negative ties between nodes in distinct subnetworks.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Dorwin &amp; Harary, Frank. (1956).  "[[Structural Balance]]: A Generalization of Heider's Theory."  ''Psychological Review'' 63:277-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  The imagery here is of a social system that splits into two cliques. There is, however, a special case where one of the two subnetworks is empty, which might occur in very small networks.
In another model, ties have relative strengths. 'Acquaintanceship' can be viewed as a 'weak' tie and 'friendship' is represented as a strong tie.  Like its uniform cousin discussed above, there is a concept of closure, called strong triadic closure.  A graph satisfies strong triadic closure If A is strongly connected to B, and B is strongly connected to C, then A and C must have a tie (either weak or strong).

n these two developments we have mathematical models bearing upon the analysis of structure.  Other early influential developments in mathematical sociology pertained to process.  For instance, in 1952 [[Herbert A. Simon]] produced a mathematical formalization of a published theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homans |first1=George C |title=The Human Group |date=1950 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and World |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social groups]] by constructing a model consisting of a deterministic system of differential equations.  A formal study of the system led to theorems about the dynamics and the implied [[equilibrium state]]s of any group.

The emergence of mathematical models in the social sciences was part of the zeitgeist in the 1940s and 1950s in which a variety of new interdisciplinary scientific innovations occurred, such as [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[cybernetics]] and mathematical model building in the social and behavioral sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lazarsfeld |first1=Paul F |last2=Henry |first2=Neil W |title=Editors. Readings in Mathematical Social Science |date=1966 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==

In 1954, a critical expository analysis of Rashevsky's social behavior models was written by sociologist James S. Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |title=An expository analysis of some of Rashevsky's social behavior models |journal=Mathematical Thinking in the Social Sciences edited by Paul F. Lazarsfeld |date=1954 |issue=New York: The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashevsky's models and as well as the model constructed by Simon raise a question: how can one connect such theoretical models to the data of sociology, which often take the form of surveys in which the results are expressed in the form of proportions of people believing or doing something.  This suggests deriving the equations from assumptions about the chances of an individual changing state in a small interval of time, a procedure well known in the mathematics of [[stochastic processes]].

Coleman embodied this idea in his 1964 book ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', which showed how stochastic processes in social networks could be analyzed in such a way as to enable testing of the constructed model by comparison with the relevant data. The same idea can and has been applied to processes of change in social relations, an active research theme in the study of social networks, illustrated by an empirical study appearing in the journal Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kossinets |first1=Gueorgi |last2=Watts |first2=Duncan J |title=An empirical analysis of an evolving social network |journal=Science |date=2006 |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=88-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work, Coleman employed mathematical ideas drawn from economics, such as [[general equilibrium theory]], to argue that general social theory should begin with a concept of [[purposive action]] and, for analytical reasons, approximate such action by the use of [[rational choice]] models (Coleman, 1990).  This argument is similar to viewpoints expressed by other sociologists in their efforts to use rational choice theory in sociological analysis although such efforts have met with substantive and philosophical criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique. Editors. |date=1992 |publisher=Sage |location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, structural analysis of the type indicated earlier received a further extension to social networks based on institutionalized social relations, notably those of kinship.  The linkage of mathematics and sociology here involved abstract algebra, in particular, [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C. 1963. An Anatomy of Kinship. Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in turn, led to a focus on a data-analytical version of homomorphic reduction of a complex social network (which along with many other techniques is presented in [[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman]] and Faust 1994&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman, S.]], &amp; Faust, K.. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. New York and Cambridge, ENG: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In regard to Rapoport's random and biased net theory, his 1961 study of a large sociogram, co-authored with Horvath turned out to become a very influential paper. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rapoport |first1=Anatol |last2=Horvath |first2=N J |title=A study of a large sociogram |journal=Behavioral Science |date=1961 |volume=6 |pages=279-291}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was early evidence of this influence. In 1964, Thomas Fararo and a co-author analyzed another large friendship sociogram using a biased net model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Sunshine |first2=Morris |title=A Study of Biased Friendship Net |date=1964 |publisher=Youth Development Center and Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1960s, Stanley Milgram described the small world problem and undertook a field experiment dealing with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milgram |first1=Stanley |title=The small world problem |journal=Psychology Today |date=May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Milgram |first2=Stanley |title=An experimental study of the small world problem |journal=Sociometry |date=1969 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=425-443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly fertile idea was suggested and applied by Mark Granovetter in which he drew upon Rapoport's 1961 paper to suggest and apply a distinction between weak and strong ties. The key idea was that there was "strength" in weak ties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Granovetter |first1=Mark |title=The Strength of Weak Ties |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1973 |volume=78 |pages=1360-1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some programs of research in sociology employ experimental methods to study social interaction processes.  [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]] and his colleagues initiated such a program in which the central idea is the use of the theoretical concept "expectation state" to construct theoretical models to explain interpersonal processes, e.g., those linking external status in society to differential influence in local group decision-making. Much of this theoretical work is linked to mathematical model building, especially after the late 1970s adoption of a graph theoretic representation of social information processing, as Berger (2000) describes in looking back upon the development of his program of research. In 1962 he and his collaborators explained model building by reference to the goal of the model builder, which could be explication of a concept in a theory, representation of a single recurrent social process, or a broad theory based on a theoretical construct, such as, respectively, the concept of balance in psychological and social structures, the process of conformity in an experimental situation, and stimulus sampling theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P |last3=Snell |first3=J Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The generations of mathematical sociologists that followed Rapoport, Simon, Harary, Coleman, White and Berger, including those entering the field in the 1960s such as Thomas Fararo, Philip Bonacich, and Tom Mayer, among others, drew upon their work in a variety of ways.

==Present research==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Mathematical sociology remains a small subfield within the discipline, but it has succeeded in spawning a number of other subfields which share its goals of formally modeling social life.  The foremost of these fields is [[social network analysis]], which has become among the fastest growing areas of sociology in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=John |title=Social Network Analysis. 4th Edition. |date=2017 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major development in the field is the rise of [[computational sociology]], which expands the mathematical toolkit with the use of [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]] and advanced statistical methods.  The latter subfield also makes use of the vast new data sets on social activity generated by social interaction on the internet.

One important indicator of the significance of mathematical sociology is that the general interest journals in the field, including such central journals as ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review'', have published mathematical models that became influential in the field at large.  

More recent trends in mathematical sociology are evident in contributions to ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (JMS).  Several trends stand out: the further development of formal theories that explain experimental data dealing with small group processes, the continuing interest in structural balance as a major mathematical and theoretical idea, the interpenetration of mathematical models oriented to theory and innovative quantitative techniques relating to methodology, the use of computer simulations to study problems in social complexity, interest in [[micro–macro linkage]] and the problem of emergence, and ever-increasing research on networks of social relations.  
 
Thus, topics from the earliest days, like balance and network models, continue to be of contemporary interest. The formal techniques employed remain many of the standard and well-known methods of mathematics: differential equations, stochastic processes and game theory. Newer tools like agent-based models used in computer simulation studies are prominently represented. Perennial substantive problems still drive research: [[social diffusion]], [[social influence]], [[social status]] origins and consequences, segregation, cooperation, [[collective action]], power, and much more.
 
== Research programs== 
Many of the developments in mathematical sociology, including [[Formal theory (political science)|formal theory]], have exhibited notable decades-long advances that began with path-setting contributions by leading mathematical sociologists and formal theorists.  This provides another way of taking note of recent contributions but with an emphasis on continuity with early work through the use of the idea of “[[research program]],” which is a coherent series of theoretical and empirical studies based on some fundamental principle or approach.  There are more than a few of these programs and what follows is no more than a brief capsule description of leading exemplars of this idea in which there is an emphasis on the originating leadership in each program and its further development over decades.

(1) [[Rational Choice Theory]] and James S. Coleman: After his 1964 pioneering ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', Coleman continued to make contributions to social theory and mathematical model building and his 1990 volume, ''Foundations of Social Theory'' was the major theoretical work of a career that spanned the period from 1950s to 1990s and included many other research-based contributions..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Jon  Editor |title=James S Coleman |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge. Taylor and Francis Group |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation book combined accessible examples of how rational choice theory could function in the analysis of such sociological topics as authority, [[trust (emotion)|trust]], [[social capital]] and the [[Social norm|norm]]s (in particular, their emergence).  In this way, the book showed how rational choice theory could provide an effective basis for making the transition from micro to macro levels of sociological explanation.  An important feature of the book is its use of mathematical ideas in generalizing the rational choice model to include [[interpersonal sentiment relations]] as modifiers of outcomes and doing so such that the generalized theory captures the original more self-oriented theory as a special case, as point emphasized in a later analysis of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |pages=255-278 (Ch. 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality presupposition of the theory led to debates among sociological theorists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S. |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J. |title=Editors.  Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique |date=1992 |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, many sociologists drew upon Coleman’s formulation of a general template for micro-macro transition to gain leverage on the continuation of topics central to his and the discipline's explanatory focus on a variety of macrosocial phenomena in which rational choice simplified the micro level in the interest of combining individual actions to account for macro outcomes of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raub |first1=Werner |last2=Buskens |first2=Vincent |last3=Van Assen |first3=Marcel |title=Micro-macro links and microfoundations in sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=2011 |volume=35 |pages=1-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(2) [[Structuralism (Formal)]] and Harrison C. White: In the decades since his earliest contributions, Harrison White has led the field in putting social structural analysis on a mathematical and empirical basis, including the 1970 publication of ''Chains of Opportunity: System Models of Mobility in Organization''s which set out and applied to data a [[vacancy chain]] model for mobility in and across organizations.   His very influential other work includes the operational concepts of [[blockmodel]] and [[structural equivalence]] which start from a body of social relational data to produce analytical results using these procedures and concepts.   These ideas and methods were developed in collaboration with his former students [[François Lorraine]], [[Ronald Breiger]], and [[Scott Boorman]]. These three are among the more than 30 students who earned their doctorates under White in the period 1963-1986. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Azarian |first1=Reza |title=The General Sociology of Harrison White |date=2003 |publisher=Department of Sociology, Stockholm University |location=Stockholm, Sweden |isbn=91-7265-603-4 |pages=213-216 |ref=Azarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory and application of blockmodels has been set out in detail in a recent monograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doreian |first1=Patrick |last2=Batagelj |first2=Vladimir |last3=Ferligoj |first3=Anuska |title=Generalized Blockmodeling |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=0-521-84085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. White's later contributions include a structuralist approach to markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Markets from Networks: Socioeconomic Models of Production |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1992, a general theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control: A Structural Theory of Social Action |date=1992 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, later appearing in a revised edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control |date=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
(3) [[Expectation states theory]] and Joseph Berger: Under Berger’s intellectual and organizational leadership, Expectation States Theory branched out into a large number of specific programs of research on specific problems, each treated in terms of the master concept of expectation states.  He and his colleague and frequent collaborator [[Morris Zelditch Jr]] not only produced work of their own but created a doctoral program at Stanford University that led to an enormous outpouring of research by notable former students, including [[Murray Webster]], [[David Wagner (sociologist)|David Wagner]], and [[Hamit Fisek]].  Collaboration with mathematician [[Robert Z. Norman]] led to the use of mathematical graph theory as a way of representing and analyzing social information processing in self-other(s) interactions.  Berger and Zelditch also advanced work in formal theorizing and mathematical model building as early as 1962 with a collaborative expository analysis of types of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P. |last3=Snell |first3=J. Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berger and Zelditch stimulated advances in other theoretical research programs by providing outlets for the publication of new work, culminating in a 2002 edited volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Zelditch Jr |first2=Morris |title=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory |date=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; that  includes a chapter that presents an authoritative overview of [[Expectation states theory]] as a program of cumulative research dealing with [[group processes]].
 
(4) Formalization in [[Theoretical Sociology]] and Thomas J. Fararo: Many of this sociologist’s contributions have been devoted to bringing mathematical thinking into greater contact with sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Editor. Mathematical Ideas and Sociological Theory: Current State and Prospects |date=1984 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He organized a symposium attended by sociological theorists in which formal theorists delivered papers that were subsequently published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Symposium on Formal Theory |journal=Sociological Theory |date=November 2000 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=475-523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through collaborations with students and colleagues his own theoretical research program dealt with such topics as [[macrostructural theory]] and [[E-state structuralism]] (both with former student [[John Skvoretz]]), [[subjective images of stratification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Kosaka |first2=Kenji |title=Generating Images of Stratification: A Formal Theory |date=2003 |publisher=Springer |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with former student [[Kenji Kosaka]]), [[tripartite structural analysis]] (with colleague [[Patrick Doreian]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Doreian |first2=Patrick |title=Tripartite structural analysis |journal=Social Networks |date=1984 |volume=6 |pages=141-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational sociology]] (with colleague [[Norman P. Hummon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=The emergence of computational sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=2-3 |pages=79-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Actors and networks as objects |journal=Social Networks |date=1995 |volume=17 |pages=1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his books are extended treatments of his approach to theoretical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=The Meaning of General Theoretical Sociology: Tradition and Formalization |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(5) Social Network Analysis and [[Linton C. Freeman]]:  In the early 1960s Freeman directed a sophisticated empirical study of [[community power structure]].  In 1978 he established the journal ''Social Networks.''  It rapidly became a major outlet for original research papers that used mathematical techniques to analyze network data.  The journal also publishes conceptual and theoretical contributions, including his paper “[[Centrality]] in Social Networks: Conceptual Clarification.” The paper has been cited more than 13,000 times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linton C Freeman |website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In turn, the mathematical concept defined in that paper led to further elaborations of the ideas, to experimental tests, and to numerous applications in empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |last2=Roeder |first2=Douglas |last3=Mulholland |first3=Robert |title=Centrality in social networks II. Experimental results |journal=Social Networks |date=1979-1980 |volume=2 |pages=119-141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of a study of the history and sociology of the field of social network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |title=The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |date=2004 |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston, SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(6) [[Quantitative Methodology]] and [[Kenneth C. Land]]: Kenneth Land has been on the frontier of quantitative methodology in sociology as well as formal theoretical model building.  The influential yearly volume ''Sociological Methodology'' has been one of Land’s favorite outlets for the publication of papers that often lie in the intersection of quantitative methodology and mathematical sociology.  Two of his theoretical papers appeared early in this journal: “Mathematical Formalization of Durkheim's Theory of Division of Labor” (1970) and “Formal Theory” (1971).  His decades-long research program includes contributions relating to numerous special topics and methods, including [[social statistics]], [[social indicators]], stochastic processes, [[mathematical criminology]], [[demography]] and [[social forecasting]].  Thus Land brings to these fields the skills of a statistician, a mathematician and a sociologist, combined. 
 
(7) [[Affect Control Theory]] and [[David R. Heise]]:  In 1979, Heise published a groundbreaking formal and empirical study in the tradition of interpretive sociology, especially symbolic interactionism,''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action.'' It was the origination of a research program that has included his further theoretical and empirical studies and those of other sociologists, such as  [[Lynn Smith-Lovin]], [[Dawn Robinson]] and [[Neil MacKinnon]]. Definition of the situation and self-other definitions are two of the leading concepts in affect control theory. The formalism used by Heise and other contributors uses a validated form of measurement and a [[cybernetic]] control mechanism in which immediate feelings and compared with fundamental sentiments in such a way as to generate an effort to bring immediate feelings in a situation into correspondence with sentiments. In the simplest models, each person in an interactive pair, is represented in terms of one side of a role relationship in which fundamental sentiments associated with each role guide the process of immediate interaction.  A higher level of the control process can be activated in which the definition of the situation is transformed. This research program comprises several of the key chapters in a  2006 volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClelland |first1=Kent |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas |title=Purpose, Meaning and Action: Control Systems Theories in Sociology |date=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of contributions to control systems theory (in the sense of Powers 1975 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powers |first1=William |title=Behavior: The Control of Perception |date=1975 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago, IL.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in sociology.
 
(8) "Distributive Justice Theory" and [[Guillermina Jasso]]: Since 1980, Jasso has treated problems of distributive justice with an original theory that uses mathematical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=A new theory of distributive justice |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1980 |volume=45 |pages=3-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has elaborated upon and applied this theory to a wide range of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=Curriculum Vitae 2018 |url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/jasso_cv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her most general mathematical apparatus – with the theory of distributive justice as a special case -- deals with any subjective comparison between some actual state and some reference level for it, e.g., a comparison of an actual reward with an expected reward.  In her justice theory, she starts with a very simple premise, the justice evaluation function (the natural logarithm of the ratio of actual to just reward) and then derives numerous empirically testable implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Gullermina |title=Seven secrets of doing theory |journal=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory edited by J Berger and M Zelditch Jr |date=2002 |pages=317-342}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(9) Collaborative research and John Skvoretz. A major feature of modern science is collaborative research in which the distinctive skills of the participants combine to produce original research.  Skvoretz, in addition to this other contributions, has been a frequent collaborator in a variety of theoretical research programs, often using mathematical expertise as well as skills in experimental design, statistical data analysis and simulation methods.  Some examples are: (1) Collaborative work on theoretical, statistical and mathematical problems in biased net theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |last3=Agneessens |first3=F |title=Advances in biased net theory:Definitions, derivations, and estimations |journal=Social Networks |date=2004 |volume=26 |pages=113-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (2) Collaborative contributions to Expectation States Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Status and participation in task groups: A dynamic network model |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1996 |volume=101 |pages=1366-1414}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) Collaborative contributions to [[Elementary Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Willer |first2=Dave |title=Exclusion and power: a test of four theories of power in exchange networks |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1993 |volume=58 |pages=801-818}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) Collaboration with [[Bruce Mayhew]] in a structuralist research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Mayhew |first2=Bruce |title=The structure of stratified systems and the structure of mobility: a first approximation to a structural theory of vertical mobility |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1988 |volume=13 |pages=193-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1970s, Skvoretz has been one of the most prolific of contributors to the advance of mathematical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |title=Looking backwards into the future: Mathematical sociology then and now |journal=Sociological Theory |date=2000 |volume=18 |pages=510-517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The above discussion could be expanded to include many other programs and individuals including European sociologists such as [[Peter Abell]] and the late [[Raymond Boudon]].

==Texts and journals==
Mathematical sociology textbooks cover a variety of models, usually explaining the required mathematical background before discussing important work in the literature (Fararo 1973, Leik and Meeker 1975, Bonacich and Lu 2012). An earlier text by [[Otomar Bartos]] (1967) is still of relevance. Of wider scope and mathematical sophistication is the text by Rapoport (1983).  A very reader-friendly and imaginative introduction to explanatory thinking leading to models is Lave and March (1975, reprinted 1993). The ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (started in 1971) has been open to papers covering a broad spectrum of topics employing a variety of types of mathematics, especially through frequent special issues. Other journals in sociology who publish papers with substantial use of mathematics are [https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10588 Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory], [https://www.cmu.edu/joss/index.html Journal of social structure], [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation] 

Articles in ''Social Networks,'' a journal devoted to social structural analysis, very often employ mathematical models and related structural data analyses.  In addition – importantly indicating the penetration of mathematical model building into sociological research – the major comprehensive journals in sociology, especially ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review,'' regularly publish articles featuring mathematical formulations.

A '''mating system''' is a way in which a group is structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The precise meaning depends upon the context. With respect to [[animals]], the term describes which males and females [[mating|mate]], under which circumstances; recognised systems include [[monogamy]], [[polygamy]] (which includes [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], and [[polygynandry]]), and [[promiscuity]], all of which lead to different [[mate choice]] outcomes and thus these systems affect how [[sexual selection]] works in the species which practice them. In plants, the term refers to the degree and circumstances of [[outcrossing]]. In human [[sociobiology]], the terms have been extended to encompass the formation of relationships such as [[marriage]].

==In plants==
{{See also|Plant reproduction}}
The primary mating systems in plants are [[outcrossing]] (cross-fertilisation), [[autogamy]] (self-fertilisation) and [[apomixis]] (asexual reproduction without fertilization, but only when arising by modification of sexual function). Mixed mating systems, in which plants use two or even all three mating systems, are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A. H. D.| year = 1989 | chapter = Isozyme analysis of plant mating systems |editor1=Soltis, D. E. |editor2=[[Soltis, P. S.]] | title = Isozymes in Plant Biology | pages = 73–86 | publisher = Dioscorides Press | location = Portland|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of models have been used to describe the parameters of plant mating systems. The basic model is the [[mixed mating model]], which is based on the assumption that every fertilisation is either self-fertilisation or completely random cross-fertilisation. More complex models relax this assumption; for example, the [[effective selfing model]] recognises that mating may be more common between pairs of closely related plants than between pairs of distantly related plants.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

{{See also|Animal sexual behaviour#Mating systems|Polygyny threshold model|Monogamous pairing in animals}}
The following are some of the mating systems generally recognized in animals:
*[[Monogamy]]: One male and one female have an exclusive mating relationship. The term "[[pair bond]]ing" often implies this. This is associated with one-male, one-female group compositions. There are two types of monogamy: type 1, which is facultative, and type 2, which is obligate. Facultative monogamy occurs when there are very low densities in a species. This means that mating occurs with only a single member of the opposite sex because males and females are very far apart. When a female needs aid from conspecifics in order to have a litter this is obligate monogamy. However, with this, the habitat carrying capacity is small so it means only one female can breed within the habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleiman | first1 = Devra G | year = 1977 | title = Monogamy in Mammals | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 39–69 | doi = 10.1086/409721 | pmid = 857268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polygamy]]: Three types are recognized:
**[[Polygyny in nature|Polygyny]] (the most common polygamous mating system in [[vertebrates]] so far studied): One male has an exclusive relationship with two or more females. This is associated with one-male, multi-female group compositions. Many perennial ''[[Vespula squamosa ]]'' (southern yellowjacket) colonies are polygynous.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, K. M., Osborne, D. M., Wahl, D., and Wenzel, J. W. (2001). "An Enormous Nest of Vespula squamosa from Florida, the Largest Social Was Nest Reported from North America, with Notes on Colony Cycle and Reproduction", "Journal of the New York Entomological Society", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of polygyny exist, such as lek polygyny and resource defense polygyny. Grayling butterflies (''[[Grayling (butterfly)|Hipparchia semele]]'') engage in resource defense polygyny, where females choose a territorial male based on the best oviposition site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreisig|first=H.|date=1995-02-01|title=Thermoregulation and flight activity in territorial male graylings, Hipparchia semele (Satyridae), and large skippers, Ochlodes venata (Hesperiidae)|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=101|issue=2|pages=169–176|doi=10.1007/BF00317280|pmid=28306787|issn=0029-8549|bibcode=1995Oecol.101..169D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animals opt for only one of these strategies, some exhibit hybrid strategies, such as the bee species, ''[[Xylocopa micans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Change in mandibular and mesosomal gland contents of maleXylocopa micans (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae) associated with mating system|journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology|date = 1990-06-01|issn = 0098-0331|pages = 1877–1885|volume = 16|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/BF01020501|pmid = 24263991|first = H. J.|last = McAuslane|first2 = S. B.|last2 = Vinson|first3 = H. J.|last3 = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**[[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]]: One female has an exclusive relationship with two or more males. This is very rare and is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions. Genetic polyandry is found some insect species such as [[Western Honey Bee|''Apis mellifera'']] (the Western Honey Bee), in which a virgin queen will mate with multiple drones during her nuptial flight whereas each drone will die immediately upon mating once. The queen will then store the sperm collected from these multiple matings in her spermatheca to use to fertilize eggs throughout the course of her entire reproductive life.
**[[Polygynandry]]: Polygynandry is a slight variation of this, where two or more males have an exclusive relationship with two or more females; the numbers of males and females don't have to be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, the number of males is usually less. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.
*[[Promiscuity]]: A member of one sex within the social group mates with any member of the opposite sex. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.

These mating relationships may or may not be associated with social relationships, in which the sexual partners stay together to become parenting partners. As the alternative term "pair bonding" implies, this is usual in monogamy. In many polyandrous systems, the males and the female stay together to rear the young. In polygynous systems where the number of females paired with each male is low and the male will often stay with one female to help rear the young, while the other females rear their young on their own. In polygynandry, each of the males may assist one female; if all adults help rear all the young, the system is more usually called "[[communal breeding]]". In highly polygynous systems, and in promiscuous systems, paternal care of young is rare, or there may be no parental care at all.

These descriptions are idealized, and the social partnerships are often easier to observe than the mating relationships. In particular:
*the relationships are rarely exclusive for all individuals in a species. [[DNA fingerprinting]] studies have shown that even in pair-bonding, matings outside the pair (extra-pair copulations) occur with fair frequency, and a significant minority of offspring result from them. However, the offspring that are a result of extra-pair copulations usually exhibit more advantageous genes. These genes can be associated with improvements in appearance, mating, and the functioning of internal body systems.&lt;ref name="Bekoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|last1=Bekoff|first1=Marc|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-32747-6|location=Westport|pages=889–891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310505282|title=Female Sneak Copulation: In: Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science|last=Howie|first=James|date=January 2017|website=Researchgate|access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*some species show different mating systems in different circumstances, for example in different parts of their geographical range, or under different conditions of food availability
*mixtures of the simple systems described above may occur.

[[Sexual conflict|Sexual Conflict]] occurs between individuals of different sexes that have separate or conflicting requirements for optimal mating success. This conflict may lead to competitive adaptations and co-adaptations of one or both of the sexes to maintain mating processes that are beneficial to that sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=G. A.|title=Sexual conflict over mating and fertilization: an overview|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=28 February 2006|volume=361|issue=1466|pages=235–259|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1785|pmid=16612884|pmc=1569603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yasukawa|first1=Ken|last2=Tang-Martínez|first2=Zuleyma|title=Animal behavior : how and why animals do the things they do|date=2014|publisher=Praeger|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-313-39870-4|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intralocus sexual conflict]] and [[interlocus sexual conflict]] describe the genetic influence behind sexual conflict, and are presently recognized as the most basic forms of sexual conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===In humans===
{{See also|Monogamy|Polygyny|Polyandry|Polyamory}}
Compared to other [[vertebrate]]s, where a species usually has a single mating system, human display great variety. Humans also differ by having formal [[marriage]]s which in some cultures involve negotiation and arrangement between elder relatives. Regarding sexual dimorphism (see the section about animals above), humans are in the intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but with relatively large testes. This indicates relatively frequent sperm competition which is supported by reports of extrapair paternity of 2–22% in socially monogamous and polygynous human societies. One estimate is that 83% of human societies are polygynous, 0.05% are polyandrous, and the rest are monogamous. Even the last group may at least in part be genetically polygynous.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 30 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage systems by Bobbi S. Low&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint,  females are more prone to practice [[monogamy]] because their reproductive success is based on the resources she is able to acquire through reproduction rather than the quantity of offspring she produces. However, men are more likely to practice [[polygamy]] because his reproductive success is based on the amount of offsprings he produces, rather than any kind of benefit from parental investment.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2002 19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary Explanations of Human Behaviour|last=Cartwright|first=John. H|publisher=Taylor and Franis e-Library|year=2002|isbn=978-0-203-47064-0|location=New York, NY|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polygyny is associated with an increased sharing of subsistence provided by women. This is consistent with the theory that if women raise the children alone, men can concentrate on the mating effort. Polygyny is also associated with greater environmental variability in the form of variability of [[rainfall]]. This may increase the differences in the resources available to men. An important association is that polygyny is associated with a higher [[pathogen]] load in an area which may make having good genes in a male increasingly important. A high pathogen load also decreases the relative importance of [[sororal polygyny]] which may be because it becomes increasingly important to have genetic variability in the offspring (See [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]).&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Virtually all the terms used to describe animal mating systems were adopted from [[social anthropology]], where they had been devised to describe systems of [[marriage]]. This shows that human sexual behavior is unusually flexible since, in most animal species, one mating system dominates. While there are close analogies between animal mating systems and human marriage institutions, these analogies should not be pressed too far, because in human societies, marriages typically have to be recognized by the entire social group in some way, and there is no equivalent process in animal societies. The temptation to draw conclusions about what is "natural" for human sexual behavior from observations of animal mating systems should be resisted: a socio-biologist observing the kinds of behavior shown by humans in any other species would conclude that all known mating systems were natural for that species, depending on the circumstances or on individual differences.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2002 19"/&gt;

As culture increasingly affects human mating choices, ascertaining what is the 'natural' mating system of the human animal from a zoological perspective becomes increasingly difficult. Some clues can be taken from human anatomy, which is essentially unchanged from the prehistoric past:

*humans have a large relative size of testes to body mass in comparison to most primates;
*humans have a large ejaculate volume and sperm count in comparison to other primates;
*as compared to most primates, humans spend more time in copulation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bonobo-sex-and-society-2006-06/|title=Bonobo Sex and Society: The behavior of a close relative challenges assumptions about male supremacy in human evolution|last=De Waal|first=Frans|date=March 1996|website=Scientific American|access-date=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*as compared to most primates, humans [[copulate]] with greater frequency;
*the outward signs of [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] in women (i.e. higher body temperature, breast swelling, sugar cravings, etc.), are often perceived to be less obvious in comparison to the outward signs of ovulation in most other mammals;
*for most mammals, the estrous cycle and its outward signs bring on mating activity; the majority of female-initiated matings in humans coincides with estrous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beach|first1=Frank|title=Sexual attractivity, proceptivity, and receptivity in female mammals|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=1976|volume=7|issue=1|pages=105–138|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X76900088|accessdate=20 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0018-506x(76)90008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but humans copulate throughout the reproductive cycle;
*after ejaculation/orgasm in males and females, humans release a hormone that has a sedative effect;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esch|first1=Tobias|last2=Stefano|first2=George|title=The Neurobiology of Love|journal=Neuro Endocrinology Letters|date=June 2005|volume=26|issue=3|pages=175–92|pmid=15990719}}&lt;/ref&gt; however human females may remain sexually receptive and may remain in the plateau stage of orgasm if their orgasm has not been completed.

Some have suggested that these anatomical factors signify some degree of [[sperm competition]], though as levels of genetic and societal promiscuity are highly varied across cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raptor1.bizlab.mtsu.edu/s-drive/TEFF/662/papers2010/men_dominance/The%20Mating%20System%20of%20Foragers%20in%20the%20Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302125838/http://raptor1.bizlab.mtsu.edu/s-drive/TEFF/662/papers2010/men_dominance/The%20Mating%20System%20of%20Foragers%20in%20the%20Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this evidence is far from conclusive.

==In microorganisms==

===Bacteria===

Mating in [[bacteria]] involves transfer of DNA from one cell to another and incorporation of the transferred DNA into the recipient bacteria’s [[genome]] by [[homologous recombination]].  Transfer of DNA between bacterial cells can occur in three main ways.  First, a bacterium can take up [[exogenous DNA]] released into the intervening medium from another bacterium by a process called [[Transformation (genetics)|'''transformation''']].  DNA can also be transferred from one bacterium to another by the process of [[Transduction (genetics)|'''transduction''']], which is mediated by an infecting virus (bacteriophage).  The third method of DNA transfer is [[Bacterial conjugation|''conjugation'']], in which a [[plasmid]] mediates transfer through direct cell contact between cells.

Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process,&lt;ref name="pmid15083159"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial [[adaptation]] for DNA transfer.  In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed [[natural competence]].  In ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' about 40 genes are required for the development of competence and DNA uptake.&lt;ref name="pmid8901420"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solomon JM, Grossman AD |title=Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in bacteria |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=150–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8901420 |doi= 10.1016/0168-9525(96)10014-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of DNA transferred during ''B. subtilis'' transformation can be as much as a third and up to the whole chromosome.&lt;ref name="pmid11388459"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akamatsu T, Taguchi H |title=Incorporation of the whole chromosomal DNA in protoplast lysates into competent cells of Bacillus subtilis |journal=Biosci.

===Archaea===

In several species of [[archaea]], mating is mediated by formation of cellular aggregates.

===Protists===

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists.  Mating and [[sexual reproduction]] are widespread among extant eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=|bibcode=1999JMolE..48..779D }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating. To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.&lt;ref name=Bernstein13 /&gt;

===Viruses===

Both animal viruses and bacterial viruses ([[bacteriophage]]) are able to undergo mating.  When a cell is mixedly infected by two genetically marked viruses, recombinant virus progeny are often observed indicating that mating interaction had occurred at the DNA level.  Another manifestation of mating between viral genomes is multiplicity reactivation (MR).  MR is the process by which at least two virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact with each other in an infected cell to form viable progeny viruses.  The genes required for MR in bacteriophage T4 are largely the same as the genes required for allelic recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid6261109"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein C |title=Deoxyribonucleic acid repair in bacteriophage |journal=Microbiol.

{{distinguish|Mensuration (disambiguation)}}
'''Menstruation in mammals''' is the shedding of the uterine lining ([[endometrium]]).  It occurs on a regular basis in sexually reproductive-age [[Female mammals|females of certain mammal species]].

Although there is some disagreement in definitions between sources, menstruation is generally considered to be limited to [[primate]]s. Overt menstruation (where there is bleeding from the [[uterus]] through the [[vagina]]) is found primarily in humans and close relatives such as [[chimpanzees]].&lt;ref name="strassmann"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strassmann BI | title = The evolution of endometrial cycles and menstruation | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–220 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8693059 | doi = 10.1086/419369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is common in [[simian]]s ([[Old World monkey]]s,  and [[ape]]s), but completely lacking in [[strepsirrhine]] primates and possibly weakly present in [[tarsier]]s.

Females of other species of [[Eutheria|placental mammal]] undergo [[estrous cycle]]s, in which the [[endometrium]] is completely reabsorbed by the animal (covert menstruation) at the end of its [[Biological life cycle|reproductive cycle]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2017}} Many zoologists regard this as different from a "true" menstrual cycle. Female domestic animals used for breeding —for example dogs, pigs, cattle, or horses— are monitored for physical signs of an [[estrous cycle]] period, which indicates that the animal is ready for [[insemination]].

===Concealed ovulation===
{{see also|concealed ovulation}}
A few mammals do not experience obvious, visible signs of fertility ([[concealed ovulation]]). In humans, while women can learn to recognize their own level of fertility ([[fertility awareness]]), whether men can detect fertility in women is debated; recent studies have given conflicting results.&lt;ref&gt;Studies that found women are more attractive to men when fertile:

Recent reviews suggest that menstruation itself is not an evolved, adaptive trait. Rather, it is an inherent consequence of spontaneous [[decidualization]] evolving as a derived trait from non-spontaneous decidualization. Spontaneous decidualization allows for more maternal control in the maternal-fetal conflict by increasing selectivity over the implanted embryo.&lt;ref name="Emera_2012" /&gt;

All female [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] have a uterine lining that builds up when the animal is fertile, but is dismantled (menstruated) when the animal is infertile.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2017}} Some anthropologists have questioned the energy cost of rebuilding the [[endometrium]] every fertility cycle. However, anthropologist Beverly Strassmann has proposed that the energy savings of not having to ''continuously'' maintain the uterine lining more than offsets energy cost of having to rebuild the lining in the next fertility cycle, even in species such as humans where much of the lining is lost through bleeding (overt menstruation) rather than reabsorbed (covert menstruation).&lt;ref name="strassmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obsolete"&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Kathleen | last = O'Grady | name-list-format = vanc | title =  Is Menstruation Obsolete? | publisher = The Canadian Women's Health Network | year = 2000 | url = http://www.cwhn.ca/resources/menstruation/obsolete.html | access-date = 2007-01-21 | authorlink = Kathleen O'Grady }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in humans, much of it is re-absorbed.

Many have questioned the evolution of overt menstruation in humans and related species, speculating on what advantage there could be to losing blood associated with dismantling the endometrium rather than absorbing it, as most mammals do.

==Animal estrous cycles==
The female will ovulate spontaneously and be receptive to the male to be bred (express estrus) at regular biologically defined intervals. The female is receptive to males only while experiencing estrus.

For breeding livestock, there are a number of advantages to be gained by finding methods to induce ovulation on a planned schedule, and thus synchronize the estrus cycle between many female animals. If animals can be bred on the same schedule, it increases convenience for the livestock owner, since the young animals will be at the same stage of development. Also, if [[artificial insemination]] (AI) is used for breeding, the AI technician's time can be used more efficiently, by breeding several females at the same time.  In order to induce estrus, a variety of techniques have been tried in recent years, involving different ways of injecting or feeding hormones to livestock. They are costly, and have variable success rates.&lt;ref name="Estrous"&gt;{{cite web|title=Estrous|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/wjm/repro/estrous.htm|publisher=University of Wyoming|access-date=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="899">A '''mycotroph''' is a [[plant]] that gets all or part of its carbon, water, or nutrient supply through [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association with [[fungus|fungi]]. The term can refer to plants that engage in either of two distinct symbioses with fungi:

*Many mycotrophs have a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with fungi in any of several forms of '''[[mycorrhiza]]'''. The majority of plant species are mycotrophic in this sense. Examples include [[Burmanniaceae]].
*Some mycotrophs are [[parasitism|parasitic]] upon fungi in an association known as '''[[myco-heterotrophy]]'''.

The '''National Institute of Economic and Social Research''' ('''NIESR'''), established in 1938,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is Britain's oldest independent economic research institute. The institute is a [[London]]-based&lt;ref name=niesr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niesr.ac.uk/about-us|title=About us|publisher=National Institute of Economic and Social Research|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+National+Institute+Of+Economic+and+Social+Research/@51.4958111,-0.1302628,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487604c2c52f65bf:0xddad8b71da529e83!8m2!3d51.4958078!4d-0.1280741?hl=en|title=Google Maps|last=|first=|work=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; independent UK registered charity that carries out academic research of relevance to business and policy makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered charities in England and Wales|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details?regid=306083&amp;subid=0|website=Charity Commission|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, both nationally and internationally.

==History==
The NIESR was established in 1938 with funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[Pilgrim Trust]], the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and the [[Halley Stewart Trust]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The vision of its founders was to carry out research to improve understanding of the economic and social forces that affect people’s lives, and the ways in which policy can bring about change.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.niesr.ac.uk/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directors, Presidents and Council members==
Professor Noel Hall was the first Director of the Institute, prior to its official existence in 1938, from 1937 until 1940. [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]] then became "acting" Director from 1940 but was called upon for war service in June of that year. From June 1940 to 1949, Sir Henry Clay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32438|title=Clay, Sir Henry (1883-1954)|last=Jewkes|first=John|date=20 November 2017|website=www.oxforddnb.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out the duties of Director and Chair of Council.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixty Years of Economic Research|last=Jones|first=Kit|publisher=Latimer Trend &amp; Company|year=1998|isbn=0952621339|location=Plymouth, United Kingdom|pages=1-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Institute Economic Review ==
Since 1959, the NIESR has published the ''[[National Institute Economic Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|title=National Institute Economic Review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/home/ner#|journal=NIER|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Principal topics covered by the Review include economic modelling and analysis, education and training, productivity and competitiveness, and workings of the international economy. Each edition Includes detailed forecasts of both UK and World Economies, a commentary, and special articles by Institute researchers and external authors.

==NiGEM==
An important output of NIESR has been a [[macroeconomic]] model called NiGEM (National Institute's Global Econometric Model)&lt;ref name="NiGEM"/&gt; which is used to produce quarterly forecasts for the UK and global [[economy]] (published in the ''[[National Institute Economic Review]]''). Forecasts are also published for various other [[OECD]] countries. The model are used by the [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Bank of England]], the OECD and [[European Central Bank]].&lt;ref name="NiGEM"&gt;https://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/forecastingmethodsandanalyticaltools.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecnmy"&gt;http://www.ecnmy.org/engage/to-eu-or-not-to-eu-that-is-the-question/&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Societe Generale]] researcher used the model to analyse the effect of falling [[Price of oil|oil prices]] on the world economy.&lt;ref name="oil"&gt;http://uk.businessinsider.com/societe-generale-oil-price-drop-effects-2014-11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nesfatin-1''' is a [[neuropeptide]] produced in the hypothalamus of mammals. It participates in the regulation of hunger and fat storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05162 |title=Identification of nesfatin-1 as a satiety molecule in the hypothalamus |year=2006 |last1=Oh-i |first1=Shinsuke |last2=Shimizu |first2=Hiroyuki |last3=Satoh |first3=Tetsurou |last4=Okada |first4=Shuichi |last5=Adachi |first5=Sachika |last6=Inoue |first6=Kinji |last7=Eguchi |first7=Hiroshi |last8=Yamamoto |first8=Masanori |last9=Imaki |first9=Toshihiro |last10=Hashimoto |first10=Koushi |last11=Tsuchiya |first11=Takafumi  |last12=Monden |first12=Tsuyoshi |last13=Horiguchi |first13=Kazuhiko |last14=Yamada |first14=Masanobu |last15=Mori |first15=Masatomo |journal=Nature |volume=443 |issue=7112 |pages=709–12 |pmid=17036007|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased nesfatin-1 in the  hypothalamus contributes to diminished hunger, a 'sense of fullness', and a potential loss of body fat and weight.

A study of metabolic effects of nesfatin-1 in rats have been done in which subjects administered nesfatin-1 ate less, used more stored fat and became more active. Nesfatin-1-induced inhibition of feeding may be mediated through the inhibition of [[orexigenic]] neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.06.084 |title=Nesfatin-1 inhibits NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus |year=2008 |last1=Price |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Samson |first2=Willis K. |last3=Ferguson |first3=Alastair V. |journal=Brain Research |volume=1230 |pages=99–106 |pmid=18625211 |pmc=2590930}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the protein stimulated insulin secretion from the pancreatic [[beta cell]]s of both rats and mice.&lt;ref name=Intro&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/JOE-10-0492 |laysource=News-Medical.Net |laysummary=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20110810/Nesfatin-1-protein-may-help-reduce-body-weight-and-blood-sugar.aspx |laydate=August 10, 2011 |title=Nesfatin-1 Exerts a Direct, Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Action on Mouse Islet Beta and MIN6 Cells |year=2011 |last1=Gonzalez |first1=R. |last2=Reingold |first2=B.

==Biochemistry==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nesfatin Sequence.gif|thumb|[[Amino acid]] sequence of human NEFA/nucleobindin2 (NUCN2)]] --&gt;
Nesfatin-1 is a [[polypeptide]] encoded in the N-terminal region of the protein precursor, Nucleobindin2 ([[NUCB2]]).
[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] human Nesfatin-1 is a 9.7 kDa protein containing 82 amino acid residues.&lt;ref name=Biochem&gt;{{cite web|last=ProSci inc|title=Nesfatin-1 Recombinant Protein|url=http://www.prosci-inc.com/Nesfatin-1-Recombinant-Protein-c-40-545|accessdate=21 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411165857/http://www.prosci-inc.com/Nesfatin-1-Recombinant-Protein-c-40-545|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nesfatin-1 is expressed in the hypothalamus, in other areas of the brain, and in [[pancreatic islets]], gastric endocrine cells and [[adipocyte]]s.

==Satiety==
Nesfatin/NUCB2 is expressed in the appetite-control [[hypothalamic nuclei]] such as [[paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN), [[arcuate nucleus]] (ARC), [[supraoptic nucleus]] (SON) of [[hypothalamus]], [[lateral hypothalamic area]] (LHA), and [[zona incerta]] in rats. Nesfatin-1 [[immunoreactivity]] was also found in the [[brainstem]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] such as [[nucleus of the solitary tract]] (NTS) and [[Dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve]].

==Brain==
Nesfatin-1 can cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] without saturation.&lt;ref name=BBB&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2007.09.005 |title=Nesfatin-1 crosses the blood–brain barrier without saturation |year=2007 |last1=Pan |first1=Weihong |last2=Hsuchou |first2=Hung |last3=Kastin |first3=Abba J. |journal=Peptides |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=2223–8 |pmid=17950952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s within the brain are in the hypothalamus and the [[solitary nucleus]], where nesfatin-1 is believed to be produced via [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors]] (PPARs). It appears there is  a relationship between nesfatin-1 and [[cannabinoid receptors]]. Nesfatin-1-induced inhibition of feeding may be mediated through the inhibition of orexigenic [[NPY]] neurons.

Nesfatin/NUCB2 expression has been reported to be modulated by starvation and re-feeding in the [[Paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) and [[supraoptic nucleus]] (SON) of the brain. Nesfatin-1 influences the excitability of a large proportion of different subpopulations of neurons located in the PVN. It is also reported that magnocellular [[oxytocin]] neurons are activated during feeding, and ICV infusion of oxytocin [[antagonist]] increases food intake, indicating a possible role of oxytocin in the regulation of feeding behavior. In addition, it is proposed that feeding-activated nesfatin-1 neurons in the PVN and SON could play an important role in the [[postprandial]] regulation of feeding behavior and energy [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=Brain-Gut&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/en.2011-1500 |title=Minireview: Nesfatin-1--An Emerging New Player in the Brain-Gut, Endocrine, and Metabolic Axis |year=2011 |last1=Stengel |first1=A. |last2=Tache |first2=Y. |journal=Endocrinology |volume=152 |issue=11 |pages=4033–8 |pmid=21862618 |pmc=3199002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxytocinergic&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2009.09.002 |title=Nesfatin-1-Regulated Oxytocinergic Signaling in the Paraventricular Nucleus Causes Anorexia through a Leptin-Independent Melanocortin Pathway |year=2009 |last1=Maejima |first1=Yuko |last2=Sedbazar |first2=Udval |last3=Suyama |first3=Shigetomo |last4=Kohno |first4=Daisuke |last5=Onaka |first5=Tatsushi |last6=Takano |first6=Eisuke |last7=Yoshida |first7=Natsu |last8=Koike |first8=Masato |last9=Uchiyama |first9=Yasuo |last10=Fujiwara |first10=Ken |last11=Yashiro |first11=Takashi |last12=Horvath |first12=Tamas L. |last13=Dietrich |first13=Marcelo O. |last14=Tanaka |first14=Shigeyasu |last15=Dezaki |first15=Katsuya |last16=Hashimoto |first16=Koushi |last17=Shimizu |first17=Hiroyuki |last18=Nakata |first18=Masanori |last19=Mori |first19=Masatomo |last20=Yada |first20=Toshihiko |last21=Yada |first21=T |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=355–65 |pmid=19883614|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nesfatin-1 immunopositive neurons are also located in the [[arcuate nucleus]] (ARC). Nesfatin-1 immunoreactive neurons in the ARC are activated by simultaneous injection of [[ghrelin]] and desacyl ghrelin, nesfatin-1 may be involved in the desacyl ghrelin-induced inhibition of the [[orexigenic]] effect of peripherally administered ghrelin in freely fed rat.

Nesfatin-1 was co-expressed with [[melanin]] concentrating hormone ([[Melanin-concentrating hormone|MCH]]) in [[Tuberal region of hypothalamus|tuberal hypothalamic]] neurons. Nesfatin-1 co-expressed in MCH neurons may play a complex role not only in the regulation of food intake, but also in other essential integrative brain functions involving MCH signaling, ranging from autonomic regulation, stress, mood, cognition to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimizu|first1=H|last2=Ohsaki|first2=A|last3=Oh-I|first3=S|last4=Okada|first4=S|last5=Mori|first5=M|title=A new anorexigenic protein, nesfatin-1.|journal=Peptides|date=May 2009|volume=30|issue=5|pages=995–8|pmid=19452636|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2009.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is growing evidence that nesfatin-1 may play an important role in the regulation of food intake and [[Glucose metabolism|glucose homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=Leptin&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/en.2008-0598 |title=Peripheral Administration of Nesfatin-1 Reduces Food Intake in Mice: The Leptin-Independent Mechanism |year=2008 |last1=Shimizu |first1=H. |last2=Oh-i |first2=S. |last3=Hashimoto |first3=K. |last4=Nakata |first4=M. |last5=Yamamoto |first5=S. |last6=Yoshida |first6=N. |last7=Eguchi |first7=H. |last8=Kato |first8=I. |last9=Inoue |first9=K. |last10=Satoh |first10=T. |last11=Okada |first11=S. |last12=Yamada |first12=M. |last13=Yada |first13=T. |last14=Mori |first14=M. |journal=Endocrinology |volume=150 |issue=2 |pages=662–71 |pmid=19176321|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, continuous infusion of nesfatin-1 into the third [[brain ventricle]] significantly decreased food intake and body weight gain in rats. In previous studies, we have also shown that plasma nesfatin-1 levels were elevated in patients with [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]] (T2DM) and associated with [[Body mass index|BMI]], plasma [[insulin]], and the homeostasis model assessment of [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref name=Plasma&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-0031-1286339 |title=Increased Plasma Levels of Nesfatin-1 in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus |year=2011 |last1=Zhang |first1=Z. |last2=Li |first2=L. |last3=Yang |first3=M. |last4=Liu |first4=H. |last5=Boden |first5=G. |last6=Yang |first6=G. |journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Diabetes |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=91–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Insulin&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/db11-1755 |title=Nesfatin-1 Action in the Brain Increases Insulin Sensitivity Through Akt/AMPK/TORC2 Pathway in Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance |year=2012 |last1=Yang |first1=M. |last2=Zhang |first2=Z. |last3=Wang |first3=C. |last4=Li |first4=K. |last5=Li |first5=S. |last6=Boden |first6=G. |last7=Li |first7=L. |last8=Yang |first8=G. |journal=Diabetes |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=1959–68 |pmid=22688332 |pmc=3402309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found that central nesfatin-1 resulted in a marked suppression of hepatic [[PEPCK]] [[mRNA]] and protein levels in both standard diet (SD) and high fat diet (HFD) rats but failed to alter [[glucose 6-phosphatase]] (G-6-Pase) activity and protein expression. Central nesfatin-1 appeared to antagonize the effect of HFD on increasing PEPCK [[gene expression]] [[in vivo]]. In agreement with decreasing PEPCK gene expression, central nesfatin-1 also resulted in a reduced PEPCK [[enzyme]] activity, further confirming that it affected PEPCK rather than G-6-Pase.&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;

The part of the glucose entering the [[liver]] is [[phosphorylated]] by [[glucokinase]] and then dephosphorylated by G-6-Pase. This [[futile cycle]] between glucokinase and G-6-Pase is named glucose cycling, and it accounts for the difference between the total [[flux]] through G-6-Pase and glucose production. G-6-Pase [[catalyze]]s the last step in both [[gluconeogenesis]] and [[glycogenolysis]], and PEPCK is responsible only for gluconeogenesis. In this study, central nesfatin-1 led to a marked suppression of [[hepatic]] PEPCK protein and activity, but failed to alter hepatic G-6-Pase activity, suggesting that PEPCK may be more sensitive to short-term central nesfatin-1 exposure than G-6-Pase. In addition, we also considered that the suppression of HGP by central nesfatin-1 was dependent on an inhibition of the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] flux through G-6-Pase and not on a decrease in the amount of G-6-Pase enzyme. Thus, in SD and HFD rats, central nesfatin-1 may have decreased glucose production mainly via decreasing gluconeogenesis and PEPCK activity.&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;

Recently, it has been reported that ICV nesfatin-1 produced a dose-dependent delay of [[gastric emptying]].&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Food&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/en.2009-0578 |title=Central Nesfatin-1 Reduces Dark-Phase Food Intake and Gastric Emptying in Rats: Differential Role of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor2 Receptor |year=2009 |last1=Stengel |first1=A. |last2=Goebel |first2=M. |last3=Wang |first3=L. |last4=Rivier |first4=J. |last5=Kobelt |first5=P. |last6=Monnikes |first6=H. |last7=Lambrecht |first7=N.

To further delineate the mechanism by which central nesfatin-1 modulates glucose homeostasis, we assessed the effects of central nesfatin-1 on the phosphorylation of several proteins in the [[INSR]] → [[IRS-1]] → [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] → [[Akt]] [[signaling cascade]] in the liver. We found that central nesfatin-1 significantly augmented InsR and IRS-1 [[tyrosine]] phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that central nesfatin-1 in both SD and HFD rats resulted in a stimulation of liver insulin signaling that could account for the increased [[insulin sensitivity]] and improving glucose metabolism.&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;

[[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] is a key regulator of both [[lipid]] and glucose metabolism. It has been referred to as a metabolic master switch, because its activity is regulated by the energy status of the cell. In this study, we demonstrate that central nesfatin-1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of AMPK accompanied by a marked suppression of hepatic PEPCK activity, mRNA, and protein levels in both SD and HFD rats. Notably, central nesfatin-1 appears to prevent the obesity-driven decrease in phospho-AMPK levels in HFD-fed rats. Because hepatic AMPK controls glucose homeostasis mainly through the inhibition of gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production, the suppressive effect of central nesfatin-1 on the HGP (Hepatic Glucose Production) can be attributed partly to its ability to suppress the expression of PEPCK mRNA and protein through AMPK activation. Furthermore, the activation of AMPK has been shown to enhance glucose uptake in [[skeletal muscle]]. Therefore, increased AMPK phosphorylation by central nesfatin-1 may also have been responsible for the improved glucose uptake in muscle.&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;

[[Akt]] is a key effector of insulin-induced inhibition of HGP and stimulation of muscle glucose uptake. We therefore examined the effects of central nesfatin-1 on Akt phosphorylation [[in vivo]]. We found that central nesfatin-1 produced a pronounced increase in insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in the liver of HFD-fed rats. This increase was paralleled by an increase in muscle glucose uptake and inhibition of HGP. This provided correlative evidence that Akt activation may be involved in nesfatin-1 signaling and its effects on glucose homeostasis and [[insulin sensitivity]].&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;

The [[mTOR pathway]] has emerged as a molecular mediator of [[insulin resistance]], which can be activated by both insulin and nutrients. It is needed to fully activate AKT and consists of two discrete protein complexes, [[TORC1]] and [[TORC2]], only one of which, TORC1, binds [[rapamycin]]. In addition to mTOR, the TORC2 complex contains [[RICTOR]], [[mLST8]], and [[SIN1]] and regulates insulin action and Akt phosphorylation. Thus, mTOR sits at a critical juncture between insulin and nutrient signaling, making it important both for insulin signaling downstream from Akt and for nutrient sensing. Until now, it has not been known whether nesfatin-1 affects activation of mTOR. To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the insulin-sensitizing effects of ICV nesfatin-1, we assessed mTOR and TORC2 phosphorylation in liver samples of SD- and HFD-fed animals. Both mTOR and TORC2 phosphorylations were increased in livers from these rats, demonstrating activation of mTOR and TORC2 by central nesfatin-1 in vivo. As mTOR [[kinase]] activity is required for Akt phosphorylation, the observed increased Akt phosphorylation may have been caused by the concomitant activation of the mTOR/TORC2. Thus, it's postulated that the mTOR/TORC2 plays a role as a [[negative-feedback]] mechanism in the regulation of metabolism and insulin sensitivity mediated by central nesfatin-1.&lt;ref name="Insulin"/&gt;

In [[observational astronomy]], an '''observation arc''' (or '''arc length''') is the time period between the first and most recent (last) observation, tracing the body's path. It is usually given in days or years. The term is mostly used in the discovery and tracking of [[asteroids]] and [[comets]].

The observation arc determines how accurately known the orbit of the object is.  A very short arc could describe objects in a wide variety of orbits, at many distances from Earth.  In some cases, there have been objects whose initial arc was insufficient to determine if the object was in orbit around the Earth, or orbiting out in the [[asteroid belt]]. With a 1-day observation arc, {{mpl|2004 PR|107}} was thought to be a trans-Neptunian [[dwarf planet]], but is now known to be a 1&amp;nbsp;km main-belt asteroid. With an observation arc of 3 days {{mpl|2004 BX|159}} was thought to be a [[Mars-crossing asteroid]] that could be a threat to Earth, but it is now known to be a main-belt asteroid.

An observation arc less than 30 days can make it difficult to recover an [[Inner Solar System]] object more than a year after the last observation, and may result in a [[lost minor planet]]. Due to their greater distance from the Sun and slow movement across the sky, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s with observation arcs less than several years often have poorly constrained orbits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/astrokiwi/status/981438339420250114 Astronomer Michele Bannister] (4 April 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Operational Street Pollution Model''' ('''OSPM''') is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in so-called street canyons. It was developed by the [[National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark]], Department of Atmospheric Environment, Aarhus University. As a result of reorganisation at Aarhus University the model has been maintained by the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University since 2011. For about 20 years, OSPM has been used in many countries for studying traffic pollution, performing analyses of field campaign measurements, studying efficiency of pollution abatement strategies, carrying out exposure assessments and as reference in comparisons to other models. OSPM is generally considered as state-of-the-art in practical street pollution modelling.

==Description==

[[File:OSPM fig1.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Principle flow in OSPM.|Figure 1: Principal flow pattern inside a street canyon for near perpendicular roof level wind direction and schematic picture of the main processes assumed in ''OSPM''.]]
In OSPM concentrations of traffic-emitted pollution is calculated using a combination of a plume model for the direct contribution and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street.

The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are calculated taking into account NO-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; chemistry and the residence time of pollutants in the street. The model is designed to work with input and output in the form of one-hour averages.

The main principles in the model are depicted in ''Figure 1'' for the case of a wind direction nearly perpendicular to the street canyon. A receptor point in leeward position is affected by the direct plume showing considerably higher concentrations than a receptor in windward position being exposed to the less concentrated recirculating air.

The turbulence produced by the moving traffic (TPT) is acting in addition to the turbulence created by the roof level wind. This leads to a faster dispersion of the direct plume but also to an improved air exchange at roof level between the street canyon and the background air.

'''Personality''' is defined as the characteristic set of [[behavior]]s, [[cognition]]s, and [[emotion]]al patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corr|first1=Philip J.|last2=Matthews|first2=Gerald|title=The Cambridge handbook of personality psychology|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=978-0-521-86218-9|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadock|first1=Benjamin|last2=Sadock|first2=Virginia|last3=Ruiz|first3=Pedro|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9781451100471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by [[Raymond Cattell]] define personality as the traits that predict a person's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally based approaches define personality through learning and habits.  Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The study of the psychology of personality, called [[personality psychology]], attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior.  Many approaches have been taken on to study personality, including biological, cognitive, learning and trait based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches.  Personality psychology is divided among the first theorists, with a few influential theories being posited by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Gordon Allport]], [[Hans Eysenck]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]].

==Measuring==
Personality can be determined through a variety of tests. However, dimensions of personality and scales of personality tests vary and often are poorly defined. Examples of such tests are the: [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Inventory]] (BFI), [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI-2), [[Rorschach test|Rorschach Inkblot test]], [[Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span lang="PL"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.archivespp.pl/uploads/images/2009_11_1/21_p_Archives_1_09.pdf|vauthors=Aleksandrowicz JW, Klasa K, Sobański JA, Stolarska D|title=KON-2006 Neurotic Personality Questionnaire|journal=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy|year=2009|volume=1|pages=21–2}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]] test, or [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck's]] Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R).

==Five-factor model==
Personality is often broken into statistically-identified factors called the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]], which are [[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]] (or emotional stability). These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person's genetics rather than the effects of one's environment.&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Briley2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Briley, D. A., Tucker-Drob, E. M.|year=2014|title= Genetic and environmental continuity in personality development: A meta-analysis|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=5|pages=1303–31|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263324524_Genetic_and_Environmental_Continuity_in_Personality_Development_A_Meta-Analysis|doi=10.1037/a0037091|pmid=24956122|pmc=4152379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion seen in adults can also be seen in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality.&lt;ref name="Holder &amp; Klassen"&gt;Holder &amp; Klassen 2010, p. 419–439.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas McCrae and Costa's Big Five model assesses personality traits in adults, the EAS (emotionality, activity, and sociability) model is used to assess temperament in children. This model measures levels of emotionality, activity, sociability, and shyness in children. The personality theorists consider temperament EAS model similar to the Big Five model in adults; however, this might be due to a conflation of concepts of personality and temperament as described above. Findings show that high degrees of sociability and low degrees of shyness are equivalent to adult extraversion, and correlate with higher levels of [[life satisfaction]] in children.

Another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect. Extraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of this study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions.&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan"&gt;Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan, p. 290-303.&lt;/ref&gt; This study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person's dispositional nature. In other words, the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited and non-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts' experience of positive affect increased&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan" /&gt; whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. [[Ego depletion]], or cognitive fatigue, is the use of one's energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one's inner disposition. When people act in a contrary fashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate emotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Zelenski, Santoro, &amp; Whelan" /&gt;

One question that has been posed is why extraverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of explanations attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories.&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird"&gt;Lucas &amp; Baird 2004, p. 473-485.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental theory suggests that extraverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird&lt;ref name="Lucas &amp; Baird" /&gt; found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect. 	

Research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness. Self-esteem and self-efficacy are two such mediators. Self-efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al"&gt;Strobel, Tumasjan, &amp; Sporrle, p. 43-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy is one's belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired results, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al" /&gt; However, the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and subjective happiness is only partially mediated by self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Strobel et al" /&gt; This implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits. Another such factor may be self-esteem. Individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion.&lt;ref&gt;Joshanloo &amp; Afshari 2009, p. 105-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator. Mood maintenance, the ability to maintain one's average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation (meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals), has been found to be a stronger force in extraverts.&lt;ref name="Lischetzke &amp; Eid"&gt;Lischetzke &amp; Eid 2006, p. 1127-1162.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. Another implication of this finding is that extraverts' positive moods last longer than those of introverts.&lt;ref name="Lischetzke &amp; Eid" /&gt;

==Developmental biological model==

Modern conceptions of personality, such as the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]] have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning.  The four temperaments, ''harm avoidance'', ''reward dependence'', ''novelty seeking'' and ''persistence'' are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic personality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories.  While factor based approaches to personality have yielded models that account for significant variance, the developmental biological model has been argued to better reflect underlying biological processes.  Distinct genetic, neurochemical and neuroanatomical correlates responsible for each temperamental trait have been observed, unlike with five factor models.

The harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations.  Novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity.  Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum, and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain.  Reward dependence has been linked with the [[oxytocin]] system, with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin related regions of the [[hypothalamus]].  Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-[[mPFC]] connectivity, increased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B|first1=Sadock|last2=V|first2=Sadock|last3=P|first3=Ruiz|editor1-last=Cloninger|editor1-first=R|editor2-last=Svrakic|editor2-first=D|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolter Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|chapter=Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental influences ==
It has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed.&lt;ref name="Briley2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jeronimus, B. F., Riese, H., Sanderman, R., Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/107/4/751|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;

One study that has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect and shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth's [[Strange situation|Strange Situation]] experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment, labelled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children and Their Development|last=Kail|first=Robert|last2=Barnfield|first2=Anne|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=9780205993024|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Rich Harris]]'s group socialization theory postulates that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child's personality rather than the parental style or home environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Judith Rich|date=1995|title=Where is the child's environment? A group socialization theory of development.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.102.3.458|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=3|pages=458–489|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.458|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessuya Kawamoto's ''Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security'' talked about laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality on and life experiences. The assessments suggested that "the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security".&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto, Tetsuya. "Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security." Japanese Psychological Research, vol. 58, no. 2, Apr. 2016, pp. 218-231. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/jpr.12110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural studies==
There has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture. Some people think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in cross-culture study. On the other hand, others believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an effort is being made to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of "the Big Five".&lt;ref&gt;[[David C. Funder|Funder, D.C.]], (2001). Personality. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2001. 52:197–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological bases of human personality.&lt;ref&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Allik, I. U. (2002). The five-factor model of personality across cultures. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; If personality traits are unique to individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality measures.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Costa Jr, P. T. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American psychologist, 52(5), 509.&lt;/ref&gt; When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt;

Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, D. P. 2007"&gt;Schmitt, D. P., Allik, J., McCrae, R. R., &amp; Benet-Martínez, V. (2007). The geographic distribution of Big Five personality traits: Patterns and profiles of human self-description across 56 nations. Journal of cross-cultural psychology, 38(2), 173-212.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some differences across culture but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt; For example, the term "feeling blue" is used to describe sadness in more Westernized cultures, but does not translate to other languages.  Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures.&lt;ref name="Schmitt, D. P. 2007"/&gt;  Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found.&lt;ref name="Church, A. T. 2000"&gt;Church, A. T. (2000). Culture and personality: Toward an integrated cultural trait psychology. Journal of Personality, 68(4), 651-703.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions.&lt;ref name="Church, A. T. 2000"/&gt; Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support.&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. 1997"/&gt;

==Historical development of concept==
The modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the [[Renaissance]], an essential element in [[modernity]]. In contrast, the Medieval European's sense of [[self]] was linked to a network of social roles: "the [[Medieval household|household]], the [[Kinship|kinship network]], the [[guild]], the [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporation]] – these were the building blocks of personhood", [[Stephen Greenblatt]] observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career of [[Lucretius]]' poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'': "at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:3, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; "Dependent on the [[family]], the individual alone was nothing," Jacques Gélis observes.&lt;ref&gt;Gélis, "The Child: from anonymity to individuality", in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, ''A History of Private Life III: Passions of the Renaissance'' 1989:309.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperament and philosophy==
[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|William James (1842-1910)]]
[[William James]] (1842-1910) argued that '''temperament''' explains a great deal of the controversies in the history of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers. Despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias, James explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether a philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and Other Essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental make-up ===
James argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia,  but focused on philosophy in his 1907 lectures on ''[[Pragmatism]]''. In fact, James' lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of each camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and may be possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp.  The "mental make-up" (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is described as "tender-minded" and "going by "principles," and that of empiricist philosophers is described as "tough-minded" and "going by "facts." James distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament. Furthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James' purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy, and is not exhaustive.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"/&gt;
		
===Empiricists and rationalists===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|John Locke (1632–1704)]]
According to James, the ''temperament'' of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers differed fundamentally from the ''temperament'' of [[empiricism|empiricist]] philosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers toward ''refinement'' and ''superficiality'' never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of ''closed systems'', and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind, for whom perfection is far off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationalism is regarded as ''pretension'', and a temperament most inclined to ''abstraction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperament of rationalists, according to James, led to sticking with logic.

[[empiricism|Empiricists]], on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather than logic. British empiricist [[John Locke|John Locke's]]  (1632–1704) explanation of personal identity provides an example of what James referred to. Locke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis of a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a person, is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or substance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it "always accompanies thinking, it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains constant in different places at different times. Thus his explanation of personal identity is in terms of experience as James indeed maintained is the case for most empiricists.
[[File:Benedictus (Baruch) Spinoza (anoniem schilderij, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag), Bestanddeelnr 935-0843.jpg|thumb|Benedictus Spinoza (1632–1677)]]
Rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who distinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, [[Rene Descartes]]  (1596–1650) agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person "for fear of making brutes thinking things too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=William|title=Pragmatism and other essays|date=1970|publisher=Washington Square Press|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke's successor [[David Hume]]  (1711–1776), and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives.&lt;ref name="Pragmatism and Other Essays"/&gt; However, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus [[David Hume|An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding]] because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding|date=1955|publisher=Liberal Arts Press Inc|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]] himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought, and thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty mustn't be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Descartes|first1=Rene|title=Meditations on the First Philosophy|date=1974|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationalist philosopher [[Spinoza|Benedictus Spinoza]] (1632–1677) argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but existed only for actually existing things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ideas of non-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an idea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza's rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives the "ideas of the modifications of body," in describing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On the contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=241|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mind is not the free cause of its actions for Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=253|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza equates the will with the understanding, and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as error which results from the individual's misunderstanding of the nature of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedictus|title=The Ethics|date=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=256|edition=The Rationalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==

The [[biological basis of personality]] is the theory that anatomical structures located in the [[brain]] contribute to personality traits. This stems from [[neuropsychology]], which studies how the structure of the brain relates to various psychological processes and behaviors. For instance, in [[human|human beings]], the [[frontal lobe]]s are responsible for foresight and anticipation, and the [[occipital lobe]]s are responsible for processing visual information. In addition, certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality. For example, the [[hormone]] [[testosterone]] is important for sociability, affectivity, [[aggression|aggressiveness]], and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Funder|first=David|title=PERSONALITY|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=February 2001|volume=52|issue=1|pages=197–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of the brain cortex it is associated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeYoung|first=Colin G.|title=Testing Predictions From Personality Neuroscience: Brain Structures and the Big Five|journal=Psychological Science|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=6|pages=820–828|doi=10.1177/0956797610370159|pmid=20435951|pmc=3049165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a confusion among some psychologists who conflate personality with temperament. Temperament traits that are based on weak neurochemical imbalances within neurotransmitter systems are much more stable, consistent in behavior and show up in early childhood; they can't be changed easily but can be compensated for in behavior. In contrast to that, personality traits and features are the product of the socio-cultural development of humans and can be learned and/or changed.

== Personology ==
Personology confers a multidimensional, complex, and comprehensive approach to personality. From a holistic perspective, personology studies personality as a whole, as a system, but in the same time through all its components, levels and spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H.A. (1938). Explorations in Personality. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strack, S. (2005). Handbook of Personology and Psychopathology. Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychiatry==

The [[population dynamics]] of [[Pest (organism)#Insects|pest insects]] is a subject of interest to farmers, agricultural economists, ecologists, and those concerned with animal welfare.

==Factors affecting populations==

[[Image:Jblarva.jpg|thumb|150px|Japanese beetle larva]]

* '''Density-independent''': Affect a population equally regardless of its density. Examples:&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Population&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=John R.|title=Population Dynamics|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/ecology/popn_dyn.html|website=General Entomology course at North Carolina State University|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=8 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A [[Insect winter ecology|winter freeze]] may kill a constant fraction of [[potato leafhoppers]] in a peanut field regardless of the total number of leafhoppers.
** [[Japanese beetle]] larvae survive well with lots of summer rain.
** Temperature, humidity, fires, storms, dissolved oxygen for aquatic species.
* '''[[Density dependence|Density-dependent]]''': Affect a population more or less as the population is bigger. Examples:&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Population /&gt;
** A bigger population may be more vulnerable to diseases and parasites.
** A bigger population may have more [[intraspecific competition]], while a smaller population may have more [[interspecific competition]].
** Emigration from the population may increase as it becomes more crowded.

==Life tables==

[[File:Helicoverpa zea caterpillar.jpg|thumb|60px|''Helicoverpa zea'' larva feeding on corn]]

A '''[[life table]]''' shows how and how many insects die as they mature from eggs to adults. It helps with pest control by identifying at what life stage pest insects are most vulnerable and how mortality can be increased.&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Life&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=John R.|title=Life Tables|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/ecology/lifetables.html|website=General Entomology course at North Carolina State University|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=8 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''cohort life table''' tracks organisms through the stages of life, while a '''static life table''' shows the distribution of life stages among the population at a single point in time.&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;

Following is an example of a cohort life table based on field data from Vargas and Nishida (1980).&lt;ref name=VargasNishida1980 /&gt; The overall mortality rate was 94.8%, but this is probably an underestimate because the study collected the pupae in cups, and these may have protected them from birds, mice, harsh weather, and so on.&lt;ref name=VargasNishida1980 /&gt;

===Life expectancy===

From a life table we can calculate '''life expectancy''' as follows. Assume the stages &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly spaced. The average proportion &lt;math&gt;L_x&lt;/math&gt; of organisms alive at stage &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; between beginning and end is&lt;ref name=Elzinga&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elzinga|first1=Charles|title=Population Biology: Life Tables &amp; Theoretical Populations|url=https://www.msu.edu/course/lbs/158h/manual/populations.pdf|website=Laboratory Manual for Honors Organismal Biology|accessdate=17 June 2014|pages=37–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;L_x = \frac{l_x + l_{x+1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
The total number &lt;math&gt;T_x&lt;/math&gt; of future stages to be lived by individuals at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and older is&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_x = L_x + L_{x+1} + L_{x+2} + ...&lt;/math&gt; .
Then the life expectancy &lt;math&gt;e_x&lt;/math&gt; at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e_x = \frac{T_x}{l_x}&lt;/math&gt;.
We could have done the same computation with raw numbers of individuals rather than proportions.

===Basic reproductive rate===

If we further know the number &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt; of eggs produced (fecundity) at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we can calculate the eggs produced per surviving individual &lt;math&gt;m_x&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt;m_x = \frac{F_x}{a_x}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;a_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of individuals alive at that stage.

The '''basic reproductive rate''' &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt; also known as the '''replacement rate''' of a population, is the ratio of daughters to mothers. If it's greater than 1, the population is increasing. In a stable population the replacement rate should hover close to 1.&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Life /&gt; We can calculate it from life-table data as&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;R_0 = \sum_x l_x m_x&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because each &lt;math&gt;l_x m_x&lt;/math&gt; product computes (first-generation parents at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;)/(first-generation eggs) times (second-generation eggs produced by age-&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; parents)/(first-generation parents at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population size and &lt;math&gt;N_T&lt;/math&gt; is the population size after a generation, then&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;R_0 = \frac{N_T}{N_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Generation time===
{{Main|Generation time}}
The '''cohort generation time''' &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is the average duration between when a parent is born and when its child is born. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is measured in years, then&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_c = \frac{\sum_x x l_x m_x}{\sum_x l_x m_x}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Intrinsic rate of increase===

If &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; remains relatively stable over generations, we can use it to approximate the [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic rate of increase]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; for the population:&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;r \approx \frac{\ln R_0}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because
: &lt;math&gt;\ln R_0 = \ln \frac{N_T}{N_0} = \ln \frac{N_0 + \Delta N}{N_0} = \ln \left(1 + \frac{\Delta N}{N_0} \right) \approx \frac{\Delta N}{N_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
where the approximation follows from the [[Mercator series]]. &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is a change in time, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have
: &lt;math&gt;r \approx \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} \frac{1}{N_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is the discrete definition of the intrinsic rate of increase.

==Growth models==

In general, population growth roughly follows one of these trends:&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Population /&gt;
* [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|Logistic growth]] leveling out at some [[carrying capacity]].
* [[Overshoot (population)|Overshoot]] ("boom" and "bust" cycles).
* Oscillation at or below the carrying capacity.

Insect pest growth rates are heavily influenced by temperature and rainfall, among other variables. Sometimes pest populations grow rapidly and become outbreaks.&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;{{cite web|title=Insect pest population dynamics|url=http://weslaco.tamu.edu/research-programs/entomology/subtropical/population/|website=Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Weslaco|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree-day calculations===

Because insects are [[ectothermic]], "temperature is probably the single most important environmental factor influencing insect behavior, distribution, development, survival, and reproduction."&lt;ref name=PetzoldtSeaman2006 /&gt; As a result, [[growing degree-day]]s are commonly used to estimate insect development, often relative to a [[Wiktionary:biofix|biofix]] point,&lt;ref name=PetzoldtSeaman2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curtis Petzoldt|author2=Abby Seaman|title=Climate Change and Agriculture: Promoting Practical and Profitable Responses|date=2006|publisher=University of Vermont Extension and New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|url=http://umaine.edu/oxford/files/2012/01/III.2Insects.Pathogens1.pdf|chapter=Climate Change Effects on Insects and Pathogens}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., a biological milestone, such as when the insect comes out of pupation in spring.&lt;ref name=TreeFruitBiofix&gt;{{cite web|title=Tree Fruit Insect Biofix Dates|url=http://utahpests.usu.edu/ipm/htm/fruits/biofix|website=Utah Pests|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree-days can help with pest control.&lt;ref name=Pruess1983&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pruess|first1=Kenneth P.|title=Day-degree Methods for Pest Management|journal=Environmental Entomology|date=1 Jun 1983|volume=12|issue=3|pages=613–619|doi=10.1093/ee/12.3.613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stenotus.binotatus.jpg|thumb|''[[Stenotus binotatus]]'', a [[plant bug]] in the group [[Heteroptera]]]]

Yamamura and Kiritani approximated the development rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref name=YamamuraKiritani1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kohji Yamamura|author2=Keizi Kiritani|title=A simple method to estimate the potential increase in the number of generations under global warming in temperate zones|journal=Applied Entomology and Zoology|date=1998|volume=33|issue=2|pages=289–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;r = \begin{cases} \frac{T-T_0}{K}, &amp; T \geq T_0 \\ 0, &amp; T &lt; T_0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; being the current temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; being the base temperature for the species, and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; being a thermal constant for the species. A generation is defined as the duration required for the time-integral of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to equal 1. Using linear approximations, the authors estimate that if the temperature increased by &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; (for instance, maybe &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; = 2&amp;nbsp;°C for climate change by 2100 relative to 1990), then the increase in number of generations per year &lt;math&gt;\Delta N&lt;/math&gt; would be&lt;ref name=YamamuraKiritani1998 /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta N \approx \frac{\Delta T}{K} \left(206.7 + 12.46 (m-T_0) \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the current annual mean temperature of a location. In particular, the authors suggest that 2&amp;nbsp;°C warming might lead to, for example, about one extra generation for [[Lepidoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], two extra generations for [[Diptera]], almost three generations for [[Hymenoptera]], and almost five generations for [[Aphidoidea]]. These changes in [[voltinism]] might happen through [[biological dispersal]] and/or [[natural selection]]; the authors point to prior examples of each in Japan.&lt;ref name=YamamuraKiritani1998 /&gt;

===Geometric Brownian motion===

Sunding and Zivin model population growth of insect pests as a [[geometric Brownian motion]] (GBM) process.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Sunding|author2=Joshua Zivin|title=Insect population dynamics, pesticide use, and farmworker health|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|date=Aug 2000|volume=82|pages=527–540|doi=10.1111/0002-9092.00044}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is stochastic in order to account for the variability of growth rates as a function of external conditions like weather. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the current insect population, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic growth rate]], and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a variance coefficient, the authors assume that
: &lt;math&gt;dX = \alpha X dt + \sigma X dz&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; is an increment of time, and &lt;math&gt;dz = \xi_t \sqrt{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is an increment of a [[Wiener process]], with &lt;math&gt;\xi_t&lt;/math&gt; being [[Standard normal deviate|standard-normal]] distributed. In this model, short-run population changes are dominated by the stochastic term, &lt;math&gt;\sigma X dz&lt;/math&gt;, but long-run changes are dominated by the trend term, &lt;math&gt;\alpha X dt&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt;

After solving this equation, we [[Geometric Brownian motion#Properties|find that]] the population at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X_t&lt;/math&gt;, is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normally distributed]]:
: &lt;math&gt;X_t \sim \operatorname{Log-\mathcal{N}}\left(X_0 e^{\alpha t}, X_0^2 e^{2 \alpha t} (e^{\sigma^2 t} - 1)\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt;

[[File:Lettuce aphid.jpg|thumb|[[Lettuce aphid]]]]

As a case study, the authors consider [[mevinphos]] application on leaf lettuce in [[Salinas Valley]], California for the purpose of controlling [[aphids]]. Previous research by other authors found that daily percentage growth of the [[green peach aphid]] could be modeled as an increasing linear function of average daily temperature. Combined with the fact that temperature is normally distributed, this agreed with the GBM equations described above, and the authors derived that &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0.1199&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 0.1152&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt; Since the expected population based on the log-normal distribution grows with &lt;math&gt;e^{\alpha t}&lt;/math&gt;, this implies an aphid doubling time of &lt;math&gt;\ln 2 / 0.1199 = 5.8&lt;/math&gt; days. Note that other literature has found aphid generation times to lie roughly in the range of 4.7 to 5.8 days.&lt;ref name=Li1995&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=Tang|title=Chapter 6: Shortest Generation Time|url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_06.shtml|website=The University of Florida Book of Insect Records|accessdate=16 June 2014|date=8 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeated outbreak cycles===

A 2013 study analyzed population dynamics of the smaller [[Adoxophyes honmai|tea tortrix]], a moth pest that infests tea plantations, especially in Japan. The data consisted of counts of adult moths captured with [[Insect trap#Light traps|light traps]] every 5–6 days at the Kagoshima tea station in Japan from 1961-2012. Peak populations were 100 to 4000 times higher than at their lowest levels. A [[wavelet]] decomposition showed a clear, relatively stationary annual cycle in the populations, as well as non-stationary punctuations between late April and early October, representing 4-6 outbreaks per year of this [[Voltinism|multivoltine]] species.&lt;ref name=NelsonEtAl2013 /&gt; The cycles result from [[Overshoot (population)|population overshoot]].&lt;ref name=Messer2013 /&gt;

These moths have stage-structured development life cycles, and a traditional hypothesis suggests that these cycles should be most synchronized across the population in the spring due to the preceding effects of cold winter months, and as the summer progresses, the life stages become more randomly assorted.&lt;ref name=NelsonEtAl2013 /&gt; This is often what's observed in North America.&lt;ref name=Messer2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=A'ndrea Elyse|title=Temperature alters population dynamics of common plant pests|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/283282/2013/08/01/research/temperature-alters-population-dynamics-common-plant-pests|accessdate=17 June 2014|agency=Penn State News|date=1 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study observed instead that populations were ''more'' correlated as the season progressed, perhaps because temperature fluctuations enforced synchrony. The authors found that when temperatures first increased above ~15&amp;nbsp;°C in the spring, the population dynamics crossed a [[Hopf bifurcation]] from stability to repeated outbreak cycles, until stabilization again in the fall. Above the Hopf threshold, population-cycle amplitude increased roughly linearly with temperature. This study affirmed the classic concept of temperature as a "pacemaker of all vital rates."&lt;ref name=NelsonEtAl2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=William A. Nelson|author2=Ottar N. Bjørnstad|author3=Takehiko Yamanaka|title=Recurrent Insect Outbreaks Caused by Temperature-Driven Changes in System Stability|date=16 Aug 2013|volume=341|issue=6147|pages=796–799|doi=10.1126/science.1238477|journal=Science|pmid=23907532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding life-cycle dynamics is relevant for pest control because some insecticides only work at one or two life stages of the insect.&lt;ref name=Messer2013 /&gt;

==Effects of pest control==

[[File:Lymantria dispar MHNT Fronton Male.jpg|thumb|Adult male gypsy moth]]

B. Chaney, a farm advisor in Monterey County, CA, estimates that mevinphos would kill practically all aphids in a field upon application.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt; Wyatt, citing data from various ''Arthropod Management Tests'', estimates that the percent of lettuce aphids killed is 76.1% for [[endosulfan]] and 67.0% for [[imidacloprid]].&lt;ref name=Wyatt2002&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wyatt|first1=T.

Insecticides used on gypsy moths in the 1970s had roughly a 90% kill rate.&lt;ref name=GerardiGrimm1979&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael H. Gerardi|author2=James K.

==Impact of climate change==

Temperature change is argued to be the biggest direct abiotic impact of [[climate change]] on herbivorous insects.&lt;ref name=BaleEtAl2002&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeffery S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9246">A '''reference model''' in [[systems engineering|systems]], [[enterprise engineering|enterprise]], and [[software engineering]] is an abstract framework or domain-specific ontology consisting of an interlinked set of clearly defined concepts produced by an expert or body of experts in order to encourage clear communication.  A reference model can represent the component parts of any consistent idea, from business functions to system components, as long as it represents a complete set.  This frame of reference can then be used to communicate ideas clearly among members of the same community.

Reference models are often illustrated as a set of concepts with some indication of the relationships between the concepts.

== Overview ==
According to [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) a reference model is "an abstract framework for understanding significant relationships among the entities of some environment, and for the development of consistent standards or specifications supporting that environment. A reference model is based on a small number of unifying concepts and may be used as a basis for education and explaining standards to a non-specialist.  A reference model is not directly tied to any standards, technologies or other concrete implementation details, but it does seek to provide a common semantics that can be used unambiguously across and between different implementations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS SOA Reference Model|url=http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/soa-rm/faq.php|publisher=OASIS SOA Technical Committee|accessdate=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of concepts rolled up into that of a 'reference model.'  Each of these concepts is important:
* ''Abstract'': a reference model is abstract.  It provides information about environments of a certain kind.  A reference model describes the type or kind of entities that may occur in such an environment, not the particular entities that actually do occur in a specific environment.  For example, when describing the architecture of a particular house (which is a specific environment of a certain kind), an actual exterior wall may have dimensions and materials, but the concept of a wall (type of entity) is part of the reference model.  One must understand the concept of a wall in order to build a house that has walls.
* ''Entities and relationships'': A reference model describes both types of entities (things that exist) and their relationships (how they connect, interact with one another, and exhibit joint properties).  A list of entity types, by itself, doesn't provide enough information to serve as a reference model.
* ''Within an environment'': A reference model does not attempt to describe "all things."  A reference model is used to clarify "things within an environment" or a problem space.  To be useful, a reference model should include a clear description of the problem that it solves, and the concerns of the stakeholders who need to see the problem get solved.
* ''Technology agnostic'': A reference model's usefulness is limited if it makes assumptions about the technology or platforms in place in a particular computing environment.  A reference model typically is intended to promote understanding a class of problems, not specific solutions for those problems.  As such, it must aid the process of imagining and evaluating a variety of potential solutions in order to assist the practitioner.  Note: That does not preclude the development of a reference model that describes a set of software applications, because the problem space may be "how to manage a set of software applications."

== The uses of a reference model ==

There are many uses for a reference model.  One use is to create standards for both the objects that inhabit the model and their relationships to one another.  By creating standards, the work of engineers and developers who need to create objects that behave according to the standard is made easier.  Software can be written that meets a standard, and developers can copy that software to use it again, or build a [[software factory]] that generates that code.  When done well, a standard can make use of [[design patterns]] that support key qualities of software, such as the ability to extend the software in an inexpensive way.

Another use of a reference model is to educate.  Using a reference model, leaders in software development can help break down a large problem space into smaller problems that can be understood, tackled, and refined.  Developers who are new to a particular set of problems can quickly learn what the different problems are, and can focus on the problems that they are being asked to solve, while trusting that other areas are well understood and rigorously constructed.  The level of trust is important to allow software developers to efficiently focus on their work.

A third use of a reference model is to improve communication between people.  A reference model breaks up a problem into entities, or "things that exist all by themselves."  This is often an explicit recognition of concepts that many people already share, but when created in an explicit manner, a reference model is useful by defining how these concepts differ from, and relate to, one another.  This improves communication between individuals involved in using these concepts.

A fourth use of a reference model is to create clear roles and responsibilities.  By creating a model of entities and their relationships, an organization can dedicate specific individuals or teams, making them responsible for solving a problem that concerns a specific set of entities.  For example, if a reference model describes a set of business measurements needed to create a [[balanced scorecard]], then each measurement can be assigned to a specific business leader.  That allows a senior manager to hold each of their team members responsible for producing high quality results.
  
A fifth use of a reference model is to allow the comparison of different things.  By breaking up a problem space into basic concepts, a reference model can be used to examine two different solutions to that problem.  In doing so, the component parts of a solution can be discussed in relation to one another.  For example, if a reference model describes computer systems that help track contacts between a business and their customers, then a reference model can be used by a business to decide which of five different software products to purchase, based on their needs.  A reference model, in this example, could be used to compare how well each of the candidate solutions can be configured to meet the needs of a particular business process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], the '''Thurstone scale''' was the first formal technique to measure an [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. It was developed by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] in 1928, as a means of measuring attitudes towards [[religion]]. It is made up of statements about a particular issue, and each statement has a numerical value indicating how favorable or unfavorable it is judged to be. People check each of the statements to which they agree, and a [[mean]] score is computed, indicating their attitude.

==Thurstone scale==
Thurstone's method of pair comparisons can be considered a prototype of a [[normal distribution]]-based method for scaling-dominance matrices. Even though the theory behind this method is quite complex (Thurstone, 1927a), the algorithm itself is straightforward. For the basic Case V, the frequency dominance matrix is translated into proportions and interfaced with the standard scores. The scale is then obtained as a left-adjusted column marginal average of this standard score matrix (Thurstone, 1927b). The underlying rationale for the method and basis for the measurement of the "psychological scale separation between any two stimuli" derives from Thurstone's [[Law of comparative judgment]] (Thurstone, 1928).

The principal difficulty with this algorithm is its indeterminacy with respect to one-zero proportions, which return z values as plus or minus infinity, respectively. The inability of the pair comparisons algorithm to handle these cases imposes considerable limits on the applicability of the method.

The most frequent recourse when the 1.00-0.00 frequencies are encountered is their omission. Thus, e.g., Guilford (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;163) has recommended not using proportions more extreme than .977 or .023, and Edwards (1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42) has suggested that '' “if the number of judges is large, say 200 or more, then we might use pij values of .99 and .01, but with less than 200 judges, it is probably better to disregard all comparative judgments for which pij is greater than .98 or less than .02."’ '' Since the omission of such extreme values leaves empty cells in the Z matrix, the averaging procedure for arriving at the scale values cannot be applied, and an elaborate procedure for the estimation of unknown parameters is usually employed (Edwards, 1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–46). An alternative solution of this problem was suggested by Krus and Kennedy (1977).

With later developments in psychometric theory, it has become possible to employ direct methods of scaling such as application of the [[Rasch model]] or unfolding models such as the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (HCM) (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).  The Rasch model has a close conceptual relationship to Thurstone's law of comparative judgment (Andrich, 1978), the principal difference being that it directly incorporates a person parameter.  Also, the Rasch model takes the form of a logistic function rather than a cumulative normal function.

'''Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC)''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] texts and [[Tibetan literature]]. Founded in 1999 by [[E. Gene Smith]], TBRC is located in [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and hosts a digital library of the largest collection of digitized Tibetan texts in the world.&lt;ref name="Economist obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary- Gene Smith|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17899572/|publisher=The Economist | date=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBRC's [[Harvard Square]] headquarters facilitates its ongoing cooperative relationships with [[Harvard University]]. TBRC also has international offices in [[New Delhi|New Delhi, India]] and [[Kathmandu|Kathmandu, Nepal]], and a newly opened scanning and text-preservation center located within the E. Gene Smith Library at [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu|Chengdu, China]].&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=After Winding Odyssey, Tibetan Texts Find Home in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/after-winding-odyssey-tibetan-texts-find-home-in-china.html|publisher=New York Times|date=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

To preserve and share the Tibetan literary heritage through the union of technology and scholarship.

== History ==
[[File:Traditional Tibetan Texts.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Traditional Tibetan Texts]]
In the early 1960s, while working on his PhD. at the [[University of Washington]], [[E. Gene Smith]] studied with the Venerable [[Dezhung Rinpoche]]. In 1964, Dezhung Rinpoche encouraged Smith to move to India in order to seek out and study Tibetan books more directly. He gave Smith letters of introduction to show to the lamas living among the [[Tibetan diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Patron Kings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patron Kings Part IX: Gene Smith and TBRC|url=http://khyentsefoundation.org/2010/12/part-ix-gene-smith-and-tbrc/|publisher=Khyentse Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the [[U.S. Library of Congress]] hired Smith as a field director in [[New Delhi]] where he worked on the Food for Peace humanitarian effort [[Public Law 480]]. Through the program, Smith began to copy and print thousands of Tibetan texts while keeping a version of each one for his own collection. He moved from India to Indonesia in 1985 and then Egypt, along with his collection of 12,000 volumes of texts.&lt;ref name="Patron Kings"/&gt;

In 1997 Smith retired from the Library of Congress and began working to implement his vision of making the preserved texts accessible using the new scanning and digitization technologies that were, at that time, just beginning to become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Noa|title=Take Note|url=http://www.tricycle.com/-life/take-note|publisher=Tricycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 with friends including [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor and fellow [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Leonard van der Kuijp]], he founded the '''Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center''' in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Smith's texts from India that were digitized at TBRC became the foundation for Tibetan studies in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion Journal; War Resister Becomes Savior of Tibet's Literature|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/15/nyregion/religion-journal-war-resister-becomes-savior-of-tibet-s-literature.html?src=pm/|last=Stewart|first=Barbara|publisher=New York Times|date=June 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 with the support of Shelley and Donald Rubin, TBRC moved to [[New York City]] where Smith became an advisor to the [[Rubin Museum of Art]].  Major grants from the Patricia and Peter Gruber Foundation, Khyentse Foundation, and the Shelley and Donald Rubin Foundation allowed TBRC to acquire a significant number of texts, develop its archiving system, and add more professional staff. Starting as Technical Director in 2001, Jeff Wallman was personally selected by Smith to be Executive Director and was appointed by the Board of Directors in 2009.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"/&gt;

Gene Smith died on December 16, 2010. TBRC had scanned 7 million pages of Tibetan texts at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Economist obituary"/&gt;

== TBRC's Work ==
[[File:Tibetan texts and a planetary book scanner; microfilm scanner on the bottom.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Tibetan texts on a planetary book scanner next to a  microfilm scanner]]
TBRC seeks out and preserves undiscovered texts, organizes them into a library catalog system, and disseminates the library online and to remote locations on hard drives so anyone can read, print, or share the texts. Tibetan language texts are cataloged by work, genre, subject, person, and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center Digital Library|url=http://library.hds.harvard.edu/key-e-resources/tibetan-buddhist-resource-center-digital-library|publisher=Andover-Harvard Theological Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the collection contains more than 7,000 works (17,000 volumes, totaling nearly 9 million pages) of Tibetan texts.&lt;ref name="Suber"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suber and Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center Collaborate to Provide Open Access to Tibetan Literature|url=http://library.harvard.edu/08192013-1108/suber-and-tibetan-buddhist-resource-center-collaborate-provide-open-access-tibetan/|publisher=Harvard Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and students are able to study the physical qualities of the texts since the scans are searchable and zoomable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knafl|first=Anne|title=Library purchases access to important digitized Tibetan texts|url=http://news.lib.uchicago.edu/blog/2013/06/06/library-purchases-access-to-important-digitized-tibetan-texts/|publisher=University of Chicago Library News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 5,000 users from 66 countries currently access the website per day, up from 815 per day in 2006. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pages are added every year.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|url=http://khyentsefoundation.org/2010/02/spotlight-on-the-tibetan-buddhist-resource-center|publisher=Khyentse Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBRC's work was recognized by the [[Orgyen Trinley Dorje|17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje]] in a letter offering his support, gratitude, and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Elizabeth|title=BIFF 2013: Find, save, copy, paste 'Digital Dharma' tells of one scholar’s work to save thousands of Tibetan texts|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-10645-biff-2013-find-save-copy-paste.html/|publisher=Boulder Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Smith's life and TBRC were the subject of the 2012 [[documentary]] [[Digital Dharma]], directed by Dafna Yachin of Lunchbox Communications. [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] film critic John Anderson described the film as, "A divinely inspired gift... also an affectionate tribute to the late E. Gene Smith, the scholar, librarian and ex-Mormon who waged a 50-year struggle to save the endangered texts of Tibetan Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Review: "Digital Dharma"|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/digital-dharma-1117948104/|publisher=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== TBRC and Harvard ==
In summer 2012 TBRC relocated back to [[Harvard Square]] in Cambridge, MA, where the staff hand-picked by Smith continues its ongoing mission to preserve and provide access to Tibetan literature.

In cooperation with the Harvard University Open Access Project (HOAP), TBRC is currently working to make its entire library completely open access.&lt;ref name="Suber"/&gt; TBRC also coordinates internships with graduate students from [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the Department of South Asian Studies at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center moves US office to Cambridge, MA|url=http://shambhalasun.com/news/?p=34921|publisher=Buddhadharma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scanning and Text-Preservation in China ==
In 2007, Gene Smith bequeathed his personal collection of 12,000 Tibetan texts to the [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu|Chengdu, China]]. These texts are now housed in a newly constructed library that bears Smith's name, and which is now China's pre-eminent center for Tibetan literature.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

In October 2013, TBRC opened a scanning and text-preservation center at SWUN's E. Gene Smith Library, where four full-time archivists scan, catalog, and digitize Tibetan manuscripts, some centuries old, that are being brought to the library from around the region as news of its existence spreads. Some of these recent additions, now preserved and accessible in TBRC's digital archive, represent the only known versions of ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

==Buddhist Digital Resource Center==
TBRC announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond Tibetan, including Sanskrit, Pali and Chinese. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC) to [[Buddhist Digital Resource Center]] (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastiano del Piombo]]'s ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', transferred from panel to canvas in 1771.&lt;ref name=lazarus/&gt;]]
The practice of conserving an unstable [[panel painting|painting on panel]] by transferring it from its original decayed, worm-eaten, cracked or distorted wood support to canvas or a new panel has been practised since the eighteenth century. It has now been largely superseded by improved methods of  wood conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|page=189|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice evolved in [[Naples]] and [[Cremona]] in 1711–1725, and reached France by the middle of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|pages=268–9|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was especially widely practiced in the second half of the 19th century. Similar techniques are used to transfer [[fresco]]s. Oil paintings on [[canvas]] often [[Lining of paintings|receive additional support or are transferred to a new backing]].

==Methods==
The process is described by Henry Mogford  in his '' Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures''. Smooth sheets of paper were pasted over the painted surface of the panel, and a layer of [[muslin]] over that. The panel was then fixed, face down, to a table, and the wood planed away from the back  until it was "as thin as a plane may safely go", and the remainder scraped off with a sharp instrument such as a razor. The ground of the painting was then removed by solvents or scraping, until nothing remained but  a thin skin of colour,  pasted over with paper and held together by the muslin. A prepared canvas was then attached to the back of the paint layer, using the same method as was used for lining pictures. When the glue had dried, the  paper and muslin was removed by careful damping.&lt;ref name=mogford&gt;{{cite book|title= Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures|first=Henry|last=Mogford|edition=3rd|year=1851|pages=35–6|publisher= Winsor and Newton|location=London|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading workshop carrying out the process in Paris in the eighteenth century was that of Jean-Louis Hacquin (d. 1783), who transferred many works in the French royal collection.  Transfers from the workshop have sometimes been found to have a layer of pieces of silk, or of sheets of paper between the paint layer and the new canvas. The workshop  was continued after  Hacquin’s death by his son, François-Toussaint Hacquin (1756–1832),  who transferred many paintings  taken to France from Italy during the Napoleonic period.&lt;ref name=lazarus &gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Gallery Technical Bulletin|volume=30|year=2009|title=Sebastiano del Piombo's Raising of Lazarus: A History of Change|first1=Jill|last1= Dunkerton|first2=Helen|last2= Howard|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/pdf/dunkerton_howard2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method, used by Hacquin's contemporary,  Jean-Michel Picault, dissolved the ground layer chemically, apparently with  fumes of [[nitrous oxide]], allowing the panel to be removed intact from the paint.&lt;ref name=lazarus/&gt; A later restorer, Marie-Jacob Godefroid is recorded as having achieved similar results by the use of steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Getty Publications|title=Issues in the Conservation of Paintings|first1=David|last1= Bomford|first2=Mark|last2= Leonard,|year=2004|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywaDvCzGxpsC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq|isbn=978-0-89236-781-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A less dramatic "partial transfer" tended to be used in Germany and Austria, in which a thin layer of the original wood was retained, and glued onto a new panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|page=222|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17532">In [[computer architecture]], a '''transport triggered architecture''' ('''TTA''') is a kind of [[Processor_(computing)|processor]] design in which programs directly control the internal transport [[Bus (computing)|buses]] of a processor. Computation happens as a side effect of data transports: writing data into a ''triggering port'' of a [[functional unit]] triggers the functional unit to start a computation. This is similar to what happens in a [[systolic array]]. Due to its modular structure, TTA is an ideal processor template for [[application-specific instruction-set processor]]s (''ASIP'') with customized datapath but without the inflexibility and design cost of fixed function hardware accelerators.

Typically a transport triggered processor has multiple transport buses and multiple functional units connected to the buses, which provides opportunities for [[instruction level parallelism]]. The parallelism is statically defined by the programmer. In this respect (and obviously due to the large instruction word width), the TTA architecture resembles the [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) architecture. A TTA instruction word is composed of multiple slots, one slot per bus, and each slot determines the data transport that takes place on the corresponding bus. The fine-grained control allows some optimizations that are not possible in a conventional processor. For example, software can transfer data directly between functional units without using registers.

Transport triggering exposes some [[microarchitectural]] details that are normally hidden from programmers. This greatly simplifies the control logic of a processor, because many decisions normally done at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] are fixed at [[compile time]]. However, it also means that a binary compiled for one TTA processor will not run on another one without recompilation if there is even a small difference in the architecture between the two. The binary incompatibility problem, in addition to the complexity of implementing a full context switch, makes TTAs more suitable for [[embedded system]]s than for general purpose computing.

Of all the [[one instruction set computer]] architectures, the TTA architecture is one of the few that has had processors based on it built, and the only one that has processors based on it sold commercially.

== Benefits in comparison to VLIW architectures ==

TTAs can be seen as "exposed datapath" VLIW architectures. While VLIW is programmed using operations, TTA splits the operation execution to multiple ''move'' operations. The
low level programming model enables several benefits in comparison to the standard VLIW. For example, a TTA architecture can provide more parallelism with simpler register files than with VLIW. As the programmer is in control of the timing of the operand and result data transports, the complexity (the number of input and output ports) of the [[register file]] (RF) need not be scaled according to the worst case issue/completion scenario of the multiple parallel instructions.

An important unique software optimization enabled by the transport programming is called ''software bypassing''. In case of software bypassing, the programmer bypasses the register file write back by moving data directly to the next functional unit's operand ports. When this optimization is applied aggressively, the original move that transports the result to the register file can be eliminated completely, thus reducing both the register file port pressure and freeing a [[general purpose register]] for other temporary variables. The reduced [[register pressure]], in addition simplifying the required complexity of the RF hardware, can lead to significant [[CPU power dissipation#Reduction|CPU energy savings]], an important benefit especially in mobile embedded systems.&lt;ref name="GuzmaBypassing"&gt;V.

== Structure ==

TTA processors are built of independent ''function units'' and [[register file]]s, which are connected with ''transport buses'' and ''sockets''.

[[Image:Transport Triggered Architecture.png|thumb|Parts of transport triggered architecture]]

=== Function unit ===
Each function unit implements one or more [[Operator (programming)|operations]], which implement functionality ranging from a simple addition of integers to a complex and arbitrary user-defined application-specific computation. Operands for operations are transferred through function unit ''ports''.

Each function unit may have an independent [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]. In case a function unit is [[Instruction pipeline|fully pipelined]], a new operation that takes multiple [[clock cycle]]s to finish can be started in every clock cycle. On the other hand, a pipeline can be such that it does not always accept new operation start requests while an old one is still executing.

[[Computer memory|Data memory]] access and communication to outside of the processor is handled by using special function units. Function units that implement memory accessing operations and connect to a memory module are often called [[load–store unit (computing)|load/store units]].

=== Control unit ===
{{main article | control unit }}
''Control unit'' is a special case of function units which controls execution 
of programs. Control unit has access to the instruction memory in order to fetch the instructions to be executed. In order to allow the executed programs to transfer  the execution (jump) to an arbitrary position in the executed program, control unit provides control flow operations. A control unit usually has an [[instruction pipeline]], which consists of stages for fetching, decoding and executing program instructions.

=== Register files ===
{{main article | register file }}
Register files contain [[general purpose register]]s, which are used to store variables in programs. Like function units, also register files have input and output ports. The number of read and write ports, that is, the capability of being able to read and write multiple registers in a same clock cycle, can vary in each register file.

=== Transport buses and sockets ===
[[Interconnect architecture]] consists of [[Computer bus|transport buses]] which are connected to function unit ports by means of ''sockets''. Due to expense of connectivity, it is usual to reduce the number of connections between units (function units and register files). A TTA is said to be ''fully connected'' in case there is a path from each unit output port to every unit's input ports.

Sockets provide means for programming TTA processors by allowing to select which bus-to-port connections of the socket are enabled at any time instant. Thus, data transports taking place in a clock cycle can be programmed by defining the source and destination socket/port connection to be enabled for each bus.

=== Conditional execution ===

Some TTA implementations support [[addressing mode#Conditional execution|conditional execution]].

[[Conditional execution]] is implemented with the aid of ''guards''. Each data transport can be conditionalized by a guard, which is connected to a register (often a 1-bit [[conditional register]]) and to a bus. In case the value of the guarded register evaluates to false (zero), the data transport programmed for the bus the guard is connected to is ''squashed'', that is, not written to its destination. ''Unconditional'' data transports are not connected to any guard and are always executed.

=== Branches ===

All processors, including TTA processors, include [[control flow]] instructions that alter the program counter, which are used to implement [[subroutine]]s, [[if-then-else]], [[for-loop]], etc.
The assembly language for TTA processors typically includes control flow instructions such as unconditional branches (JUMP), conditional relative branches (BNZ), subroutine call (CALL), conditional return (RETNZ), etc. that look the same as the corresponding assembly language instructions for other processors.

Like all other operations on a TTA machine, these instructions are implemented as "move" instructions to a special function unit.

TTA implementations that support conditional execution, such as the sTTAck and the first MOVE prototype, can implement most of these control flow instructions as a conditional move to the program counter.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef99/chapyzhenka99.pdf "sTTAck: Stack Transport Triggered Architecture"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

TTA implementations that only support unconditional data transports, such as the MAXQ, typically have a special function unit tightly connected to the program counter that responds to a variety of destination addresses.
Each such address, when used as the destination of a "move", has a different effect on the program counter—each "relative branch &amp;lt;condition&amp;gt;" instruction has a different destination address for each condition; and other destination addresses are used CALL, RETNZ, etc.

== Programming ==

In more traditional processor architectures, a processor is usually programmed by defining the executed operations and their operands. For example, an addition instruction in a RISC architecture could look like the following.
&lt;pre&gt;
add r3, r1, r2
&lt;/pre&gt;

This example operation adds the values of general-purpose registers r1 and r2 and stores the result in
register r3. Coarsely, the execution of the instruction in the processor probably results in translating the instruction to control signals which control the interconnection network connections and function units. The interconnection network is used to transfer the current values of registers r1 and r2 to the function unit that is capable of executing the add operation, often called ALU as in Arithmetic-Logic Unit. Finally, a control signal selects and triggers the addition operation in ALU, of which result is transferred back to the register r3.

TTA programs do not define the operations, but only the data transports needed to write and read the operand values. Operation itself is triggered by writing data to a ''triggering operand'' of an operation. Thus, an operation is executed as a side effect of the triggering data transport. Therefore, executing an addition operation in TTA requires three data transport definitions, also called ''moves''. A move defines endpoints for a data transport taking place in a transport bus. For instance, a move can state that 
a data transport from function unit F, port 1, to register file R, register index 2, should take place in bus B1. In case there 
are multiple buses in the target processor, each bus can be utilized in parallel in the same clock cycle. Thus, it is possible to 
exploit data transport level parallelism by scheduling several data transports in the same instruction.

An addition operation can be executed in a TTA processor as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
r1 -&gt; ALU.operand1
r2 -&gt; ALU.add.trigger
ALU.result -&gt; r3
&lt;/pre&gt;

The second move, a write to the second operand of the function unit called ALU, triggers the addition operation.
This makes the result of addition available in the output port 'result' after the execution latency of the 'add'.

The ports associated with the ALU may act as an [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]], allowing creation of [[macro instruction]]s that [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstract away]] the underlying TTA:
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
lda r1    ; "load ALU": move value to ALU operand 1
add r2    ; add: move value to add trigger
sta r3    ; "store ALU": move value from ALU result
&lt;/source&gt;

== Programmer visible operation latency ==

The leading philosophy of TTAs is to move complexity from hardware to software. Due to this, several additional hazards are introduced to the programmer. One of them is [[delay slot]]s, the programmer visible operation latency of the function units. Timing is completely the responsibility of the programmer. The programmer has to schedule the instructions such that the result is neither read too early nor too late. There is no hardware detection to lock up the processor in case a result is read too early. Consider, for example, an architecture that has an operation ''add'' with latency of 1, and operation ''mul'' with latency of 3. When triggering the ''add'' operation, it is possible to read the result in the next instruction (next clock cycle), but in case of ''mul'', one has to wait for two instructions before the result can be read. The result is ready for the 3rd instruction after the triggering instruction.

Reading a result too early results in reading the result of a previously triggered operation, or in case 
no operation was triggered previously in the function unit, the read value is undefined. On the other hand, 
result must be read early enough to make sure the next operation result does not overwrite the yet unread
result in the output port.

Due to the abundance of programmer-visible processor context which practically includes, in addition to
register file contents, also function unit pipeline register contents and/or function unit 
input and output ports, context saves required for external interrupt support can become complex and expensive to implement in a TTA processor. Therefore, interrupts are usually not supported by TTA processors, but their 
task is delegated to an external hardware (e.g., an I/O processor) or their need is avoided by using 
an alternative synchronization/communication mechanism such as polling.

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005). [http://web.missouri.edu/~psycorie/JCP05%5Bfinal%5D05.pdf The motivation to control and the origin of mind: Exploring the life-mind joint point in the tree of knowledge.] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61,'' 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

==Reputation==
The School of Information Sciences' MS/LIS degree has been ranked as the top library and information science (LIS) graduate program in the country by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings | title=Best Library and Information Studies Programs, Graduate Schools | accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Research and Markets' 2008-2009 Survey of Academic Libraries, Illinois was ranked the number one library and information science program in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.uiuc.edu/news/08/0804gslis.html | date=2008-08-04 | title=New Survey Ranks U of I iSchool No. 1 in U.S., Canada | publisher=News Bureau at the University of Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the school is also ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report as first in services for children and youth, first in digital libraries, and third in school media library in comparison to other U.S. and Canada library and information science schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/children-youth-service-rankings | title=Best Services for Children and Youth Programs | accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/digital-librarianship-rankings | title=Best Digital Librarianship Programs | accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-media-rankings | title=Best School Library Media Programs | accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program has its roots in the Library Science Program at the Armour Institute of Chicago created in September 1893 as part of the strong cultural movement following the [[Industrial Revolution]] to professionally educate men and women for the upcoming twentieth century and for the technical world.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The public library had come to be seen by most as a "university of the people," and those who were to become the "best librarians" were those formally educated in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking a director, Gunsaulus, the president of the Institute, asked Melvil Dewey to recommend the best person for the job. Dewey recommended [[Katharine Sharp]], who was finishing up her library science degree program in Dewey's school in Albany, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, the school became the only library science program in the Midwest and the fourth in the United States.

Sharp, in turn, became the library school: "Her enthusiasm, her drive, and her unswerving dedication were the determining factors for the school during its formative years in Chicago as well as the following ten years when she directed the Illinois State Library School on the Urbana-Champaign campus." &lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; The school in Chicago, operating off of a technical institute model, began taking on a university structure under Sharp's leadership. The Armour facility did not provide enough collection or classroom space that was needed, and finances were becoming tight. The University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin were interested in the program, and both universities offered to accept Sharp's program. Sharp chose the University of Illinois, and the program moved to Urbana.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial location for the library science program was in [[Altgeld Hall]] where it remained until 1926. It then moved to the Main Library for the next fifty three years until 1979. The program then relocated to David Kinley Hall until 1993. An additional relocation went underway when the University purchased property from [[Acacia Fraternity]]'s Illinois Heth chapter and moved the school to its current location at Fifth and Daniel Streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rushacacia.com/History&lt;/ref&gt;

The school officially changed its name from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) to the School of Information Sciences in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://ischool.illinois.edu/articles/2015/10/faculty-vote-favor-name-change-proposal&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The school is located on the corner of Fifth and Daniel streets in Champaign, Illinois. It is situated next to the Department of Speech and Hearing Science and across the street from the Department of Psychology. The building was formerly the location of the [[Acacia Fraternity]] and still has functional showers for both men and women along with three kitchens. A computer lab, known as the Learning Resource Lab (LRL), is located in the basement and available for student use 24/7 with card access. Other areas, such as the second floor lounge and the doctoral student area, serve as study spots for students. Wireless Internet access is also available in all public areas, and technology support is provided by the department's Help Desk on the second floor. The Help Desk is staffed by current iSchool master's students.

The building is also in close proximity to many campus libraries. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, one of three campuses of the University of Illinois system, has over 40 libraries; their combined holdings are among the largest in the United States and the world. One such library, The Center for Children's Books, which houses more than 16,000 youth trade books, is located on the bottom floor of the iSchool building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ccb.lis.illinois.edu/aboutus.html | date=2014-11-27 | title=Center for Children's Books - About Us | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204173206/http://ccb.lis.illinois.edu/aboutus.html | archivedate=2014-12-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.
