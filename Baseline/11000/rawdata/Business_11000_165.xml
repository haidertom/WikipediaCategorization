      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12181">The [[accounting profession]] in [[Luxembourg]] is structured around [[Ordre des Experts-Comptables]] (OEC) which serves as the main accounting body in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ordre des Experts-Comptables (OEC): Home|url = http://oec.lu/|website = oec.lu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourg accounting standards are inspired from neighbouring France and Belgium. Similar to France, Luxembourg has set up a Commissions des Normes Comptables (CNC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mj.public.lu/actualites/2013/10/Octavie_Modert_signe_les_statuts_du_GIE/d130320030__v-DB_2013-10-01_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as an advisor to the Ministry for Justice in respect of accounting related matters, e.g. waivers for presenting [[Consolidated financial statement|consolidated accounts]].

==Organisation==

Access to the accounting profession is strictly regulated in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountants|url = http://www.luxembourgforfinance.com/why-luxembourg/actors/ancillary-supporting-services/accountants|website = Luxembourg for finance|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone wishing to establish themselves as a chartered accountant in Luxembourg must hold a degree from the [[University of Luxembourg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Formation complémentaire des candidats réviseurs d'entreprises et experts-comptables|url = http://wwwen.uni.lu/formations/fdef/formation_complementaire_des_candidats_reviseurs_d_entreprises_et_experts_comptables|website = University of Luxembourg|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and get an authorisation to set up their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ordre des Experts-Comptables (OEC): Conditions d'octroi de l’autorisation d'établissement|url = http://oec.lu/index.php?id=31|website = oec.lu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree (OEC) consists of 5 exams (Tax Law, Accounting, Ethics, Labour Law, and Corporate Law) as well as a three-year traineeship in a related position, including at least one year with a qualified employer. Recognition of other national or international qualifications is possible under the mutual recognition procedure allowed by the [[European Union]] under the [[Bologna Process]]. Professional qualifications leading to recognition as a qualified [[auditor]] (Réviseur d'Entreprises Agréé) are different, although they have exams in common with the OEC degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home|url = http://ire.lu/fr/home/|website = Institut des réviseurs d’entreprises (IRE)|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both professional qualifications feature exercises and questions in French while candidates are allowed to reply in either French, German or English. OEC is under the direct stewardship of the Ministry of the Economy.

==Accounting standards==

Applicable accounting standards in Luxembourg are interchangeably referred to as either "Luxembourg GAAP" (i.e. [[Generally accepted accounting principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]]) or "Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements" (as often disclosed in the notes to the financial statements). Lux GAAP fall under the Law of 19 December 2002 as amended, sometimes referred to as "the Accounting Law". This law lays out specific accounting principles for all the main financial statement items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Modernisation of the Luxembourg Accounting Law {{!}} Wildgen|url = http://www.wildgen.lu/publications/articles/modernisation-luxembourg-accounting-law|website = www.wildgen.lu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lux GAAP are notable for the many options they afford, especially in terms of asset recognition. For instance, financial assets may be recognised at either 1) acquisition or production cost, 2) fair value (as allowed under the Law of 10 December 2010 which amended the 2002 Law), 3) the lower of cost or market value, depending on financial statement line items. Since theLaw of 30 July 2013 was passed, profits arising from revaluation of assets recognised at fair value may not be distributed as dividends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/2013/0177/a177.pdf|title=Mémorial A n° 177 de 2013 - Legilux|website=www.legilux.public.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law also defines the accounting framework applicable under Lux GAAP, especially the principles relevant to the preparation of financial statements, especially the prudence principle under which unrealised gains are not recognised except where fair value is applicable, in stark contrast to rules under [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS).

Lawmakers in Luxembourg are especially keen on using doctrine from neighbouring France and Belgium whenever legal and regulatory requirements are unclear. International Financial Reporting Standards are also a major source of inspiration. For instance, research and development costs used not to have clear recognition principles, but it has been admitted that the usual criteria under IAS 38 could be used as guidelines for recognising intangible assets under Lux GAAP as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/lu/en/home/insights.html|title=Insights - KPMG - LU|date=8 February 2018|website=KPMG}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS have also been allowed for statutory accounts in Luxembourg, although this requires an agreement from the Luxembourg Ministry for Justice except for credit institutions, insurance companies and similar entitieswho may choose between Lux GAAP and IFRS (as adopted by the European Union) for their separate or consolidated accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Luxembourg|url = http://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/europe/luxembourg|website = www.iasplus.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with EU Regulation 1606/2002/EC, Luxembourg entities which issue listed securities on any European Union regulated market must present their consolidated accounts under [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS as adopted by the European Union]] for financial years as from 1 January 2005.

Annual accounts presented under Lux GAAP must be filed with the Luxembourg Trade Register, also known as Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés (RCS), usually 7 months after year-end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Legilux - Mémorial C|url = http://www.legilux.public.lu/entr/index.php|website = www.legilux.public.lu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual accounts presented under Lux GAAP must consist of at least a balance sheet, statement of profit and loss, and notes. Cash-flow statements are not presented under Lux GAAP in contrast to IFRS. Disclosures depend on three criteria according to which companies are classified as either "big", "medium" or "small", i.e. net turnover, balance sheet total and number of full-time employees. The latest criteria thresholds are as follows: small companies have less than €8.8 million in net turnover, less than €4.4 million in balance sheet total and less than 50 full-time employees while big conmpanies have over €35 million in net turnover, more than €17.5 million in balance sheet total and over 250 full-time employees. Two out of those three criteria must be met for at least two consecutive years in order for the size category to apply.

For certain types of companies, different recognition criteria may apply, for instance, the option to recognise financial assets at either acquisition cost or fair value is unaivalable to investment funds which must necessarily use fair value, as laid out by the Law of 17 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arendt.com/publications/documents/lawsregulations/loi%20opc%2017%20december%202010%20english%20version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tax rules significantly affect accounting practice in Luxembourg, for instance, some [[Financial instrument|instruments]] may qualify as debt instruments under Lux GAAP while they are recognised as [[Equity (finance)|equity]] instruments above, for instance Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs) which consist of [[Preferred stock|preference shares]] which pay an interest to the investor but are accounted for as debt while they would typically meet the recognition criteria as an equity instrument under IAS 32. Generally speaking, substance over form has been made a non-mandatory accounting principle with the Law of 30 July 2013, and the legal substance of contracts usually takes precedence under Lux GAAP as opposed to economic substance under IFRS, similar to accounting principles in France. Similarly, legal rules applicable to companies in Luxembourg also affect accounting, especially the Law of 10 August 1915 as amended, which constitutes the main law for commercial companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Standard chart of accounts - Entreprises // Luxembourg|url = http://www.guichet.public.lu/entreprises/en/gestion-juridique-comptabilite/comptable/enregistrement/plan-comptable/index.html|website = www.guichet.public.lu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, article 49 of the 1915 Law contains strict rules concerning the purchase of own shares, which translate into a specific accounting treatment whereby the own shares must be neutralised{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} and allocated to a specific reserve.

A standard chart of account (SCA) was enacted as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guichet.public.lu/entreprises/en/gestion-juridique-comptabilite/comptable/enregistrement/plan-comptable/index.html|title=Standard chart of accounts - Entreprises // Luxembourg|website=www.guichet.public.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It applies mostly to commercial companies, and explicitly excludes entities which are supervised by the two main Luxembourg regulators, the Commission de Supervision du Secteur Financier (CSSF) and the Commissariat aux Assurances (CAA), which are chiefly responsible for overseeing investment funds, banks, insurance companies and similar entities. All entities subject to SCA requirements must adopt the same account numbers for each financial statement element as those laid out by the SCA, and present and file accounts under a specific format referred to as electronic Centrale des Données Financières also known as "eCDF". Again, this stands in contrast to the practice in English-speaking countries where standard charts of accounts usually are specific to each company, and where professional accounting bodies are responsible for defining practical rules and the applicable accounting doctrine rather than standardisation falling to governmental bodies or lawmakers as is the case in most of Continental Europe.

==Accounting firms in Luxembourg==
All [[Big Four accounting firms]] have a strong presence in Luxembourg, disproportionately to the number of inhabitants in the country. This is especially due to the fund industry being so developed in Luxembourg with over €3.5 trillion in assets under management as at 31 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Luxembourg {{!}} Alfi|url = http://www.alfi.lu/statistics-figures/luxembourg|website = www.alfi.lu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable contributors to the Luxembourg national economy are banks (approximately 140 currently operating in the country), insurance companies as well as private equity companies on top of the traditional commercial companies. Currently, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] is the top Big Four company in Luxembourg in terms of number of employees (about 2,500) and net turnover (€315 million) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2014 results|url = https://www.pwc.lu/en/annual-review/2014/results.jhtml|website = PwC|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deloitte]], [[KPMG]] and [[Ernst &amp; Young]] all have a significant presence in Luxembourg. Smaller companies are also present, such as [[Mazars]], [[Grant Thornton International|Grant Thornton]] and [[BDO International|BDO]]. On top of the audit industry, there are a number of service providers and trust companies notably responsible for [[Domicile (law)|domiciliation]] and accounting services, the most prominent of which include [[Intertrust Group|Intertrust]], [[TMF Group|TMF]], [[Alter Domus]] and [[Citco]].

'''Aldo Gucci'''  (26 May 1905 – 19 January 1990) was the chairman of [[Gucci|Gucci Shops Inc.]] from 1953 to 1986.  He was the eldest son of [[Guccio Gucci]], who founded the company bearing his name in 1921.

== Early life ==
Aldo Gucci was born in Florence into a Tuscan family dating back to the thirteenth century in the nearby town of San Miniato.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EExuyvAOiNgC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=gucci+san+miniato#v=onepage&amp;q=gucci%20san%20miniato&amp;f=false | title = The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed | isbn = 9780062222671 | author1 = Forden | first1 = Sara G | date = 8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his formative years he developed an interest in equestrianism and botany, which would later find its outlet in product design and a passion for gardening.  At just sixteen he began part-time work in his father's first shop in via della Vigna Nuova in Florence.

== Career ==
From the age of 20, Aldo began work full-time at Gucci. He went on to open the first shop outside his native city in Rome in 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gucci.com/ch/worldofgucci/articles/rome-flagship |title=via condotti store, rome |publisher=Gucci |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after took over the reins of the company upon his father's death in 1953. Gucci became an overnight status symbol when the bamboo handbag was featured on Ingrid Bergman's arm in Roberto Rossellini's 1954 film "Viaggio in Italia".  The GG insignia became an instant favorite of Hollywood celebrities and European royalty.
When Aldo opened in New York in 1953, he planted the "Made in Italy" flag on American soil for the first time.  President John F Kennedy heralded him as the first Italian Ambassador to fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article_print.php?article=3042&amp;show_images=1 |title=The American &amp;#124; In Italia: At Large: History 102: Bloodied luxury |publisher=Theamericanmag.com |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was awarded an honorary degree by the City University of New York in recognition of his philanthropic activity, described as the Michelangelo of Merchandising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaiter |first=Dorothy J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/03/nyregion/at-3-commencements-recognition-and-advice-209299.html |title=AT 3 COMMENCEMENTS, RECOGNITION AND ADVICE |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=3 June 1983 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He went on to open shops in Chicago, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills, before expanding to Tokyo, Hong Kong and in cities around the world through a global franchising network.  For over thirty years he was dedicated to the expansion of Gucci, developing the company into a vertically integrated business with its own tanneries, manufacturing and retail premises. In 1986 he was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for tax evasion in New York. He was 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engelberg |first=Stephen |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/taxation/index.html?offset=750&amp;s=closest&amp;field=des&amp;match=exact&amp;query=TAX%20EVASION&amp; |title=Taxes – News – Times Topics – The New York Times – Narrowed by 'TAX EVASION' |publisher=Travel2.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did his time at the [[Federal Prison Camp, Eglin|Federal Prison Camp]] at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. In 1987, after 66 years as a family-owned business, Gucci was sold to [[Investcorp]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Investcorp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo Gucci died at the age of 84 of prostate cancer, in January 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/21/obituaries/aldo-gucci-84-expanded-fashion-house-in-us.html|title=Aldo Gucci, 84; Expanded Fashion House in U.S.|last=Reuters|date=1990|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
Aldo was the eldest of five children born to Guccio and Aida Calvelli Gucci. He had three brothers – Vasco, Rodolfo and Enzo (who died aged nine), and a sister – Grimalda.  He also had an adopted brother, Ugo, from his mother's previous relationship.  Aldo had three sons – Giorgio, Paolo and Roberto (with Olwen Price), and a daughter – Patricia (with Bruna Palombo, whom he married in Palm Springs, California in 1987), all of whom worked in the family business until its sale in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everett |first=Victoria |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083026,00.html |title=Move Over, Dallas; Behind the Glittering Facade, a Family Feud Rocks the House of Gucci |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, Hale and such other notable [[Waterford]] footballers as [[Davy Walsh]], [[Paddy Coad]], [[Peter Thomas (footballer born 1944)|Peter Thomas]], [[Jim Beglin]] and [[John O'Shea]] were honoured by the Waterford City Council and presented with a [[Waterford Crystal]] vase.

==Playing career==

===Waterford===
Hale spent much of his playing and coaching career at [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]]. His father, three brothers and two uncles had all played for the club in the 1930s. In 1930 the trio even formed an all-Hale half-back line in a league game at home to [[Bohemians F.C.|Bohemians]]. At the age of 17 Hale junior along with [[Peter Fitzgerald (footballer)]] made a scoring [[League of Ireland]] debut at Kilcohan Park on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1957 in a 3–1 win over Bohemians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1957/0318/Pg004.html#Ar00412:2C67E82EA7FD31969435F6AA2D57B131B7C62F27E83027FD3037E83397FD2FD85834186D]&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Waterford in 1960 but after seven seasons in the [[Football League|English League]], he returned in 1966. Then together with [[Johnny Matthews]], he became a central figure in a Waterford team that dominated the [[League of Ireland]]. In 1971–72 Hale was player-manager of the side when they beat [[Cork Hibernians F.C.|Cork Hibernians]] in dramatic circumstances at [[Flower Lodge]] to claim his fifth league title in six seasons. In both 1971–72 and 1972–73 he also finished as joint top goalscorer in the league, scoring 22 and 20 goals respectively.&lt;ref name=rsssf/&gt; He is also the 7th highest [[League of Ireland]] goalscorer of all time with 153 league goals.&lt;ref name=rsssf&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html  Top goalscorers in League of Ireland – RSSSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093820/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html |date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a benefit game in August 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1971/0805/Pg004.html  www.irishtimes.com (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored twice against [[AC Omonia]] in the [[1972–73 European Cup]].

===Aston Villa===
In June 1960, aged 19, Hale was sold by [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of £4,500. However, Hale failed to establish himself in the Villa first team and went on to make just 7 first team appearances, scoring 2 goals. Despite this Hale won his first international cap for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] while at Villa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/OnThisDay/0,,10265~855241,00.html  Aston Villa site] {{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doncaster Rovers===
Hale signed for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in the summer of 1962 and made his debut for the club on 18 August in a 2–0 defeat to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in the [[Football League Fourth Division]]. He scored four goals in a single game as he helped Rovers to a record league win when they beat [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. In three seasons with Rovers, Hale made 119 league appearances and scored 42 goals. He also made 7 appearances for Rovers in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and 9 in the [[FA Cup]], scoring 2 further goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doncasterrovers.co.uk/players/GtoJ/Hale,Alfie.htm|title=Alfie Hale: inside forward 1962–1965|publisher=Doncasterrovers.co.uk|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland international===
Between 1962 and 1973, Hale made 14 appearances and scored 2 goals for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]]. He made his senior international debut on 8 April 1962 in a 3–2 home defeat against [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Hale went on to score twice for the Republic of Ireland, both goals coming in 1968, against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and then Austria. He made his last appearance for the Republic of Ireland on 21 October 1973 as a substitute in a 1–0 home win against Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/player.php?id=328|title=Alfie Hale|work=International Mens Statistics|publisher=Soccerscene.ie|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
As a manager Hale would return to [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] for two further spells. During the first of these, between 1982 until 1986, he guided the club to victory in the [[League of Ireland Cup]] in 1985 and to the [[FAI Cup]] final in 1986. He returned to manage the club again between 1991 and 1993 and helped them achieve promotion from the [[League of Ireland First Division|First Division]] in 1992. In 2005, he briefly returned to Waterford United once again, this time acting as special advisor.

Aside from Waterford, Hale has also coached several other teams in the League of Ireland. He was appointed player/manager of [[Thurles Town F.C.|Thurles Town]] in May 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1981/0521/Pg003.html#Ar00313:07870E0A972F08776D0A578011F80113A81406276D081780 Irish Times (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt; where he made history by becoming the League of Ireland's oldest ever goalscorer, and also the only player to score in four different League of Ireland decades. As manager of [[Cobh Ramblers F.C.|Cobh Ramblers]], Hale gave [[Roy Keane]] his debut in 1990. Between 1995 and 1999 he was manager of [[Kilkenny City A.F.C.|Kilkenny City]] and in 1997, with a team which included the likes of his son Richie, Brendan Rea, Paul Cashin and Pascal Keane, he guided them to the First Division title. After leaving Kilkenny, Hale remained active in junior football working with Waterford Crystal F.C. and Tramore F.C, winning the first league in 50 years with Tramore in 2000–01.

==Businessman==
At the same time as managing various [[League of Ireland]] clubs, Hale also established himself as a prominent businessman in the [[Waterford]] area. In 1978, he opened a sports shop, currently trading under the name ''Alfie Hale's [[Intersport]]'' and located at Arundal Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfiehale.com/about.htm Alfie Hale's Intersport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110225/http://www.alfiehale.com/about.htm |date= 7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owns a chain of pubs including ''Alfie Hale's Bar'' in Ballybricken&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratemypub.ie/pub.php?pubid=4931 Alfie Hale's Bar]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Alfie Hale's Sports Bar'' on Lombard Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratemypub.ie/editpub.php?pubid=4352 Alfie Hale's Sports Bar]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, he settled with the [[Revenue Commissioners]] for over €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/former-ireland-player-to-pay-revenue-over-8364100000-1561089.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[2012 League of Ireland]] season Hale is tenth in the all-time League of Ireland goalscoring list with 153 league goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093820/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angelo Dalle Molle''' (4 November 1908 – 2001) was an Italian businessman and [[Utopian]] [[philanthropist]]. In 1952 he invented and patented [[Cynar]], a bitter [[aperitivo]] based on [[artichoke]] leaves, which became famous partly due to advertisements with [[Ernesto Calindri]] and the slogan "{{lang|it|contro il logorio della vita moderna}}", "against the stress of modern life". 

==Business life==

Dalle Molle was born in [[Mestre]], on the lagoon of [[Venice]], on 4 November 1908. In 1952 he invented and patented Cynar, a bitter aperitivo/[[digestivo]] based on artichoke leaves, which quickly became popular through the slogan "{{lang|it|contro il logorio della vita moderna}}", "against the stress of modern life", and the appearances on ''[[Carosello]]'' of Ernesto Calindri drinking it in the middle of the [[Milan]] traffic. His company later acquired the Crodo mineral water company which made the non-alcoholic bitter aperitivo [[Crodino]]. In 1976 he sold his company to the Dutch group [[Lucas Bols|Bols]] (though he retained the rights to the slogan); he then used the proceeds of the sale to buy a controlling share-holding.&lt;ref name=scala/&gt; He also bought the [[Villa Barberigo]] at [[Stra]],&lt;ref name=nuova/&gt; on the [[Brenta canal]], and became a patron of the arts and of social and scientific research.

==Patronage and projects==

Dalle Molle believed that [[information technology]] could or should improve the quality of life, and established the [[Lang-fr|{{noitalic|Fondation Dalle Molle pour la qualité de la vie}}]], or Dalle Molle Foundation for the Quality of Life, in 1971 to promote research into ways in which it might do so, including [[artificial intelligence]]. Through it he set up four [[research institutes]] in Switzerland.
 
===Research institutes===

The [[Dalle Molle Institute for Semantic and Cognitive Studies]] ({{lang-it|{{noitalic|Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi Semantici e Cognitivi}}}}, ISSCO) was established in [[Lugano]] in 1972 to conduct research into the application of artificial intelligence to [[linguistics]] and [[automated translation]]. It became part of the faculty of translation and interpreting of the [[University of Geneva]] in 1976. 

In 1988 he started the [[Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research]] ({{lang-it|{{noitalic|Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza Artificiale}}}}, IDSIA), also in Lugano, to undertake research into [[machine learning]] and adaptation. It became a public research institute in 2000, and is affiliated with the [[Scuola universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana]] (SUPSI) and the [[Università della Svizzera italiana]] in Lugano.

The [[Idiap Research Institute|Istituto Dalle Molle di Intelligenza Artificiale Percettiva]] (IDIAP) was set up in [[Martigny]] in the [[Canton du Valais]] in 1991, the twentieth anniversary of the Fondation Dalle Molle, in collaboration with the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL) and local, cantonal and federal government bodies. Its purpose was to research applications of artificial intelligence to human perception. It became independent of the Fondation in 1996, and is now called the Idiap Research Institute.&lt;ref name=fond3/&gt;

Dalle Molle also founded the Centro Studi della Barbariga, which among other projects designed a series of [[electric vehicle]]s, including cars, a taxi, a van and an ambulance. About 200 of them were built, in a small [[manufactory]] in the gardens of the villa.&lt;ref name=automoto/&gt; Seven cars are now in the collection of the [[Museo dell'automobile Bonfanti-Vimar]] at [[Romano d'Ezzelino]], in the [[province of Vicenza]], in the [[Veneto]].&lt;ref name=museo/&gt;

==Personal life==

Dalle Molle had relationships and children with several women. He was married only twice. His first wife was either Pierina Altieri&lt;ref name=scala/&gt; or Edes Zago,&lt;ref name=corriere/&gt; and ended with a Papal annulment;&lt;ref name=corriere/&gt; he adopted her son.&lt;ref name=scala/&gt; He had five other children with two other women. At the age of 90 he married Eleonora Bötner, who was 40 years younger, and to whom on his death in 2001 he left about €32 million.&lt;ref name=corriere/&gt;

'''Arthur Goodhart Altschul''' (6 April 1920 – 17 March 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]][http://ssdi.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi Rootsweb.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820044629/http://ssdi.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American banker and a [[Goldman Sachs]] Group partner,&lt;ref name=NYTDeathsAltschul&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/classified/paid-notice-deaths-altschul-arthur-goodhart.html Paid Notice: Deaths: Altschul, Arthur Goodhart], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; and executive at his private [[family office]], Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father.&lt;ref name=overbrook/&gt;

==Early life==
Altschul was born in 1920 in [[Manhattan]] to Helen Lehman Goodhart (maternal granddaughter of [[Mayer Lehman]], one of the three founding brothers of Lehman brothers) and [[Frank Altschul]], an investment banker who was a senior partner at [[Lazard Frères]] until 1945 and chairman of General Investors Corporation until he retired in 1961.

He graduated from [[Deerfield Academy]] in Massachusetts and in 1943 from [[Yale College]].

==Career==
He served in the [[USMC|Marines]] from 1943 through 1945 and was a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the late 1940s.

As he had family connections to the [[Lehman family]], he worked as an analyst with [[Lehman Brothers]] before joining [[General American Investors Company]] (a closed-end investment concern in which his family has a substantial interest) and then [[Goldman Sachs]] where he served as a general partner from 1959 to 1977 and a limited partner from 1977 to 1999. He was also chairman of General American Investors from 1961 to 1995.&lt;ref name=NYTBankerCollector&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/20/nyregion/arthur-g-altschul-81-banker-art-collector-and-philanthropist.html|work=The New York Times|title= "Arthur G. Altschul, 81, Banker, Art Collector and Philanthropist"|author=Eric Pace|date= March 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He led the private [[family office]], Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. In 2002, the office opened to provides asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Over the years, Overbrook’s leadership passed to him, and then to the third generation, his son, Arthur Goodhart Altschul, Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook's Chairman.&lt;ref name=overbrook&gt;[https://www.overbrook.com/default.asp?P=1020720&amp;S=1020722 Our Team] overbrook.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Altschul was on the Board of Trustees of many museums and philanthropic organisations, including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[United Jewish Communities|United Jewish Appeal]], the [[Overbrook Foundation]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[The American Assembly]],&lt;ref name=NYTDeathsAltschul /&gt; and the International Foundation for Art Research.

[[Image:Salsola sativa Ypey96.jpg|thumb|right|''Halogeton sativus'' is one of the plants from which '''barilla''' was made. The species was formerly classified as ''Salsola sativa''. Engraving published 1813 (Adolphus Ypey).]]
'''''Barilla''''' refers to several species of salt-tolerant ([[halophyte]]) plants that, until the 19th Century, were the primary source of [[soda ash]] and hence of [[sodium carbonate]]. The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to the soda ash obtained from plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;
Definitions of "barilla" in ''The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1989). Definitions retrieved from the [http://www.oed.com online edition] on December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is an anglicization of the Spanish word [[:es:barrilla|''barrilla'']] for [[saltwort]] plants (a particular category of halophytes).

A very early reference indicating the value placed upon soda ash in [[Catalonia]] has been given by Glick, who notes that "In 1189 the [[Poblet Monastery|monastery of Poblet]] granted to the glassblower Guillem the right to gather [[glasswort]] in return for tithe and two hundred pounds of sheet glass paid annually (The site of these glassworks, at Narola, was excavated in 1935.)."&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1979). [https://www.webcitation.org/5W0JzxVnN?url=http://libro.uca.edu/ics/ics7.htm ''Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages: Comparative Perspectives on Social and Cultural Formation''] (Princeton University Press, Princeton), ch. 7. Archived at WebCite from [https://archive.is/20120710141038/http://libro.uca.edu/ics/emspain.htm this original URL] on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th Century, Spain's barilla industry was exporting large quantities of soda ash of exceptional purity; the product was refined from the ashes of barilla plants that were specifically cultivated for this purpose. Presumably the word "barilla" entered English and other languages as a consequence of this export trade. The main Spanish barilla species included (i) ''[[Salsola soda]]'' (the common English term '''barilla plant''' for ''Salsola soda'' reflects this usage), (ii) ''[[Salsola kali]]'', and (iii) ''[[Halogeton]] sativus'' (formerly ''Salsola sativa'').&lt;ref&gt;

''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira described the main species used to make barilla in different places. Thus "[[Canary Islands|Canary]] barilla is procured from ''Salsola Kali''," "[[Alicante (province)|Alicant]] barilla is obtained from ''Salsola sativa'', ''Chenopodium setigerum'', and other species," and "Of the French barillas, two only deserve notice; namely, that of [[Narbonne]], obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and which yields 14-15%, ..." Online version at [https://books.google.com/books?id=KyIb0tE9COAC books.google.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly recently, Pérez&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt; has concluded that the most prominent species was likely ''Halogeton sativus''; earlier authors have tended to favor ''Salsola soda''.

The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the [[saltwort]]s grown in Spain, but also [[glasswort]]s, [[mangrove]]s, and [[kelp|seaweed]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Juliet F. (1978). "The Nineteenth-Century Soap Industry and its Exploitation of Intertidal Vegetation in Eastern Australia ," ''The [[Australian Geographer]], Vol. 14'', pp. 38&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of plant-derived soda ash are impure [[alkali]] substances that contain widely varying amounts of [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), some additional [[potassium carbonate]] (also an alkali), and a predominance of non-alkali impurities.&lt;ref name="Clow52"&gt;
Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is "[[wikt:lixiviate|lixiviated]]" (extracted with water) from the ashes of the burned, dried plants. The resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished barilla. A very similar process is used to obtain [[potash]] (mainly [[potassium carbonate]]) from the ashes of hardwood trees. The best Spanish barilla—prepared by master ''barrilleros''—contained about 30% Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1877 Kingzett described the importance of the barilla trade to Spain as follows: "So highly was the product valued, and the importance of the trade regarded, that by the laws of Spain the exportation of the seed was an offence punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;Kingzett, Charles Thomas (1877). ''The History, Products, and Processes of the Alkali Trade, Including the Most Recent Improvements'' (Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., London), p. 69. [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUJAAAAIAAJ Online version] retrieved July 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors indicate that "barilla" was a specific plant used for soda ash production; this usage is erroneous, but presumably corresponds to the common usage of "barilla plant" exclusively for ''Salsola soda''. Perhaps this common usage itself reflects an old error in assuming that a single plant species was used by the Spaniards for their industry. In still earlier times, the sources of soda ash and the methods of processing it were secrets that were zealously guarded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">'''Business Intelligence 2.0''' ('''BI 2.0''') is a future development of the existing [[business intelligence]] model that began in the mid-2000s, where data can be obtained from many sources. The process allows for the querying of real-time corporate data by employees, but approaches the data with a [[web browser]] based solution. This is in contrast to previous proprietary querying tools that characterizes previous BI software.

The growth in [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA) is one of the main factors for this happening. BI 2.0 is intended to be more flexible and adaptive than normal business intelligence. [[Data exchange]] processes also differ, with [[XBRL]] (Extensible Business Reporting Language), [[Web Service]]s and various [[Semantic Web]] [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]] enable using data external to an organization, such as [[benchmarking]] type information.

Business Intelligence 2.0 is believed to have been named after [[Web 2.0]], although it takes elements from both Web 2.0 (a focus on user empowerment and community collaboration, technologies like [[RSS]] and the concept of [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]s), and the [[Semantic Web]], sometimes called "Web 3.0" ([[semantic integration]] through shared ontologies to enable easier exchange of data).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = intelligententerprise.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to analytics expert Neil Raden, BI 2.0 also implies a move away from the standard [[data warehouse]] that business intelligence tools have used, which "will give way to context, contingency and the need to relate information quickly from many sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8027">The '''Canada Agricultural Products Act''' (CAPA) institutes the [[Board of Arbitration]] and the [[Review Tribunal]], the decisions of which are cognizable by the [[Federal Court of Canada]]. Registered Establishments and Accredited Laboratories are under its purview, as are national Trade-Marks and Trade in agricultural products. It also enables the Inspectorate to search and to seize agricultural products.&lt;ref name=capa02&gt;[http://canlii.ca/t/hxzn canlii.ca: ``Canada Agricultural Products Act, RSC 1985, c 20 (4th Supp)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAPA enables the so-called ''Livestock and Poultry Carcass Grading Regulations'', a voluntary programme established for the better communication between retailers and consumers.&lt;ref name=ibg&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/retail-food/information-bulletins/beef-grades/eng/1331664546794/1331664630169 inspection.gc.ca: "Beef Grades – Retail Labelling &amp; Advertising Guidelines"], 2017-10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Now governed by the [[Canadian Beef Grading Agency]], the Canadian grading system began in 1929. Grade standards and regulations are now enforced by [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] employees. Significant changes were introduced to the grading system in 1992, 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref name=crmb&gt;[http://www.crmb.ca/beef_grading.php crmb.ca: "CANADIAN BEEF GRADING PROGRAM"], consulted June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The information collected through the grading process is used in making marketing and production decisions. Producers receive premiums for carcasses with a high grade. In 2016, the General Manager of the CBGA maintained that virtually all fed beef carcasses processed commercially in Canada were graded.&lt;ref name=brca&gt;[http://www.beefresearch.ca/research-topic.cfm/carcass-grading-41 beefresearch.ca: "Carcass Grading"], 26 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2016, there were 30 [[crop]]s, of which [[apple]]s and [[potato]]es were two,&lt;ref name=ip17/&gt; that came under the purview of the CAPA legislation.&lt;ref name=igca&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/fresh-fruits-and-vegetables/imports-and-interprovincial-trade/ministerial-exemptions-apples/eng/1352494295645/1352494372468#s1 inspection.gc.ca: ``Guidelines for Requesting and Administering Ministerial Exemptions for Apples''], 24 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Two executives of Mucci International Marketing Inc. and Mucci Pac Ltd. and their companies were levied fines by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency|CFIA]] tribunal that totalled $1.5 million. Their offense was fraudulently to put "Product of Canada" labels on large quantities of [[Bell pepper|peppers]], [[tomato]]es and [[cucumber]]s grown mainly in [[Mexico]]. The defendants supplied the mislabelled produce to [[Costco]], to [[Loblaws]] and to [[Sobeys]]. The fraud at the [[Ontario Food Terminal]] was discovered in 2012, and investigators later executed in 2013 and 2014 three [[search warrants]], which resulted in the seizure of more than 70 boxes of documents. A court in [[Windsor, Ontario]] heard the case. The agreed statement of facts quoted an email of a Mucci worker, that he was told "to make it Canada even though it is Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/it-says-product-of-canada-but-is-it-the-growing-problem-of-ferreting-out-counterfeit-vegetables financialpost.com: ``It says 'Product of Canada' but is it? The growing problem of ferreting out counterfeit vegetables''], 29 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The company, which was at the time located in [[Kingsville, Ontario]], was also sentenced to [[probation]] for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/kingsville-company-fined-1-5m-for-misrepresenting-products-country-of-origin-1.3621671 cbc.ca: "Kingsville company fined $1.5M for misrepresenting products' country of origin"], 8 Jun 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Apples are one of 30 domestically produced commodities whose trade is regulated the Canada Agricultural Products Act. The [[Canadian International Trade Tribunal]] ruled in 1995 that American dumping of a number of apple varietals "has caused, is causing and is likely to cause material injury to the production in Canada of like goods, excluding the period from July 1 to September 30 in each calendar year." As such, American growers are currently required to secure a ministerial exemption from the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] for bulk apple shipments. The CAPA was threatened in 2017 by [[President Trump]]'s renewal of [[NAFTA]] negotiations. Potatoes are another issue of contention under NAFTA negotiations: [[Canadian Horticulture Council]] trade chair Ken Forth told a Commons committee the CAPA "eliminate the potential dumping of large quantities of potatoes" that may not meet Canadian grade requirements. "Such dumping could severely impact the market price for high-quality Canadian products."&lt;ref name=ip17&gt;[https://ipolitics.ca/2017/06/27/forbidden-fruit-canadas-produce-industry-is-a-possible-nafta-target/ ipolitics.ca: ``Forbidden fruit: Canada’s produce industry is a possible NAFTA target'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2016, The maximum fine for an indictable offence under the Canada Agricultural Products Act was $250,000.&lt;ref name=pcom&gt;[https://www.producer.com/2017/03/ont-company-faces-legal-action-on-several-fronts/ producer.com: "Ont. company faces legal action on several fronts"], 9 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, a [[Maidstone, Ontario]] tomato processing company, that in addition had received a controversial $3-million provincial grant, was convicted of  fraudulently mislabelling products as [[Organic product|organic]] under the CAPA as well as other legislation. The owner and the company were also charged with falsifying the country of origin on their products between September 2013 and July 2015, passing off with labels that read "Product of Canada" produce that was American in origin. The owner was charged with lying to a federal food inspector on 8 January 2015. The case was heard in the [[Ontario Court of Justice]]. Separately, the company went bankrupt, owing more than a hundred creditors a total of over $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/thomas-canning-to-plead-guilty-to-mislabelling-products-as-organic windsorstar.ca: "Thomas Canning to plead guilty to mislabelling products as organic"], 12 Oct 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcom/&gt;

On 12 March 2018, a [[Leamington, Ontario]] greenhouse grower named AMCO Produce and its directors Fausto Amicone and Mark Wehby answered to charges brought by the CFIA for origin-of-vegetable fraud in a Windsor court. The corporation pleaded guilty to three charges under the [[Food and Drugs Act]], the [[Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act]] and the CAPA, and was fined $210,000.&lt;ref name=tpc21&gt;[https://www.thepacker.com/article/ontario-greenhouse-group-responds-amco-verdict thepacker.com: ``Ontario greenhouse group responds to Amco verdict''], 21 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals were let off in exchange for the guilty plea.&lt;ref name=ws13/&gt; The sentence included "intrusive" probation for a period of time under which the CFIA gains "unfettered" access to company records.&lt;ref name=ws13/&gt; The case began when the CFIA did in February 2013 a random inspection at the Ontario Food Terminal. Greenhouse peppers had been fraudulently mislabelled as Ontario produce at a time of year that was too cold for greenhouses to operate. The case covered offenses that occurred over a two-year span of time.&lt;ref name=tpc20&gt;[https://www.thepacker.com/article/canadian-company-fined-mislabeling-mexican-produce thepacker.com: ``Canadian company fined for mislabeling Mexican produce''], 20 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ws13&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/amco-produce-fined-210k-for-passing-off-foreign-vegetables-as-canadian windsorstar.com: "AMCO Produce fined $210K for passing off foreign vegetables as Canadian"], 13 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Svanberg holds honorary doctorates from [[Luleå University of Technology]] and [[Linköping University]].

Svanberg served as [[CEO]] of telecom company [[Ericsson]] from 8 April 2003 to 31 December 2009. Following his resignation, he remained on the board of Ericsson and holds 3,234,441 shares in the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/press/releases/2009/06/1324827&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/board_directors/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820035124/http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/board_directors/index.shtml |archivedate=20 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining Ericsson, he led another Swedish industrial company - [[Assa Abloy]]. Svanberg serves on other boards, including:
* The [[investment company]] [[Melker Schörling]] AB
* [http://www.stockholmchallenge.se/node/66 Stockholm Challenge Advisory Board]

Svanberg joined the BP board as chairman-designate on 1 September 2009, and succeeded [[Peter Sutherland]] as chairman on 1 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BP Selects New Chairman to Succeed Peter Sutherland |url=http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/press/press-releases/bp-selects-new-chairman-to-succeed-peter-sutherland.html |publisher=[[BP]] |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704105637/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/press/press-releases/bp-selects-new-chairman-to-succeed-peter-sutherland.html |archivedate=4 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife Agneta, an associate professor at Uppsala University, filed for divorce on 17 September 2009. They were married for 26 years and have three children together. Svanberg is a dedicated fan of [[Djurgårdens IF]] and serves on the board of [[Djurgårdens IF Hockey]]. He is a former [[ice hockey]] player himself, having played for [[IF Björklöven]] in [[Umeå]] during his youth.

Svanberg has received the ''Lifetime Achievement Award'', given out by the security trade magazine [[Detektor]], for his work in Assa Abloy and [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityworldhotel.com/se/Nyheter/Foretagsnyheter/carl-henric-svanberg-fick-detektors-hederspris#.VdeGFou9WX0|title=Carl-Henric Svanberg fick Detektors hederspris|work=securityworldhotel.com|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deepwater Horizon oil spill==
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}
On 16 June 2010, Svanberg met with US President [[Barack Obama]] to discuss BP's responsibility for the effects of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]. He caused a PR uproar by afterwards expressing BP's concern for the common people along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] whose livelihood is threatened by the oil spill by saying, "We care about the small people", drawing upon a Swedish phrase, ''den lilla människan''. The correct translation of the Swedish phrase would have been "the common person". Svanberg subsequently apologized for the term and attributed his unfortunate choice of words to a "slip in translation".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Gerhart.

'''Central''' (also '''Central District'''; {{zh|t=中環}}) is the [[central business district]] of [[Hong Kong]]. It is located in [[Central and Western District]], on the north shore of [[Hong Kong Island]], across [[Victoria Harbour]] from [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], the southernmost point of [[Kowloon Peninsula]]. The area was the heart of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]], although that name is rarely used today.

As the central business district of Hong Kong, it is the area where many multinational [[financial institution|financial services corporation]]s have their headquarters. Consulates general and consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is [[Government Hill]], the site of the government headquarters. The area, with its proximity to Victoria Harbour, has served as the centre of trade and financial activities from the earliest days of the [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|British colonial era]] in 1841, and continues to flourish and serve as the place of administration after the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] to China in 1997.

The area of '''Chung Wan'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zfLImz3BT30/SqB6_YTNnvI/AAAAAAAAAZo/pUyeHQoxbSc/s1600/c+1880+victoria.jpg#www.omuser.com/archiver/?tid-169962.html Map of circa 1880]&lt;/ref&gt;  ({{lang|zh-hk|中環}}), named Central in English, was one of the districts ({{lang|zh-hk|四環九約}}) in Victoria City. The English name ''Central'' became prevalent after the [[Island Line (MTR)|Island Line]] of the [[MTR]] metro system was built in the early 1980s, and the connected [[metro station|stations]] of Pedder and Chater renamed as ''[[Central (MTR)|Central]]''.  On some older maps, it and the area to its west are named '''Kwan Tai Lo''' ({{lang|zh-hk|羣帶路}}) below [[Victoria Peak]]. It formed a channel, '''Chung Mun''' ({{lang|zh-hk|中門}}), with [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], on the sea route along the coast of [[Northern and southern China|southern China]].  The eastern part of Central District has been known as [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]] since the completion of [[Admiralty (MTR)|Admiralty Station]] in the early 1980s.

==Location==
Central is located on the north shore of [[Hong Kong Island]], across [[Victoria Harbour]] from [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], the southernmost point of [[Kowloon Peninsula]]. It is bordered in the west by [[Sheung Wan]], with the border being along [[Aberdeen Street]] (also called [[Wing Kut Street]]). It is bordered in the east by [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]], an eastern extension of the central business district. As such, Admiralty is sometimes considered a part of Central. Central is bordered in the south by [[Mid-levels]], an area halfway up [[Victoria Peak]]. The boundary between Central and Mid-levels is not clearly defined.

For [[Central and Western District Council|district council]] elections purposes, the area, together with Admiralty, correspond roughly to the "Chung Wan" constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eac.gov.hk/pdf/distco/maps/dc2003a.pdf District Council electoral boundaries – Central and Western District]&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of such constituencies may be subject to modification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201012/03/P201012030246.htm Press release: "Public consultation on proposed constituency boundaries for 2011 District Council Election", December 3, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hong Kongfromtheharbour c1920.JPG|thumb|left|Central waterfront in the 1920s.]]
[[Image:Hong Kong Legislative Council Building.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Court of Final Appeal Building]], completed in 1912, once used as the building of [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] from 1985 to 2011.]]
The British landed on [[Possession Point]] of [[Sheung Wan]] in 1841. They soon decided to build a city on the north coast of Hong Kong Island, and the present-day Central was chosen to house major military facilities and an administrative centre. The area soon attracted both [[Westerners]] and Chinese to trade and live in the area, and a [[Canton Bazaar]] (precursor of [[Central Market, Hong Kong|Central Market]]) was built between [[Cochrane Street]] and [[Graham Street]] in 1842. The area was soon zoned for Westerners only, and the Chinese residents were restricted to Sheung Wan. [It was zoned for "Western-style buildings," meaning buildings with minimum space and hygiene standards]. The area was largely dominated by the presence of Victoria City. The popularity of this area would also boost the [[Demographics of Hong Kong|population of Hong Kong]] from 5,000 in 1841 to 24,000 in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The British Empire in the nineteenth century: its progress and expansion at home and abroad|last= Sanderson|first= Edgar |authorlink=Edgar Sanderson|volume= IV|year= 1897–1898|publisher= [[Blackie and Son]]|location= London|isbn= | oclc = 11625716| lccn = 02002538|page= 337|pages= |url= https://archive.org/details/britishempireinn04sandiala|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Government House, Hong Kong|Government House]] and other [[Hong Kong Government]] buildings were completed during this period on [[Government Hill]]. Various barracks, naval base and residence of Commander, [[Flagstaff House]] were built on the east end of the district. Between 1860 and 1880 the construction of City Hall, Theatre Royal and other financial structures made Central the heart of Hong Kong.

In 1904 the [[Praya Reclamation Scheme]] added {{convert|59|acre|ha}} of land to Central's waterfront.  Many of the proposals came from [[Sir Paul Chater]] and [[James Johnstone Keswick]].&lt;ref&gt;Wordie, Jason. [2002] (2002) Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. {{ISBN|962-209-563-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1920s, Hong Kong was able to push far ahead economically, because of the cohesive collaboration between Central and all waterfront commerce.

The military structures survived until the 1980s. Only Flagstaff House remains as Museum of Tea Ware in [[Hong Kong Park]]. [[City Hall, Hong Kong|City Hall]] sat on the present premises of the [[HSBC]] [[HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building|Hong Kong headquarters]]. Hong Kong's first road, [[Queen's Road, Hong Kong|Queen's Road]], passes through the area and the business centre continued to expand toward the shoreline as far as the reclaimed lands.

'''Deputy mayor''' is an elective or appointive office of the second-ranking official in many local governments.

==Duties and functions==
Many elected vice-mayors are members of the [[city council]] who are given the title and serve as [[acting mayor]] in the mayor's absence. Appointive deputy mayors serve at the pleasure of the [[mayor]] and may function as [[chief operating officer]]s. 

There may be within the same municipal government one or more deputy mayors appointed to oversee policy areas together with a popularly-elected '''vice mayor''' who serves as the mayor's successor in the event the office is vacated by death, resignation, disability, or [[impeachment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-deputy-mayor-do.htm |title=What does a Deputy Mayor do? (with picture) |website=Wisegeek.com |date=2016-12-29 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cities the vice mayor presides over the city council, and may not vote except to break ties. Like the deputy mayor in other systems, the popularly elected vice mayor becomes acting mayor in the mayor's absence. As previously noted, in some few cities, this office is elected separately and does not entail the elevation by the council of one of its members to be [[speaker (politics)|speaker]]. In some U.S. cities, the mayor and deputy or vice mayor run together as a ticket similar to how the [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] run at the national level.

===New York City, USA===
In [[New York City]], there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the [[Deputy Mayor of New York City|First Deputy Mayor]] serves as the general deputy mayor for the [[Mayor of New York City]].

===St. Louis, Missouri, USA===
In [[St. Louis, Missouri]], there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the deputy Mayors serves as the general deputy's  mayors for the [[Mayor of St. Louis]].

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], according to the [[Local Authorities (Election and Term of Mayor and Deputy Mayors) Act, 5735-1975]], a [[Mayor]] is usually elected in "personal, general, direct, equal and secret elections", with election by a local council being made only if no candidate runs for mayor, a candidate for mayor in a single-candidate election is rejected (in Israel, unlike in the UK, if only one candidate runs he is not automatically elected, and voters would vote either for that candidate or against him), or both candidates advancing to the runoff received an equal number of votes and the tie remains unbroken after adding the number of first-round votes cast for them with the number of second-round votes cast for them. However, deputy mayors are '''always''' elected by the local council, of which one is (or, in certain local authorities two are) the Designated Acting Mayor, elected after nomination by the Mayor.

===France===
The [[French language|French]] term ''député-maire'' does not mean "deputy mayor", but refers to a mayor who is also a deputy of the [[National Assembly of France]]. As of 31 March 2017, a mayor cannot hold both posts (article LO 141-1 of the electoral code).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-elections-en-France/Le-cumul-des-mandats-electoraux&lt;/ref&gt; The term for deputy mayor in french is ''Maire adjoint''.

===Davao City, Philippines===
In [[Davao City]], there is both an elected vice-mayor as a direct constitutionally mandated deputy of the [[Mayor of Davao City]] and appointed deputy mayors. The deputy mayors are appointed to administer each ethnic minorities situated in Davao City.

'''Eulalio Ferrer Rodríguez''' (26 February 1921, [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] - 25 March 2009, [[Mexico City]]) was a Spanish-Mexican entrepreneur, involved in communications and advertising. In 1960, he and some associates created a company called "Anuncios Modernos" (Modern Advertising). Later, he created his own company, now known as "{{ill|Ferrer Comunicación|es}}", or "Grupo Ferrer". He was a member of the [[Academia Mexicana de la Lengua]] (AML).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.org.mx/miembros.php?tipo=2 Members of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109013500/http://www.academia.org.mx/miembros.php?tipo=2 |date=2010-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
At the age of 16, he became the local secretary of the [[Socialist Youth of Spain]] in Santander. Three years later, he was the youngest Captain in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. When the war turned in favor of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]], he fled to France and, after spending some time at the refugee camp in [[Camp de concentration d'Argelès-sur-Mer|Argelès-sur-Mer]], he emigrated to Mexico. 

In 1987, the [[Menéndez Pelayo International Prize]] was established with the help of a generous grant from Ferrer. Four years later, he was elected to fill Seat XXII at the AML. His first speech was on the subject of the use of language in advertising. In 2000, he became the group's Treasurer. Among his notable lectures were "The Grammar of Color" and "Remembering [[Jules Verne]]". He was also a regular contributor to the "Lengua Viva" section in the newspaper, ''[[Reforma]]''

Following his initiative, in 1992 the REA recognized the verb "[[Cantinflas|cantinflear]]", meaning "to speak in an absurd and incongruous way, while saying nothing" or "to act in the same manner". 

In addition to his membership at AML, he was a corresponding member of the [[Real Academia Española]] (REA) and the [[North American Academy of the Spanish Language]] as well as a full member of the [[Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística]].
 
In 2012, the Fundación Cervantina de México established the "Premio Internacional Eulalio Ferrer" to "distinguish outstanding personalities who have excelled by their contributions to know, understand and enhance those aspects that define what it means to be human".

'''Food marketing''' brings together the [[food producer]] and the [[consumer]] through a chain of [[marketing]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;"Food Marketing," in Oxford Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, Brian Wansink, New York: Oxford University Press, 501-503.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{POV check|section|date=August 2018}}
The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect nongovernment employer in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Pomeranz &amp; Adler, 2015, define food marketing is defined as a chain of marketing activities that take place within the food system between a food organisation and the consumer.&lt;ref name="pomeranz2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pomeranz | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Adler | first2 = S. | year = 2015 | title = Defining Commercial Speech in the Context of Food Marketing | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 40–43 | doi = 10.1111/jlme.12213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to be a complicated procedure, as there are many processes that are used prior to the sale the food product. These include [[food processing]], wholesaling, retailing, food service and transport.&lt;ref name="hawkes2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = C | year = 2007 | title = Regulating and litigating in the public interest: Regulating food marketing to young people worldwide: trends and policy drivers | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 11| pages = 1962–1973 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2006.101162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these many processes, a multitude of organisations have to be involved in the sale of one food product.&lt;ref name="chandon2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandon | first1 = P. | last2 = Wansink | first2 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Does food marketing need to make us fat? A review and solutions | url = | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 10| pages = 571–593 | doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2012.00518.x| pmc = 3495296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, approximately fifty-six organisations are involved in the making of one can of chicken noodle soup.&lt;ref name="pomeranz2015" /&gt; These organisations not only include the processors who make the ingredients for the product, but also involve the companies who manufacture the cans, print the labels and transport the product.&lt;ref name="son2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Son | first1 = H | year = 2015 | title = The history of Western futures studies: An exploration of the intellectual traditions and three-phase periodization | url = | journal = Futures | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 120–137 | doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2014.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, on a global scale, the food marketing industry is one of the largest direct and indirect employers.&lt;ref name="pomeranz2015" /&gt;

For Schaffner &amp; Schroder, 1998, food marketing is the act of communicating to the consumer through a range of marketing techniques in order to add value to a food product and persuade the consumer to purchase. This includes all activities that occur in between the completion of a product through to the purchasing process of consumers.&lt;ref name=schaffner1998&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food marketing management: an international perspective|last=Schaffner|first=D|last2=Schroder|first2=W|last3=Earle|first3=M|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food marketing systems differ worldwide due to the level of development in the particular country, economically and technologically (Kaynak, 1999).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cross-national and cross-cultural issues in food marketing|last=Kaynak|first=E|publisher=International Business Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and interpreting a particular countries food marketing techniques also requires taking into account the socio-economic, cultural, legal-political and technological environment of that country (Kaynak, 1999&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).

== History ==
There are three historical phases of food marketing: the fragmentation phase (before 1870–1880), the unification phase (1880–1950), and the segmentation phase (1950 and later).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tedlow, ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp 4-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Fragmentation phase (pre-1870–1880) ====
In the fragmentation phase, the United States was divided into numerous geographic fragments because transporting food was expensive, leaving most production, distribution, and selling locally based.&lt;ref name=son2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=murata2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murata | first1 = Y | year = 2007 | title = Taste heterogeneity and the scale of production: Fragmentation, unification, and segmentation | url = | journal = Journal of Urban Economics | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 135–160 | doi = 10.1016/j.jue.2006.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unification phase (1880–1950) ====
In the unification phase, distribution was made possible by [[railroads]], coordination of sales forces was made possible by the [[telegraph]] and telephone, and [[product consistency]] was made possible by advances in manufacturing. This new distribution system was led by meat processors such as [[Armour and Company|Armour]] and Swift in midwestern cities and by companies such as [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], [[Quaker Oats]], [[Campbell Soup]], and [[Coca-Cola]], which sold their brands nationally. [[Advertising]] in print media and [[direct marketing]] through demonstrations at stores and public venues were among the prime marketing tools. The initial [[Crisco]] campaign, in 1911, was an example.&lt;ref name=son2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=murata2007/&gt;

==== Segmentation phase (1950 to current) ====

In the segmentation phase (1950 and later) radio, television and [[internet advertising]] made it possible for a wider range of competing products to focus on different benefits and images and thus appeal to different [[demographic]] and [[psychographic]] markets. Distribution via the new national road system strengthened national brands.&lt;ref name=son2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=murata2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Food Industry: Lifeline of America. 2nd ed. (1990) E. C. Hampe, E. C., and M. Wittenbery, New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing mix ==
The four components of food marketing are often called the "four Ps" of the [[marketing mix]] because they relate to product, price, promotion, and place.&lt;ref name=wongleedee&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wongleedee | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Marketing Mix and Purchasing Behavior for Community Products at Traditional Markets | url = | journal = Procedia - Social And Behavioral Sciences, 197(7th World Conference on Educational Sciences) | volume = 197| issue = | pages = 2080–2085 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.07.323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marketing Nutrition]]:  Soy Functional Foods, Biotechnology, and [[Obesity]]'', (2007), Brian Wansink, Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason food manufacturers receive the largest percentage of the retail food dollar is that they provide the most differentiating, [[value-added]] service. The money that manufacturers invest in developing, [[pricing]], promotion, and placing their products helps differentiate a food product on the basis of both quality and [[brand-name recognition]].&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt; Overall, the marketing mix can add value to a food organisation's product.&lt;ref&gt;Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product ===
In deciding what type of new food products a consumer would most prefer, a manufacturer can either try to develop a new food product or try to modify or extend an existing food. For example, a sweet, flavored yogurt drink would be a new product, but milk in a new flavor (such as chocolate strawberry) would be an extension of an existing product. There are three steps to both developing and extending: generate ideas, screen ideas for feasibility, and test ideas for appeal. Only after these steps will a food product make it to national market. Of one hundred new food product ideas that are considered, only six make it to a [[supermarket]] shelf.

The [[food industry]] faces numerous marketing decisions.  Money can be invested in [[brand building]] (through advertising and other forms of promotion) to increase either quantity demanded or the price consumers are willing to pay for a product. [[Coca-Cola]], for example, spends a great deal of money both on perfecting its formula and on promoting the brand.  This allows Coke to charge more for its product than can makers of regional and smaller brands.
Manufacturers may be able to leverage their existing brand names by developing new product lines.  For example, [[Heinz]] started out as a brand for pickles but branched out into ketchup.  Some brand extensions may involve a risk of damage to the original brand if the quality is not good enough.  Coca Cola, for example, refused to apply the Coke name to a diet drink back when artificial sweeteners had a significantly less attractive taste.  Coke created Tab Cola, but only when aspartame (NutraSweet) was approved for use in soft drinks did Coca Cola come out with a Diet Coke.
Manufacturers that have invested a great deal of money in brands may have developed a certain level of consumer brand loyalty—that is, a tendency for consumers to continue to buy a preferred brand even when an attractive offer is made by competitors.  For loyalty to be present, it is not enough to merely observe that the consumer buys the same brand consistently.  The consumer, to be brand loyal, must be able to actively resist promotional efforts by competitors.  A brand loyal consumer will continue to buy the preferred brand even if a competing product is improved, offers a price promotion or premium, or receives preferred display space.  Some consumers have multi-brand loyalty.  Here, a consumer switches between a few preferred brands.  The consumer may either alternate for variety or may, as a rule of thumb, buy whichever one of the preferred brands is on sale.  This consumer, however, would not switch to other brands on sale.  Brand loyalty is, of course, a matter of degree.  Some consumers will not switch for a moderate discount, but would switch for a large one or will occasionally buy another brand for convenience or variety.

The product of the marketing mix refers to the goods and/or services that the organisation will offer to the consumer.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; An organisation can achieve this by either creating a new food product, or by modifying or improving an existing food product.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt; For example, an organic almond yoghurt drink would be considered a new product, whereas a chocolate flavoured milk drink would be an extension of an existing product (Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014). The three steps to develop and extend a food product include generating ideas, analysing the ideas for feasibility and testing ideas for demand. Once these steps have successfully been completed, the food product can then be manufactured to the food market.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt;

=== Price ===
In profitably [[food price|pricing]] the [[food]], the manufacturer must keep in mind that the [[retailer]] adds approximately 50 percent to the price of a wholesale product. For example, a frozen food sold in a retail store for $4.50 generates an income of $3.00 for the manufacturer. This money has to pay for the cost of [[food production|producing]], [[food packaging|packaging]], shipping, storing, and selling the product.

Price encompasses the amount of money paid by the consumer in order to purchase the food product.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; When pricing the food products, the manufacturer must bear in mind that the retailer will add a particular percentage to the price on the wholesale product. This percentage amount differs globally.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt; The percentage is used to pay for the cost of producing, packaging, shipping, storing and selling the food product. For example, the purchasing of a food product in a supermarket selling for $3.50 generates an income of $2.20 for the manufacturer.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt;

=== Promotion ===
[[Promotion (marketing)|Promoting]] a food to consumers is done out of store, in store, and on package. Advertisements on television and in magazines are attempts to persuade consumers to think favorably about a product, so that they go to the store to purchase the product. In addition to advertising, promotions can also include Sunday [[newspaper ad]]s that offer coupons such as [[cents-off]] and [[Buy one, get one free|buy-one-get-one-free]] offers.

Promotion of the marketing mix is defined as the actions used to communicate a food product's features and benefits; therefore, persuading the consumer to purchase the product.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; There are multiple avenues used to promote a food product to consumers. Some examples are out-of-store, in-store and on the packaging (Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014). Food advertisements on television are used to attract the consumer, persuading them to go to the store and purchase that food product. Additionally, promotions in magazines and newspapers may offer coupons for food products (Frechette, 2015).

=== Place ===
Place refers to the [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[warehousing]] efforts necessary to move a food from the manufacturer to a location where a consumer can buy it. It can also refer to where the [[product placement|product is located]] in a retail outlet (e.g., the end of an aisle; the top, bottom, or middle shelf; in a special display case, etc.).

The food marketing system in the United States is an amazingly flexible one. Consumer focus helps marketers anticipate the demands of consumers, and production focus helps them respond to changes in the market. The result is a system that meets and influences the ever-changing demands of consumers.

Place refers to the activities that organisations go about in order to make its food product available to its consumers. This encompasses the distribution necessary to move a food product from the manufacturer to a location where it can be purchased by the consumer.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; Product location in a store is also a definition of place in the marketing mix. For example, a particular place in an aisle, a shelf or a display in a supermarket (Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014).

== Segmentation ==
In order to market its food products, an organisation must first understand whether its product will satisfy the consumer's needs better than competitors do (Noori, 2015). In order to achieve this, an organisation must understand the four types of segmentation.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt;

=== Geographic ===

An organisation must understand where it is marketing its food products to in a geographical sense (Schlanger &amp; Maas, 2013). Clarifying this will help an organisation to grasp which food products will satisfy the needs of a particular consumer culture (Adeigbe, Baldwin, Gallion, Grier &amp; Ramirez, 2015). For example, researching whether the consumer lives in America or Asia; or, whether the consumer lives in a city or a rural area (Schlanger &amp; Maas, 2013). By understanding these aspects, the organisation will be able to identify that a consumers' food needs differ depending on where they live.

=== Demographic ===

A food organisation must understand the [[demographic]] segment that it will be marketing towards (David, Schramm-Kelin, Rank &amp; Wanger, 2015). Factors that must be considered are a consumer's age, gender, education, social class, income, religion and ethnicity (Quinn &amp; Dibb, 2010). All of these aspects can impact whether the consumer will prefer one food product over another.

=== Psychographic ===

A food organisation must understand its consumer [[psychographic]]. Factors such as lifestyle, personalities, opinions, activities and interests of its potential consumers must considered (Schlanger &amp; Maas, 2013). Identifying these aspects can help an organisation to improve its food products.

=== Behaviour ===

A food organisation must understand how its consumers may behave towards a food product (David, Schramm-Kelin, Rank &amp; Wanger, 2015). For example, information researching the benefits sought, frequency of food purchase, attitude towards the food product and nutritional knowledge of the product are all beneficial (Noori, 2015).

== Criticism ==
In recent years, food marketing has been criticised by professionals as being a major factor in contributing to [[childhood obesity]]. Nestle (2006) suggests that food marketing purposely targets children who are easily influenced at such a young age to eat high-sugar drinks and food with little nutritional benefit.&lt;ref name=nestle2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nestle | first1 = M | year = 2006 | title = Food Marketing and Childhood Obesity — A Matter of Policy | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 2527–2529 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp068014 | pmid=16775233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that areas of food marketing are linked to obesity is concerning, as well as how easy it is to market to children and affect their food choices. Television and print media still stand as the traditional communication channels for food marketing, but other popular approaches are also more prevalent these days. These include the Internet, toys, packaging, video games, blockbuster films, character licensing of children's toys and celebrity advertising (McGinnis, Appleton Gootman, &amp; Kraak, 2006). The employment of these food marketing strategies are growing, and are said to be partly responsible for swelling rates of childhood obesity (Cartere, 2009).

Product placement in children's films and television shows gives food marketers more power to get children familiar with their brand and to directly interact with this market segment (Cartere, 2009). The power brands have through food marketing on television is significant because television audiences automatically are more enticed in an advertisement as it is playing in front of them, forming stronger predispositions for brands (Kline, 2010). Accusations come into play when this saturation happens as children are not equipped with adequate knowledge to make smart nutritional choices, and food marketing is therefore sometimes blamed for children's unhealthy lifestyles (Kline, 2010). Children are a fast expanding market segment, firstly because they yield influence over their parents buying, but also because they are future consumers themselves (Cartere, 2009). Food marketers capitalize on the fact most children trouble their parents for a product they have seen on television until they receive it, giving children high bargaining power. According to McGinnis et al. (2006), by the time children are two years old, the majority can identify brands in supermarkets and demand them by name. It has been argued that marketers also portray some foods to children as exclusive only to them, implying children know better about their nutrition than their parents. This has in turn seen trends of children disregarding parental advice and taking it upon themselves to pick and choose what they eat.&lt;ref name=nestle2006/&gt;

Food marketers also use appealing packaging to attract children to their product through bright colours, including toys in schemes (McDonald's Happy Meals with a toy included is an example) and utilising famous television or film characters to spark interest (Cartere, 2009). In terms of packaging, brands will also change the size of products to entice children. Large companies have further been criticised of contributing to obesity through supplying schools with branded sponsorships and sports merchandise such as rugby balls that flaunt a company's logo (Cartere, 2009). Food marketers are criticised further than being responsible for child obesity rates, and are said to not have children's long-term physical wellbeing in mind when they aim to rapidly create brand name association among children (Frechette, 2015).

=== Childhood obesity ===

It has been shown through Frechette's (2015) studies that in recent years, as children and teenagers have become more exposed to technological advances, they have become more susceptible to unhealthy food marketing commercial messages from food organisations (Cairns, Angus, Hastings &amp; Caraher, 2013). Harris, Pomeranz, Lobstein, &amp; Brownell (2009) suggest that food marketers have been using child-targeting marketing practices in order to persuade children to eat unhealthy or poorly suitable foods. Organisations achieve this through direct and indirect marketing tactics on television adverts, games, social media and food packaging (Freeman, Kelly, Baur, Chapman, Chapman, Gill &amp; King, 2014). These tactics have an explicit effect on children's consumption patterns, diet-related health, nutritional knowledge, purchase behaviour and preferences (Vandevijvere &amp; Swinburn, 2015). Overall, it has been found that food marketing is one of the leading contributors to an increase in childhood obesity (Schor &amp; Ford, 2007). This is increasingly becoming a global issue.&lt;ref name=chandon2012/&gt;

In order to prevent the current unhealthy food marketing culture, Sacks, Mialon, Vandevijvere, Trevena, Snowdon, Crino &amp; Swinburn (2015) believe that there are methods and policies that should be put into place by governments. Firstly, parents should be informed of the nutritional values of the foods that they are giving to their children (Grier, Mensinger, Huang, Kumanyika &amp; Stettler, 2007). For example, an easy-to-read nutritional label on food packaging that provides the nutrient values and their definitions (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015). This will create healthier food environments for families around the world (Sacks et al., 2015). Secondly, parents could restrict which advertisements that their children are exposed to (Newman &amp; Oates, 2014). For example, parents could use ad-blocking applications or limit television watching time (Thaichon &amp; Quach, 2016). Through the implementation of these strategies, governments can contribute in decreasing the rates of childhood obesity through food marketing.&lt;ref name=hawkes2007/&gt;

=== Misleading nutritional information ===

In order to persuade consumers to buy food products, organisations may present misleading nutritional information on its food products (Schermel, Emrich, Arcand, Wong &amp; L'abbé, 2013). It has become more prevalent that food organisations are not entirely transparent in regard to what is contained in its food products. For example, saturated fats, sodium and added sugars (Harris, LoDolce &amp; Schwartz, 2015). Wording such as "less sugar", "fat free" and "all natural" lead consumers to believe that the foods they are consuming are healthy (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015). Sacks et al. (2015) discusses that in order to prevent misleading food advertising, governments should implement policies regarding the placement of verified nutritional values on food packaging.

== Purchasing decisions ==
Food marketing not only involves the marketing of products to consumers, but the reasons why consumers purchase these items and the factors influencing such choices (Sahay, Stough, Sohal, &amp; Goyal, 2006). Demographics, values and attitudes, incentives, and price willingness to pay are all elements that drive buyer selection in the marketing of food.

Firstly, food marketers must be aware that the attitudes and values of their target market play a significant role in what they choose to buy. For example, in terms of the green brand market, consumers will first be environmentally conscious and therefore intend to buy such products. Once a product has been marketed to a consumer, they need to feel that they are contributing to the preservation of the environment to purchase something (Kapuge, 2016). Consumers that have concern for the environment tend to alter their behavior to be more environmentally friendly. Values and attitudes have been found to be the driving force of sustainable purchasing behavior (Kapuge, 2016). Marketers need to convey to their consumer market through information that some items have adverse effects on the environment. Brands need to also relay the values of food marketing to customers when communicating with them (Sahay et al., 2006).

In relation to knowledge and beliefs in variables affecting food marketing decisions, it has been suggested that someone's understanding of products helps anticipate their ecologically friendly actions (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015). Because a persons awareness of information can cause them to make more informed or less informed decisions about products shows knowledge is a major factor in consumer buying choices. When strategists are food marketing, it is important to create binding relationships with potential customers through understanding their beliefs and awareness about the marketed product (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015).

Demographics play a large role in determining the background of consumers and how food marketing operates. Such as age allows a brand to market its food towards certain age groups according to their wants. Education also comes into play because often education is associated with people buying better food (Sahay et al., 2006). Income alike sees if people have more disposable income to spend on good products. Gender further allows food marketers to target women especially because women have been found to do the majority of food shopping in families (Sahay et al., 2006).

Signage conveys a lot about a brand, for example what type of food they sell, the ingredients, where it was made and the cost of the products. Signage precisely communicates with the buyer and is an essential way to affect feelings and brain processes of a person (Remar, Campbell, &amp; DiPietro, 2016). Findings show that certain digital signposting of a brand influences consumer perception and behavior towards a product, meaning food marketing strategies like this are very effective in brand positioning (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015).

Lastly, consumer price willingness to pay is another tool used in food marketing to track how much a person is prepared to pay for a product. Marketers can take note of people's readiness to pay to see if they would indeed buy their product (Remar et al., 2016). Studies have shown that consumers are prepared to spend more on an item if it is environmentally friendly and portrays them as having sustainable behavior in society (Remar et al., 2016). Additionally, it has been explored that consumers will for example pay substantially more (almost 50%) for food produce that is said to be grown locally as opposed to grown in the wider country or imported (Remar et al., 2016). This is vital information when it comes to food marketing and helps companies make informed decisions about their food marketing strategies.

== Food marketing via sponsorships ==
Corporate spending on sponsorship worldwide grew 5.1% in 2015 reaching $57.5 billion, with the biggest spenders on sponsorships being food and beverage giants [[PepsiCo]] and [[Coca-Cola]], spending $350m and $290m respectively.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sponsorship.com/Resources/Sponsorship-Spending-Report--WhereThe-Dollars-Are.aspx.|title=Sponsorship spending report: Where the dollars are going and trends for 2015|last=International Events Group (IEG)|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional sporting events are primary targets for food companies when utilising sponsorship as a form a marketing communication, however sports organisations are increasingly demanding high prices for access to their exploitable marketing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrillat|first=François Anthony|last2=Colbert|first2=Francois|last3=Feigné|first3=Matthieu|date=2012|title=Weapons of mass intrusion: the leveraging of ambush marketing strategies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francois_Colbert/publication/263245341_Weapons_of_mass_intrusion_The_leveraging_of_ambush_marketing_strategies/links/542d3f090cf27e39fa9421f7/Weapons-of-mass-intrusion-The-leveraging-of-ambush-marketing-strategies.pdf|journal=European Journal of Marketing|volume=48|pages=314–335|doi=10.1108/ejm-11-2011-0641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food and beverage company [[MillerCoors]] were willing to spend $3.8m for a 30-second commercial during [[Super Bowl XLVII]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Global food brand have also been seen to increase their marketing effort through sponsorships of amateur sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M.G|date=2012|title=Corporate sponsorship in high school athletics.|url=|journal=Walton College of business|volume=|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Yum! Brands]] paid $13.5m to name a university basketball stadium the ‘bucket’, creating the [[KFC]] stadium, similarly [[Papa John's Pizza|Papa John’s]] purchased the naming rights of a college stadium for $5M. Food companies are also investing millions into individual athletes in return for accesses to their exploitable commercial potential. [[Peyton Manning]] reportedly earns $10M per year from sponsorship alone, with the highest percentage of sponsorship coming from Papa John’s and [[Gatorade]]; similarly [[Kobe Bryant]]’s sponsorship from [[McDonald's]] was reportedly worth $12M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bragg|first=Marie A.|last2=Yanamadala|first2=Swati|last3=Roberto|first3=Christina A.|last4=Harris|first4=Jennifer L.|last5=Brownell|first5=Kelly D.|date=2015|title=Athlete endorsements in food marketing|url=http://www.peachlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bragg.AthleteEndorse.Pediatrics.pdf|journal=Public health and nutrition|volume=57|issue=5|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics of sponsorship strategies ===
With regards to marketing according to Liaw and Tam (2015), ethics deals with moral principles behind the operation of marketing.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liaw|first=S.T|last2=Tam|first2=C.W.M|date=2015|title=Ethical research or research ethics?|url=|journal=Australian Family Physician|volume=44|issue=7|pages=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main ethical issue surrounding  sponsorship being utilised as a form of marketing communication by food companies is the sponsorship of sport from perceived unhealthy food and beverage companies, such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola’s sponsorship of the [[Olympic Games|Olympics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;]][[Food marketing#cite%20note-%3A6-19|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Food marketing#cite note-:6-19|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Food marketing#cite note-:6-19|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2012/07/05/olympics.2012.ban_McDonalds&amp;Coke|title=China grabs cut of star athletes Lui Xiang’s gold|last=Sheridan|first=M.|date=2008|work=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different in many ways, similarities have been drawn between the marketing practices of tobacco companies and the food industry. At major sporting events, customers are exposed to a multitude of food-related sponsorship, with sponsorship associated with products classed as unhealthy twice as common as those classed as healthy (32.7% versus 15.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grunseit|first=A.C|last2=MacNiven|first2=R|last3=Grassmayr|first3=M|last4=Kelly|first4=B|last5=Davis|first5=D|date=2012|title=Australian athletes? Health behaviors and perceptions of role modelling and marketing of unhealthy products|url=|journal=Health Promotion Journal of Australia|volume=23|pages=63–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsorships of sport from food or beverage companies that are perceived as unhealthy pose great health concern, often being cited as a contributing factor leading to an energy-dense and nutrient poor diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/pcd/2011/08/15/protecting-children-from-harmful-food-marketing-options-for-local-government-to-make-a-difference/|title=CDC - Blogs - Preventing Chronic Disease Dialogue – Protecting Children From Harmful Food Marketing: Options for Local Government to Make a Difference|website=blogs.cdc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ethical concerns with sponsorship being used as a marketing tactic by food companies include; the specific targeting of youths, sponsorship from alcohol brands and the misconceptions created through sponsorships by energy drink brands such as [[Red Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Potential negative outcomes from sponsorship for a sport property|last=Crompton|first=J.L|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Areska|first=J|date=2012|title=The impact of sport sponsorship on brand equity: the analysis of Redbull|url=|journal=Aarhus school of business and social sciences|volume=1|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Via social media and its influences ==
Social media platforms are an effective way for food marketers to enter or attract a market. 'Social media' refers to websites such as Facebook and Twitter, and apps such as Instagram and Facebook. These websites allow users to upload and share content such as information, pictures, opinions and recommendations with the touch of a button. Food companies use unique marketing techniques designed to connect with the consumer such as running competitions, holding free giveaways and creating interactive games and apps. (Freeman et al., 2014)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=B|last2=Kelly|first2=B|last3=Baur|first3=L|last4=Chapman|first4=K|last5=Chapman|first5=S|last6=Gill|first6=T|last7=King|first7=L|date=December 2014|title=Digital Junk: Food and beverage marketing on Facebook|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|doi=10.2105/ajph.2014.302167|volume=104|pages=e56–e64|pmc=4232106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of these techniques are distinctive to social media platforms, as they interact and engage with the consumer on a level that other traditional media platforms are not capable. (Freeman et al., 2014)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Studies have shown that adolescents' share food images on Instagram and that many of these contain brand-related details such as logos (Holmberg et al., 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmberg | first1 = C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = Adolescents' presentation of food in social media: An explorative study | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 121–129 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2016.01.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supermarket catalogues, product placement and their involvement ==
A study of supermarket catalogues distributed globally has also yielded information which supports the claim that food advertising is contributing to rising global obesity levels, especially in countries where the advertising is more prominent, consistent and persuasive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Emma L.|last2=Kähkönen|first2=Laila A.|last3=Sacks|first3=Gary|last4=Cameron|first4=Adrian J.|title=Supermarkets and unhealthy food marketing: An international comparison of the content of supermarket catalogues/circulars|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091743515002753|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=81|pages=168–173|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.08.023|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded with the findings that supermarket catalogues have a major influence on the purchasing decisions and patterns of consumers. (Charlton et al., 2015)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, countries with the most consistent, regular catalogues filled with unhealthy foods were among those testing highest for obesity as well. The study also noted that India and The Philippines were the only countries analysed that advertised a vast majority of healthy foods over unhealthy options. (Charlton et al., 2015).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Product placement is another food marketing technique that draws the consumer in and encourages them to purchase. Vending machines and pop-up sample booths are model examples of product placement techniques used by food marketers. Vending machines provide convenience to the consumer as they are usually stationed in areas with no larger food options nearby, such as university campuses and gyms. Consumers using vending machines will usually pay a slightly higher price for the item, and will usually not be concerned as the price difference accounts for the convenience provided to them.

== Issues ==
There are no set worldwide food marketing laws or legislation, therefore countries have the option to adopt their own legislation with regards to food marketing standards. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcrf.org/int/policy/nourishing-framework/restrict-food-marketing|title=Restrict food marketing {{!}} World Cancer Research Fund International|website=www.wcrf.org|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are usually based on the values, culture and ethics of the particular country (Kaynak, 1999).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many countries worldwide have created laws in order to limit food marketing towards children with the goal of reducing rising obesity levels. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Obesity has been proven to have increased significantly with a link to the increase of food marketing and advertising in society. (Dibb &amp; Lobstein, 2005).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dibb|first=S|last2=Lobstein|first2=T|date=2005|title=Evidence of a possible link between obesogenic food advertising and child overweight.|url=|journal=Obesity Reviews|volume=6|pages=203–208|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789x.2005.00191.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 'call out' from the Worldwide Health Organisation in 2006, many countries adopted to change marketing laws and legislation in order to protect children from persuasive advertisements directly targeted at them. These advertisements are strategically designed with special techniques in order to attract the children's attention.&lt;ref name="publicinterest"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cspinet.org/nutritionpolicy/foodmarketing_abroad.pdf|title=Food marketing in other countries|last=|first=|date=February 16, 2007|website=Centre for science in the public interest|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean Government has taken some of the most drastic steps in 2012 by approving the 'Law of Nutritional Composition of Food and Advertising'. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This law gives strict guidelines for food marketers, allowing no high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar products to be advertised to under 14 year olds or through television or websites with an audience or more than 20% children. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Iran has also taken similar actions, having banned the advertisement of all soft drinks since 2004. Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education has also prepared a document in 2015 containing 24 items in which they hope to prohibit the advertising of in future. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Dibb and Lobstein acknowledge that traditional media outlets only account for approximately 20% of a food marketer's budget, therefore children are still highly exposed to influential advertising in shopping malls and grocery stores, vending machines, sponsored toys, contests etc. (Dibb &amp; Lobstein, 2005).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In addition to Iran and Chile's more extensive legislation's, over 30 countries worldwide have all adopted some form of legislation to protect children and reduce their exposure to advertisements. Some of these countries include Australia, Europe, Canada, Malaysia and Korea.&lt;ref name="publicinterest" /&gt; An example of the type of clauses in the legislation's include prohibiting the use of certain marketing techniques such as using cartoon characters, which can be used to access a child's mind and gain their attention.&lt;ref name="publicinterest" /&gt; Using physiological techniques such as this can be ethically wrong as well as illegal in some countries.

Advertising to children at a young age is a well-established food marketing technique designed to encourage brand preference and holds many ethical dilemmas. Previous studies have concluded that children can recognize and mentally picture brand logos at the age of just six months old, and will verbally request brands at the age of 3 years. (As reported by The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood). Marketing professor James McNeal acknowledged "The Drool Factor" – a study which recognized the fact that babies naturally stare down at their bibs while drooling to see where their drool lands.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10894601|title=Seminar turns spotlight on to selling to our kids|date=2013-07-04|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customizing baby bibs with brand logos has become an effective way for food marketers to imprint their brand into the child's lifestyle, targeting them at a vulnerable young age resulting in brand recognition from the child.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; As a result, when the child is older they will continue to reciprocate warm, fond feelings towards the brand when encountering it in society. This is seen as unethical in many countries and is why organisations such as 'The Campaign for a Commercial-free Childhood' exist and what they aim to reduce.

'''Friedrich Ludwig Balthasar Amelung''' ({{OldStyleDate|23 March|1842|11 March}} – {{OldStyleDate|20 March|1909|7 March}}) was a [[Baltic German]] [[cultural history|cultural historian]], businessman and [[chess endgame]] composer.

Amelung was born at [[Võisiku]] ({{lang-de|Woiseck}}) manor in [[Governorate of Livonia]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Jõgeva County]] in [[Estonia]]). 1862–1864 he studied [[philosophy]] and [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]]. 1864–1879 and 1885–1902 he was the director of the Rõika-[[Meleski]] mirror factory which he inherited from his father. Amelung published writings about the culture and history of Estonian localities like [[Viljandi]], [[Tallinn]] and [[Põltsamaa]].&lt;ref name=tea&gt;{{cite web|title=Amelung, Friedrich|url=http://www.ents.ee:81/PrintArticle.aspx?aid=2312|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217110404/http://www.ents.ee:81/PrintArticle.aspx?aid=2312|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 February 2013|publisher=TEA e-Entsüklopeedia|accessdate=29 January 2013|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amelung was known as a [[chess]] player and a famous chess quiz's author. 1879–1885 he lived in [[Tallinn|Reval]] (now Tallinn) and studied the chess history of the Baltics. Between 1888 and 1908 he edited the [[List of chess periodicals|chess magazine]] ''Baltische Schachblätter''. In 1898 he established the Baltic Chess Society. Amelung published about 230 [[endgame studies]], making him the first chess historian in the Baltic States.&lt;ref name=viljandi&gt;{{cite web|title=23. märts - Friedrich Amelung 170|url=http://uudiskirjandus.blogspot.com/2012/03/23-marts-friedrich-amelung-170.html|publisher=Viljandi Linnaraamatukogu|accessdate=29 January 2013|language=Estonian|date=23 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304205124/http://uudiskirjandus.blogspot.com/2012/03/23-marts-friedrich-amelung-170.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a few games with [[Adolf Anderssen]], [[Gustav Neumann]], [[Carl Mayet]], [[Emil Schallopp]], [[Andreas Ascharin]], [[Emanuel Schiffers]].

He died in 1909 in [[Riga]] and is buried at the [[Kolga-Jaani]] cemetery in Estonia.&lt;ref name=tea/&gt;

'''Government performance management''' (GPM) consists of a set of processes that help government organizations optimize their business performance. It provides a framework for organizing, automating, and analyzing business methodologies, metrics, processes and systems that drive business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management.com/bissues/20070301/2600312-1.html|title=Performance Management for Government|author=Michael Owellen|date=28 February 2007|work=BI Review Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators{{who|date=October 2014}} see GPM as the next generation of [[business intelligence]] (BI) for governments. GPM helps governments to make use of their financial, human, material, and other resources.  In the past, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations; they have struggled to transform strategies into actionable metrics and they have grappled with meaningful analysis to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give profitable insight to their operational decision-makers.  GPM software and methods allow a systematic, integrated approach that links government strategy to core processes and activities. "Running by the numbers" now means something: planning, budgeting, analysis, and reporting can give the measurements that empower management decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O12-performancemanagement.html |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112223214/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O12-performancemanagement.html |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance management (PM) market ==
According to [[Gartner]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, the Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) suite market continues to experience strong momentum, growing 19% during 2007. This is slightly in advance of their earlier market sizing and forecast analysis, which anticipated 2007 revenue to be $1.836&amp;nbsp;million, representing an 18% year-over-year growth. In the latest forecast, Gartner believe that the market for EPM will be more than $3&amp;nbsp;billion by 2011, representing a 14.4% compound annual growth rate. Several factors contributed to the continued significant growth in EPM revenue during 2007:
* Many organizations replaced difficult-to-maintain, inflexible, or outmoded spreadsheets and homegrown financial applications.
* Continued growth in large enterprises was fueled by desires to achieve greater transparency and adherence to governance and compliance legislation.
* Increased demand for applications that support strategic plans and operational activities drove new momentum in the deployment of scorecards.
* There was increased demand from mid-size enterprises, representing one of the largest untapped and dynamic areas of the business application software sector.
* Advertising and PR from increasingly large vendors and system integrators are raising the EPM profile and generating greater demand.

Gartner expects the business Intelligence software market to reach $3 billion in 2009. "Companies around the world have purchased more than US$40&amp;nbsp;billion worth of enterprise applications, including ERP, CRM and HR, during the past few years," said Colleen Graham, principal research analyst at Gartner. "This has generated significant volumes of data in support of the operational processes they automate. By investing in BI, companies can further leverage their enterprise application investments and turn the torrent of data into meaningful insight to better measure performance, respond more quickly to market changes and opportunities and comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_144782_11.html|title=Gartner News Room|publisher=Gartner.com|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Bell''' (October 5, 1919 &amp;ndash; December 4, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[marketer]] and [[merchandising]] executive who co-created [[Woodsy Owl]], the [[iconic]] [[mascot]] of the [[United States Forest Service]]. Bell created Woodsy Owl with two U.S. [[park ranger]]s, [[Chuck Williams (park ranger)|Chuck Williams]] and [[Glenn Kovar]], and another colleague, [[Betty Hite]], for the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|title=Harold Bell, a Creator of Woodsy Owl, Is Dead at 90 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/us/13bell.html|work=[[New York Times]] |publisher=|date=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|title=Harold Bell, merchandising executive who designed the environmentally conscious character Woodsy Owl, dies at 90 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/17/local/la-me-passings17-2009dec17|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=|date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodsy Owl is best known for the [[motto]], ''Give a hoot, don’t pollute!''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Harold Bell was born on October 5, 1919, in [[Union City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was one of three sons born to his parents, David and Hilda Rosenthal Belsky.  His father worked as an [[embroiderer]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Bell served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], following the end of the war.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Career===
Once in Los Angeles, Bell began working as a [[marketer]] and licensing agent for the [[Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He founded his own [[Marketing|marketing firm]] in 1957, which specialized in marketing [[cartoon]], [[television]] and [[film]] characters to the public.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Through his company, Bell helped to [[brand]] and [[license]] such iconic characters as [[Lassie]], the [[Lone Ranger]], [[Dick Tracy]] and [[Mr. Magoo]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Bell, a licensing agent,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; also produced and created a series of [[public service announcements]] for the National Forest Service featuring [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Bell was hired as a [[technical advisor]] for the long-running, popular television show, ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The concept for Woodsy Owl was developed on the set of ''Lassie''.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Bell teamed with three other Lassie teachnical advisors -  United States Forest Service rangers, Chuck Williams and Glenn Kovar, and colleague Betty Hite - to create Woodsy Owl as the new mascot for the [[United States Forest Service]] for the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

The United States Forest Service had requested that Bell and the others develop a new message and symbol for the agency.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; A number of other animals were considered as the mascot, including a [[ladybug]], [[rainbow trout]], [[elk]] and [[raccoon]]. An [[owl]] was ultimately chosen because of the belief that owls are wise, can see polluters from treetop perches, and can live near cities and towns.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Bell and the others envisioned Woodsy Owl with a broad mission, unlike Smokey Bear, who focused almost exclusively on [[forest fire]] prevention.  The owl would be used to advocate environmental programs and urge American children to fight pollution and help the environment.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Woodsy Owl became most famous for his motto, ''Give a hoot, Don’t pollute''.  As of 2009, the character now uses the [[slogan]], ''Help Woodsy Spread the Word'', mixed with the song, ''[[The Syncopated Clock]]'', by [[Leroy Anderson]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

'''Harold David Caro'''  {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE}} (1 September 1887 – 10 June 1964) was the 23rd mayor of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton, New Zealand]] and a Hamilton businessman. He was awarded the OBE in 1950. 

==Biography==
He was born in Christchurch to Mrs Lewis Cato. He was educated in Parnell, Auckland and was employed by P Hayman of Auckland. Then he was a partner in Caro Bros, Auckland from 1910 to 1923. In 1923 he founded Caros GBS or Great Bargain Stores in Hamilton. 

He was on the Hamilton Borough Council from 1931 to 1953, and was Mayor of Hamilton from 1938 to 1953, when he was defeated. He was chairman of the Waikato Hospital Board from 1948 to 1953, and chairman of the Waikato Patriotic Fund Board from 1939 to 1954. He was re-elected to the Hamilton City Council in 1959. 

Caro contested the seat of [[Hamilton (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton]] at the [[New Zealand general election, 1935|1935 general election]] for the anti-Labour [[New Zealand Democrat Party (1934)|Democrat Party]], polling third with 20% of the vote.&lt;ref name="1935 election"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Zealand Official Year-Book |year=1936 |publisher=Government Printer |url=http://www3.stats.govt.nz/New_Zealand_Official_Yearbooks/1936/NZOYB_1936.html#idsect1_1_322199 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501063847/http://www3.stats.govt.nz/New_Zealand_Official_Yearbooks/1936/NZOYB_1936.html#idsect1_1_322199 |archivedate=1 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrat Candidate |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19350918.2.33.10 |accessdate=13 March 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXXII |issue=22217 |date=18 September 1935 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Henri Wilhelm August Deterding''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE (Hon)]], (19 April 1866, [[Amsterdam]]&amp;nbsp;– 4 February 1939, [[St. Moritz]]) was one of the first executives of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and its chairman for 36 years (1900–1936), and then chair of the combined [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch/Shell]] oil company. He became manager after Royal Dutch's founder [[Jean Baptiste August Kessler]] died. He made Shell a competitor to [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]] and one of the world's largest [[petroleum]] companies. He was made an honorary [[Order of British Empire|KBE]] in 1920, for service to [[Anglo-Dutch relations]], and for his work supplying [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] with petroleum during [[World War I]].
==Career==
[[File:Shell merger telegram.jpg|left|thumb|Message to [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|Marcus Samuel]] from Deterding on the Royal Dutch Shell merger in 1907]]
Called the "Napoleon of Oil", Deterding was responsible for developing the tanker fleet that let Royal Dutch compete with the Shell company of [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|Marcus Samuel]].  He led Royal Dutch to several major mergers and acquisitions, including the merger with Samuel's "Shell" Transport and Trading Company in 1907 and the purchase of [[Azerbaijan]] oil fields from the [[Rothschild family]] in 1911.  In the last years of his life, Deterding was controversial when he became an admirer of the [[Nazism|German]] [[Nazi Party]]. In 1936, he discussed with them the sale of a year's [[oil reserves]] on credit; the next year, he was forced to resign from the company's board.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Royal Dutch by Frederik Carel Gerretson&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he bought the manor of Dobbin near [[Krakow am See]] (Germany) and moved there. After he died in [[Switzerland]] he was buried at Dobbin in [[Mecklenburg]],&lt;ref&gt;http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2010/11/06/royal-dutch-shell-nazi-secrets-part-1-the-funeral/&lt;/ref&gt; but his body was transferred to a grave in [[Liechtenstein]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Angelika Schmiegelow-Powell, "Güstrow im Umbruch", Edition Temmen 2003 {{ISBN|3-86108-392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Deterding was married three times (resp. to Catharina Neubronner,&lt;ref name="Hendrix2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Hendrix|title=Sir Henri Deterding and Royal Dutch-Shell: Changing Control of World Oil, 1900-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRi1AAAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Bristol Academic|isbn=978-0-9513762-8-7|pages=32–|quote= In 1894 Deterding had married Catharina Neubronner; she was a strong-willed woman who probably resembled his own mother. If so, this may explain why it became such ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydia Koudoyaroff and to Charlotte Knaack who belonged to [[Nazi Party]]) and had seven children, among whom was the socialite [[Olga Deterding]]. During his marriage to his second wife, his English estate was [[Buckhurst Park, Berkshire|Buckhurst Park]] at [[Winkfield]] in [[Berkshire]], where she continued to live with her two daughters after their divorce.

The British newspaper the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' erroneously published his obituary on 27 June 1924, with the news being copied by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 28 June 1924, p.15. [https://www.nytimes.com/1924/06/28/archives/henry-deterding-dies-at-film-show-director-general-of-the-royal.html "Henry Deterding dies at film show; Director General of the Royal Dutch Company Succumbs Suddenly in The Hague."]. Last checked on 27 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, that same day, the Dutch envoy in London [[René de Marees van Swinderen]] noted in a letter to the Dutch foreign minister [[Herman Adriaan van Karnebeek]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"P.S. Ik kon de verleiding niet weerstaan om hierbij in te sluiten de necrologie door de ''Daily Mail'' heden gewijd aan den gelukkig springlevenden Deterding."&lt;br /&gt;

I could not resist adding hereby the obituary dedicated by the ''Daily Mail'' to Deterding, who is fortunately very much alive.")&lt;ref&gt;Documenten betreffende de buitenlandse politiek van Nederland 1919–1945 Deel V 1923–1924, Rijks Geschiedkundige Publicatiën Grote Serie 192, 's-Gravenhage 1985 (Documents concerning foreign policy of the Netherlands 1919–1945 Part V 1923–1924, National Historical Publications Grote Series no. 192, The Hague 1985); Document no. 284, page 552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deterding died in [[St. Moritz]] on 4 February 1939.

'''Hercules Crosse Jarvis''' (18 June 1802 – 8 February 1889) MLC, MLA, was a [[mayor of Cape Town]] and a powerful merchant of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Kent Rasmussen: Dictionary of African historical biography. University of California Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-520-06611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Born in [[Plymouth]], England on 18 June 1802,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamson.co.za/family/tree/HerculesCrosseJARVIS_baptism.jpg|title=Baptism recorded on 29 August 1802 at St George the Martyr church, Holborn (image)|website=williamson.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a close relative of [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent]], the admiral who fought Napoleon. His father, also named John Jervis, was an [[army captain]] from [[Staffordshire]] who died young, leaving his wife and six children. 
Coming from an intensely military family, the 14-year-old Hercules Crosse was offered a commission in the army by his relative the [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral of St Vincent]], but he had other plans and turned the offer down. He was also of a very gentle and sensitive nature, and the idea of war deeply repelled him.

After briefly visiting the [[British Cape Colony|Cape]] in 1816, he decided to move to the colony permanently, and arrived in [[Cape Town]] in 1821 with the intention of settling and making his fortune.

==Early life in Cape Town==
Soon after moving to Cape Town, he found a job as a clerk in the trading firm ''Hudson, Donaldson &amp; Dixon'' and worked his way up to being its manager - a position he held throughout his life until he retired from business in 1864. 
He was enormously influential in starting and developing the Cape's wine exports, and founded a distillery for that purpose in the vicinity of [[Paarl]]. He came to have a presence in many of the Cape's institutions, including directorship in Mutual Life (1846), the Union Bank (1847), the Harbour Board and even the [[South African College]] (1860). He was also a veteran member of the Cape Town Commercial Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Encyclopedia of Southern Africa''. Vol. 6. Nasou Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Jarvis married an [[Afrikaner|Afrikaans]] woman, Elizabeth Maria Vos, joining the local [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (where he was later made an Elder) in order to do so. He was aged 19 at the time, and she was only 16. They had five daughters. One of them, Elizabeth Maria, met and married the young [[John Charles Molteno]], who was later to become the Cape's first Prime Minister. Another daughter, Elizabeth Magdalena Christina ("Betty") married the [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]] Mayor [[James Bisset (mayor)|James Bisset]] and was mother to the Governor and cricketer [[Murray Bisset|Sir Murray Bisset]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Jenkins, C. (1996) ''World Cricketers: A Biographical Dictionary'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-210005-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A third daughter, Sophia St Ives married the influential Cape businessman and exporter [[Percy John Allport]]. Anne Jarvis married the widower and Indian army officer Major William Bazett Gordon Blenkins C.B. The youngest daughter Emmie never married.

==Political career==
[[File:Cape Town - Speeches on the Convict Crisis by T Bowler1849 Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A 19th Century depiction of the speeches and public debates on the Convict Crisis in Cape Town, 1849]]

Hercules Crosse became a prominent fighter for the establishment of a representative [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape parliament]], and when it was finally created he took a seat as the first minister to stand for Cape Town. In addition, the city of Cape Town was set up with a ''Board of Commissioners'' (later, ''Municipal Council'') in 1840 and Jarvis was immediately elected onto it, soon becoming its chairman. He had particularly good relations with the [[Cape Malay]] community of Cape Town, and throughout his political career he derived a good deal of his political support from this important voting bloc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/places/villages/westernCape/capetown/index.php?id=9&amp;page=3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moltenofamily.net/biographies/|title=Biographies|work=Molteno Family History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to become [[Mayor of Cape Town|mayor and first citizen of Cape Town]] from 1848 to 1861, making him the longest serving of any first citizen of Cape Town. 
As mayor, Jarvis was responsible for much of the early development of Cape Town's infrastructure. He drew up the plans for the city's first breakwater and harbour, and was a member of the Harbour Board for forty years. 

He was an impartial and influential spokesman of the city during the Anti-Convict Movement (1848-1850), holding public meetings and presiding over debates. This local movement had developed in response to an attempt by the British government to turn the Cape Colony into a [[penal colony]]. In the end, it was Jarvis' resolutions on the matter that ended up being conveyed to the Governor and the Queen. He subsequently suggested a renaming of a portion of the Heerengracht to "[[Adderley Street]]" - now the central street of the Cape Town CBD - after the man who had championed the opinion of the Cape citizens in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;RFM Immelman: ''Men of Good Hope, 1804-1954''. CTCC: Cape Town, 1955. Chapter 6 ''The Anti-convict Agitation''. p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s he joined the growing movement for [[Responsible government]] that was led by his son-in-law [[John Molteno]].&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Molteno: The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}
==Later life==
The Cape's economy was in a severely depressed state in the 1860s, and Jarvis's vast business interests were one of the many victims of this economic stagnation. Once the leading wine merchant in the country, he eventually declared bankruptcy in 1864 and, already elderly, never completely recovered financially, even in the country's 1870s economic boom. He sold his Somerset Road house and moved in with the extended family of his son-in-law John Molteno, in Claremont. 
In later life, he took an avid interest in mining. He unsuccessfully prospected for coal in the Cape Town [[City Bowl]] area, before setting up a [[Manganese]] mining venture outside [[Paarl]].

He died at the house of his daughter Sophia St Ives Mary Alport, in [[Claremont, Cape Town]], in 1889 and was buried beside his wife at Claremont St. Saviours Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=61337|title=JARVIS Hercules Crosse 1803-1889|work=eggsa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the Dutch airforce and became an [[aviator|airforce pilot]]. After his service he briefly worked with a radio division of the Dutch postal services and obtained his commercial aviation licence. Together with [[Martin Schröder (Martinair)|Martin Schröder]] he founded Martinair. They introduced leisure travel by plane in the Netherlands. Block left the company in 1965 and shortly after bought the 'sleeping' airline Transavia Limburg which he renamed to Transavia. he built up the airline from scratch and ten years later Transavia had a marketshare of 45% of the Dutch holiday market. After a quarrel with some investors Block left Transavia in 1975.
He went on and founded the small company Jetstar Holland BV in 1977. As such he introduced the use of executive jet travel in the Netherlands. He sold the company soon after to an investment holding and went back to the larger scheme: in 1984 he founded the airline Air Holland that went public in 1989.
Block left Air Holland in 1991 and died in 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">'''Jonathan-Raphaël Bischoffsheim''' (26 April 1808 – 5 February 1883) was a Belgian banker, businessman and philanthropist. 

==Family==
He descended from the [[Bischoffsheim family]], which was endowed with an exceptional European network. On 11 June 1832, he married Henriette [[Goldschmidt family|Goldschmidt]] (1812–1892) in Brussels, and together they had four children: [[Clara de Hirsch|Claire]] (1833–1899), Regine (1834–?), [[Ferdinand Bischoffsheim|Ferdinand Raphaël]] (1837–1909), and Hortense Henriette (1843–1901).

==Career==
In 1827, he co-founded the bank of ''Bischoffsheim &amp; Goldschmidt''. He played an important role for the finances and the institutions during the early years of Belgian independence. Bisschoffsheim was a Director of the ''Banque de Belgique'' and was one of the founders of the [[National Bank of Belgium]], the regional tramways and managed the Communal Credit (Dutch: ''Gemeentekrediet''; French: ''Credit Communal'') and the ''Caisse Generale d'Epargne et de Retraite'' (CGER or ASLK).

Together with his brother [[Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim]] (1800–1873), he founded the bank which eventually developed into [[Paribas]] bank. From 1862 until 1883, he was also a Liberal member of the Belgian Parliament, and as such was influential in the development of the public education network.

In 1962, she met Elaine Silverstein,&lt;ref name=SunSentinel/&gt; with whom she would co-found Beber Silverstein &amp; Partners ten years later, at a time when women headed few agencies, investing $7,000 into the business.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; With two children in elementary school and no prior plans to start a career, Beber decided to go into the advertising business after hearing a speech in 1971 by [[Gloria Steinem]] about women's rights.&lt;ref name=SunSentinel/&gt; She got some training from a cousin who owned an advertising agency and started the firm in 1972, where their first client was the [[American Jewish Committee]].&lt;ref name=SunSentinel/&gt;

The firm won many  accounts, including [[Florida Power &amp; Light]], the [[National Education Association]], [[Humana]], [[Steinway &amp; Sons]], [[Paramount Pictures]], the [[National Organization for Women]] and [[Knight-Ridder]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The firm also did iconic (and controversial) campaigns for the [[State of Florida]], with the slogan "Florida. The rules are different here." being interpreted as encouraging lawbreaking. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} She also developed tourism campaigns for [[Miami]] that said "Miami. See It Like a Native", a poster of a woman from behind wearing only snorkeling gear and a bathing suit bottom, and acampaign that used the slogan "Miami's For Me".&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt; The firm's annual billings reached $100 million.&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;

The agency did work for the Helmsley Hotel group, and was hired — and fired — by hotelier [[Leona Helmsley]] on four separate occasions. Beber had to file suit on three occasions to get paid. In one of the firm's first meetings with Helmsley, Beber's conversation was interrupted by a call Mrs. Helmsley took from a hotel guest who had been dissatisfied with a noisy air conditioning unit, and they spoke about Helmsley's frustration with the inadequate quality of the towels the hotel provided.&lt;ref&gt;Kanner, Bernice.

Accessed September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Beber used the conversation as the impetus to develop a campaign for Helmsley that featured her as "Queen of the Palace", carefully watching over every detail at the Harley Hotel in [[Manhattan]]. Occupancy shot up from 25% to 87% after just four months, and the campaign was recognized by ''[[Adweek]]'' magazine as opening "a new chapter in U.S. hotel advertising".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; and billing the [[The New York Palace Hotel|Helmsley Palace Hotel]] as "The only Palace in the world where the Queen stands guard".&lt;ref&gt;Kasindorf, Jeanie.

Accessed September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Helmsley fired Beber  four different times: once,  in order to handle advertising internally; again after Beber added [[Donald Trump]] as a client; next, when she blamed Beber's ad campaign for raising her profile leading to her tax evasion conviction; finally, when Helmsley found out that a man to whom Beber had introduced her (and in whom Helmsley had been romantically interested) turned out to be gay.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; After one {{which|date=December 2010}} of the firings, Helmsley told an interviewer that "You could say I gave her the royal flush".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; When the firm was rehired after Helmsley's income tax evasion conviction, Beber developed the slogan "Say what you will, she runs a helluva hotel."&lt;ref name=SunSentinel/&gt;

Beber suffered a stroke in 2003,&lt;ref name=SunSentinel/&gt; and died in Miami at age 80 on September 17, 2010 of [[leukemia]].&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt; She was survived by her husband,  two daughters and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Her daughter Jennifer joined the firm in 1988, later becoming its president.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">'''Justo Daract''' (1804–1887) was an Argentine politician who served as governor of [[San Luis Province]] and in the [[Argentine Senate]] and [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]], representing that province.

==Life and times==
Son of a [[French Argentine]] immigrant, Daract was born in [[San Luis, Argentina]], studied in [[Buenos Aires]], and became a retailer. The alliance in 1840 of [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]] and five smaller, northwestern provinces in a [[Argentine Civil Wars|Northern Coalition]] against [[Buenos Aires Province]] Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] (the paramount figure in the [[Argentine Confederation]]) prompted Daract to join the [[Unitarian Party]]. Following the coalition's defeat in November, however, Daract fled to [[Chile]], and reopened his former Buenos Aires business there. He received financial support from the governor of [[San Luis Province]], [[Pablo Lucero]], and stockpiled arms for an eventual return.

He returned to Argentina in 1850, and purchased a [[cattle ranch]] in San Luis Province, becoming an important supplier for the Army. He was named [[Civil Court]] magistrate in 1853, though by then, he had distanced himself from Governor Lucero, and led an alliance of both Unitarians and their enemies, the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]], against the governor. The alliance succeeded in persuading Lucero to step down, and on November 8, 1854, Daract was selected governor by an assembly. He enacted a new provincial constitution, and promptly called for elections. Daract won in the polls later that year, and became the first elected governor of San Luis. 

The governor enacted numerous reforms during his tenure. He established a [[judicial system]], subdivided the province into eight departments, established a system of [[public land]] [[lease]]s over vast tracts of provincially owned [[pasture]]s, founded the first newspaper in San Luis, regulated native American commerce, founded a strategically located [[fort]] (at what today is [[Villa Mercedes, San Luis|Villa Mercedes]]), and had a variety of infrastructure built in the pastoral province, as well as commissioning what became the Cathedral of San Luis (notable for its [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] portico). Serving out his term, he stepped down in 1859, and was succeeded by General [[Juan Esteban Pedernera]].

A series of disorders caused by the Federalist defeat at the [[Battle of Pavón]] led to Daract's re-appointment as governor by an assembly and with the support of Buenos Aires, in December 1861. Serving for five months, he mediated a truce between Unitarian general [[Wenceslao Paunero]] and [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] governor [[Chacho Peñaloza]], who had invaded San Luis Province amid a renewed conflict with Unitarians; the truce resulted in the Treaty of La Banderita, which contributed to national stability by dissipating conflict in the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] (western) region of Argentina.

Daract was elected to the [[Argentine Senate]] in 1863. He advocated for provincial [[autonomy]] and negotiated a truce between the national government and the [[Ranquel]] people that inhabited the San Luis area. He was elected to the Provincial Legislature, and in April 1865, to a third term as governor. A Federalist uprising in November 1866 forced Daract and his government to evacuate San Luis. Argentine Army troops, led by General [[José Miguel Arredondo]], retook San Luis in the April, 1867, Battle of San Ignacio, however, and Daract regained his post.

The intervention made Daract a staunch supporter of the President, [[Bartolomé Mitre]], and he was elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Lower House of Congress]] on Mitre's Liberal Party ticket, shortly after his May 1867 retirement as governor. He was a [[constitutional assembly]]man during a number of amendment deliberations, and established the San Luis National College, and the Girls' [[Normal School]] in that province. 

Daract died in [[Villa María]], Córdoba, in 1887. The town of [[Justo Daract, San Luis]] was named in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">'''Jørgen Blydt''' (14 March 1868 – 28 April 1938) was a Norwegian businessperson and politician for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]]. He ran for parliamentary election in all four of [[Bergen]] county's constituencies at the time—[[Kalfaret]], [[Nordnes]], [[Sandviken]] and [[Nygård, Norway|Nygaard]]—and served two terms as an [[Parliament of Norway|MP]] (1900–1903 and 1916–1918). He ran a company with his brother-in-law, was a stock exchange commissary, and from 1932 to 1938 he was the Chancellor of the [[Order of St. Olav|Order Council]].

==Career==
He was born in [[Bergen]] as a son of merchant Hans Schultz Blydt (1830–1916) and Maren Breder Hagelsteen (1834–1870). He finished [[Bergen Commerce School]] before taking education in France, England and Belgium between 1886 and 1889. He took over his father's company which traded in fishing and angling tools in 1891, and ran it together with his brother-in-law Hjalmar Grung as ''Blydt &amp; Grung''. He retired in 1929. From 1912 he was also a commissary for [[Bergen Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=storting&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10356|title=Jørgen Blydt|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of Bergen city council, and was first elected to the [[Parliament of Norway]] in [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1899|1899]] from the plural-member constituency Bergen.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1906|1906]] he ran in the single-member constituency [[Kalfaret]], and was elected deputy as the running mate of [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. The race was unusually close, with Mowinckel/Blydt edging out [[Johan Lothe|Lothe]]/[[Klaus Hanssen|Hanssen]] of the [[Coalition Party (Norway)|Coalition Party]] with 932 against 914 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{stort06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1909|1909]] Blydt ran in [[Nordnes]], but finished third behind [[Fredrik Ludvig Konow|Konow]] and [[Kristian Hopp|Hopp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{stort09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1912|1912]] Blydt ran in [[Sandviken]], and finished second behind Labour's [[Lars Sæbø]].&lt;ref&gt;{{stort12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1915|1915 parliamentary election]], Blydt ran in the last of Bergen's four constituencies, [[Nygård, Norway|Nygaard]], in the first round. He finished second (with 2,446 votes) behind Labour's [[S. K. Tjønneland]] (2,563 votes) but ahead of Conservative [[Henrik Ameln]] (2,056 votes). A runoff vote had to be held. However, both Blydt and Tjønneland were pulled from the race. The reason was that Blydt had run in Sandviken as well, and though finishing second behind Lars Sæbø again, he managed to reach the runoff here. In this runoff, Blydt won the seat with 3,836 votes against Sæbø's 3,429.&lt;ref&gt;{{stort15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus served a second term as an MP, and like fifteen years prior, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Trade.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

Particularly during the First World War he was a member of numerous committees that sprang up as the state needed more control over enterprise. He chaired one of these committees, the Coal Provisioning Committee of 1917. He chaired Bergen Commercial Association for five years, and Bergen Chamber of Commerce from 1915 to 1926. Nationally, he was a board member of [[Norges Handelsstands Forbund|Den Norske Handelsstands Fællesforening]] from 1909 to 1916, and he was also a council member of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. He was a board member of [[Bergens Kreditbank]] (1906–1922), [[Fiskeribanken]] (1921–1936), [[Norges Eksportråd|Norges Oplysningskontor for Næringsveiene]] and the [[Norwegian America Line]]. He was a council member of the [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] and a supervisory committee member of the [[Bergen Line]].&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

In culture, he was a board member of [[Den Nationale Scene]] from 1913 to 1931, chairing it for the last two years. He was a member of the Order Council, which rewards the [[Order of St. Olav]], from 1925, and served as vice chancellor in 1931 and chancellor from 1932 to his death in 1938.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=70 år|date=14 March 1938|work=Aftenposten|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dødsfall|date=29 April 1938|work=Aftenposten|page=11|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Natural resource economics}}
{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}
In [[economics]], '''land''' comprises all [[natural resource|naturally occurring resources]] as well as geographic [[land]]. Examples include particular [[geographical location]]s, [[mineral deposit]]s, forests, fish stocks, atmospheric quality, [[geostationary orbit]]s, and portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Supply of these resources is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/land-economics|title=Land - economics|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Natural resources are fundamental to the [[Production theory basics|production]] of all [[good (economics)|goods]], including [[capital goods]]. Location values are not be confused with values imparted by fixed capital improvements. In [[classical economics]], land is considered one of the three [[factors of production]] (also sometimes called the three producer goods) along with [[capital (economics)|capital]], and [[labor (economics)|labor]]. Land is sometimes merged with capital to simplify micro-economics. However, a common mistake is combining land and capital in macro-analysis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Land was sometimes defined in classical and [[neoclassical economics]] as the "original and indestructible powers of the soil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2097629|title=Economic Aspects of Urban Land Use Patterns|first=Ernest M.|last=Fisher|date=17 May 2018|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Industrial Economics|volume=6|issue=3|pages=198–208|doi=10.2307/2097629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=January 2018}}

==Ownership and rent==
Income derived from ownership or control of [[natural resources]] is referred to as [[economic rent|rent]].

===Georgism===
[[Georgism|Georgists]] hold that this implies a perfectly [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] [[supply curve]] (i.e., zero elasticity), suggesting that a [[land value tax]] that recovers the [[Economic rent#Land rent|rent of land]] for public purposes would not affect the [[opportunity cost]] of using land, but would instead only decrease the value of owning it.  This view is supported by evidence that although land can come on and off the market, market inventories of land show if anything an inverse relationship to price (i.e., negative elasticity).

===Accounting===
As a tangible [[asset]] land is represented in accounting as a [[fixed asset]] or a [[capital asset]].

===Conflict===
Land, particularly geographic locations and mineral deposits, has historically been the cause of much conflict and dispute; [[land reform]] programs, which are designed to redistribute possession and/or use of geographic land, are often the cause of much controversy, and conflicts over the economic rent of mineral deposits have contributed to many civil wars.

==Academic==
Some United Kingdom and common wealth universities offer a courses in ''land economy'', where economics is studied alongside law, business regulation, surveying and the built and natural environments.&lt;ref name="cam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergradstudy/prospectus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912080021/http://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergradstudy/prospectus.htm |archivedate=2009-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/degree-programmes/286/rural-surveying-and-rural-property-management/|title=Land Economy - Rural Surveying - Postgraduate Taught Degrees - Study Here - The University of Aberdeen|author=|date=|website=www.abdn.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/organisation/commonwealth-association-surveying-and-land-economy-casle|title=Commonwealth Association of Surveying and Land Economy (CASLE) - The Commonwealth|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This mode of study at Cambridge dates back to 1917 when [[William Cecil Dampier]] suggested the creation of a school of rural economy at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/about-us/a-brief-history-of-land-economy|title=A brief history of Land Economy — Department of Land Economy|first=|last=pjm93@cam.ac.uk|date=|website=www.landecon.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32474">The '''Organic law  15/1999 of December 13 about protection of Personal Data''', ('''LOPD'''), is an [[organic law]] [[Spain|Spanish]] that guarantees and protects the processing of personal data, public liberties and [[fundamental human rights]], and especially of their personal and family [[honor]] and [[privacy]].  It was approved by the [[Cortes Generales|General Court]] on December 13, 1999. This law is developed based on Article 18 of the [[Spanish Constitution | Spanish Constitution of 1978]], on familiar and personal[[right to privacy]] and the secrecy of communications.

Its main objective is to regulate the treatment of data and files, of a personal nature, regardless of the support in which they are treated, the rights of citizens over them and the obligations of those who create or treat them. This law affects all data that refers to registered humans on any support, computer or otherwise. Excluded from this regulation are those data collected for domestic use, classified materials of the state and those files that collect data on Terrorism and other forms of [[organized crime]] (not simple delinquency).

Based on this law, the Spanish Agency for Data Protection was created, at the state level, which ensures compliance with this Law.

== Regulatory development ==
* The Royal Decree 994/1999 on Security Measures for automated files that containing personal data of June 11, 1999 (RMS): It is a regulation that develops the Organic Law 5/1992, of October 29, of Regulation of the Automated Treatment of Personal Data (LORTAD), regulates the technical and organizational measures that must be applied to the information systems in which personal data are processed in an automated way. (Repealed since April 19 of 2010)
* The Royal Decree 1720/2007, of December 21 on the development of the Organic Law on Data Protection. It is a development of the Organic Law 15/99 of Data Protection of December 13; develops the principles of the law, and the security measures to be applied in the information systems. It applies to files in automated support, as in any other type of media.

== Control bodies and possible sanctions ==
The body responsible for monitoring compliance with data protection regulations at Spanish territory, in general, is the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD), 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agpd.es/portalweb/index-ides-idphp.php Spanish Agency for Data Protection]&lt;/ref&gt; there are other Data Protection Agencies of an autonomous nature, in [[Autonomous Communities]] of [[Catalonia]] and in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

The sanctions are divided into three groups depending on the seriousness of the act committed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelparra.com/empresas-multadas/ List of companies sanctioned in 2009] List of companies that are being sanctioned during the year 2009, indicating the amount imposed and the date. It also reflects the "Top 3" of the most sanctioned companies during this period, total amount in euros of all sanctions and other statistical information&lt;/ref&gt; Spain being the country of the European Union that has the highest sanctions in terms of protection of data. These sanctions depend on the violation committed. The last company sanctioned has been the company Grupon, sanctioned by the state data protection agency, with 20&amp;nbsp;000 euros  for storing the CVV codes of the Credit cards from their customers without informing them.

They are divided into:

{{cita|
The minor penalties range from 900 to 40&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;€

Serious penalti range from 40&amp;nbsp;001 a 300&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;€

Very serious penalties range from 300&amp;nbsp;001 a 600&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;€
}}

Despite the amount of sanctions, there are many [[companies]] in [[Spain]] that have not yet adapted to it, or have done so in a partial manner or do not periodically review its adequacy; so that, maintenance and review of the adequacy carried out is essential.

In the public sector, the mentioned Law also regulates the use and management of information and files with personal data used by all public administrations.

The Spanish Agency for Data Protection ([[AEPD]]) was created in 1994 in accordance with the provisions of the repealed LORTAD. Its headquarters are located in Madrid, although the Autonomous Communities of Madrid, the Basque Country and Catalonia have created their own autonomous Agencies.

== Inspection and guardianship of Rights Procedures ==

=== Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) ===

==== [http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/revista_prensa/revista_prensa/2013/notas_prensa/common/octubre/132910_NP_Memoria_2012.pdf Year 2012] ====
In 2012 complaints filed with the [[Agency for data protection|AEPD]], increased by 12%. The activity of the Agency has grown significantly in 2012, with an increase of 15% in the files registered and almost 40% in the resolutions issued. The allegations of identity theft, especially in the supply and commercialization of energy and water (222%) and in telecommunications (92%), have experienced a substantial increase. Of the 863 infringement decisions declared to private managers, more than 34% concluded in a warning, without imposing a penalty. On the other hand, most of the sanctions affect the telecommunications sector, which represents 73% of the total. Three of the main operators accumulate 70.94% of the total amount of fines.

==== [http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/canaldocumentacion/memorias/memoria_2011/common/Memoria_2011.pdf Year 2011] ====
In 2011, reported complaints were 51.6% higher than those filed in 2010. This increase is also reflected in the increase in declaratory resolutions of infringement of 37.7%. However, the application of the figure of the warning has determined a decrease of 14.5% in the declared economic sanctions. The sector where sanctions have increased most (64%) and have been declared to a greater extent (25.5%) and amount, (63%) is that of telecommunications. The amount of sanctions has grown by 12% compared to 2010.

==== Year 2009 ====
In 2009 they increased by more than 75% of the complaints received, which reached the figure of 4,136, and the number of requests for protection of rights, by 58%. 709 sanctioning procedures were resolved, of which 621 ended with sanction with a total amount of 24.8 million euros.

[[AEPD]] resolved in 2008 a total of 630 sanctioning procedures, almost 58% more than in 2007, of which 535 culminated with the imposition of sanctions. The fines imposed amounted to 22.6 million euros, representing an increase of 15% over the previous year.

=== Autonomous data protection agencies ===

==== Year 2007 ====
The Data Protection Agency of the Community of Madrid carried out 196 inspection procedures and 32 procedures for the protection of rights in 2007.

The Basque Data Protection Agency-Datuak Babesteko Euskal Bulegoa (AVDP-DBEB), resolved 43 complaints and 18 infringement procedures in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avpd.euskadi.net%2Fs04-5249%2Fes%2Fcontenidos%2Finformacion%2Fmemorias_anuales%2Fes_mem2007%2Fadjuntos%2Fcifras.pdf&amp;images=yes Report of the basque agency 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ibero-American Data Protection Network ===

The Ibero-American Data Protection Network (RIPD), since its creation in 2003, has developed an intense and fruitful work, such as the organization of ten meetings. In addition to contributing to that more than 150 million Latin American citizens currently have, along with the traditional protection of [[habeas data]], rules that allow to effectively guarantee the use of their personal information and specialized authorities with powers to protect said guarantee.

In [[Latin America]] policies are being developed for the protection of personal data. In 2012 two new laws were approved. In [[Nicaragua]], Law No. 787 of Protection of Personal Data, of March 29, 2012 and Statutory Law No. 1581 of October 17, 2012, by which general provisions for the Protection of Personal Data are issued.

In [[Chile]], also Law 19.628, of August 28, 1999, on Protection of Private Life, is currently in the process of reviewing part of its articles.

The [[National Assembly of Venezuela]] is processing the bill for the Protection of Personal Data of Habeas Data. And in [[Costa Rica]] there is already a Data Protection Agency of the Republic of Costa Rica, in compliance with the law approved in 2011.

== Information Duty ==

Personal data are classified according to their greater or lesser degree of sensitivity, being the legal requirements and computer security measures more stringent in terms of this greater degree of sensitivity, being mandatory on the other hand, in any case the declaration of the data protection files to the "Spanish Agency for Data Protection".

Interested parties to which personal data are requested must be previously informed in an express, precise and unambiguous way:

1. The existence of a file or treatment of personal data, the purpose of the collection of these and the recipients of the information.

2. Of the obligatory or optional character of his answer to the questions that are posed to them.

3. The consequences of obtaining the data or the refusal to supply them.

4. Of the possibility of exercising rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition.

5. The identity and address of the person responsible for the treatment or, if applicable, his representative.

However, the processing of personal data without having been collected directly from the affected party or interested party is permitted, although it is not exempted from the obligation to report expressly, accurately and unequivocally, by the person responsible for the file or its representative, within of the three months following the start of data processing.

Exception: Communication in three months of such information will not be necessary if the data has been collected from "sources accessible to the public",&lt;ref&gt;defined as those "files whose consultation can be carried out, by any person, not prevented by a rule limitative or without further requirement that, where appropriate, the payment of a consideration "and" are considered as sources of public access, exclusively, the promotional census, telephone directories (...) and lists of persons belonging to groups of professionals (...) Also, the newspapers and official bulletins and the media have the character of public access sources ". "In each communication addressed to the interested party will be informed of the origin of the data and the identity of the person responsible for the treatment, as well as the rights that assist".&lt;/ref&gt; and are intended for advertising or commercial prospecting , in this case "in each communication addressed to the interested party, he will be informed of the origin of the data and the identity of the person responsible for the treatment, as well as the rights that assist him".

; Model clause

This could be a model clause of information / consent of rights protected by the LOPD:

{{cita | In compliance with the Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, Protection of Personal Data (LOPD), (replace by the name of the person responsible for the file), as the person in charge of the file, reports the following considerations:

The personal data that we request, will be incorporated into a file whose purpose is (describe the purpose).
The fields marked with an asterisk (or any other signal) are mandatory, being impossible to realize the expressed purpose if you do not provide this information.

You are also informed of the possibility of exercising the rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition, of your personal data in (substitute the address to exercise the rights).}}

; Data whose treatment is prohibited

* Those relating to "criminal or administrative infractions".
* Exception: They can only be included in files of the competent public administrations.

== Consent ==

=== Types of consent ===
A) Unmistakable consent

The treatment of personal data will require the unambiguous consent of the affected party, unless the law provides otherwise.

B) Tacit Consent

This will be the normal form of consent in cases where an express or express consent is not required in writing.

C) Express consent

Personal data referring to racial origin, health and sexual life may only be collected, processed and assigned when, for reasons of general interest, it is provided by a law or the person expressly consents.

D) Express and written consent

Express consent is required in writing from the affected party regarding data related to ideology, union affiliation, religion and beliefs and may only be transferred with express consent.&lt;ref&gt;«The files kept by political parties, trade unions, churches are excepted , confessions or religious communities and associations, foundations and other non-profit entities, whose purpose is political, philosophical, religious or union, in terms of data relating to its members or members (... and) for the prevention or for the medical diagnosis, the provision of health care or medical treatment or the management of health services (... and) to safeguard the vital interest of the affected person or of another person, in the event that the affected person is physically or legally incapable of giving your consent. »&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data communication ==

They have responsibility in the communication and treatment of data not only the [[legal persons]] ([[companies]]) but also freelancers, freelancers, associations, collectives and people who own a [[blog]] (bloggers) through from which data from third parties are collected to make queries and for any other transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web
| url	= http://queesunpersonalshopper.com/asesoramiento-de-comunicacion/lopd/
 | title = LOPD and LSSI for SMEs, freelancers, associations and blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal data object of the treatment can only be communicated to a third party for the fulfillment of purposes directly related to the legitimate functions of the transferor and the transferee with the prior consent of the interested party.

The consent required in the previous section will not be precise:
# When the assignment is authorized by law.
# In the case of data collected from sources accessible to the public.
# When the treatment responds to the free and legitimate acceptance of a legal relationship whose development, compliance and control necessarily implies the connection of said treatment with third-party files. In this case the communication will only be legitimate as long as it is limited to the purpose that justifies it.
# When the communication to be made is addressed to the Ombudsman, the Public Prosecutor or the Judges or Courts or the Court of Accounts, in the exercise of the functions assigned to it. Neither will consent be required when the communication is addressed to autonomous institutions with analogous functions to the Ombudsman or the Court of Auditors.
# When the transfer occurs between Public Administrations and has as its objective the subsequent processing of the data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.
# When the transfer of personal data related to health is necessary to solve an emergency that requires access to a file or to perform epidemiological studies in the terms established in the legislation on state or regional health.

The consent for the communication of personal data to a third party will be void when the information provided to the interested party does not allow him to know the purpose to which the data will be destined whose communication is authorized or the type of activity of the person to whom it is sent. They intend to communicate.

The consent for the communication of personal data also has a revocable nature.

The one to whom the personal data are communicated is obliged, by the mere fact of the communication, to observe the provisions of this Law.

If the communication is made prior to the dissociation procedure, the provisions of the previous sections will not apply.

== Access to the data by third parties ==
# The access of a third party to the data will not be considered as data communication when said access is necessary for the provision of a service to the data controller.
# The performance of treatments on behalf of third parties must be regulated in a contract that must be recorded in writing or in some other form that allows proof of its conclusion and content, establishing expressly that the processor will only process the data according to the instructions of the person in charge of the treatment, which will not apply them or use them for purposes other than those stated in said contract, nor will they communicate them, even for their preservation, to other persons. &lt;br&gt; The contract will stipulate, in addition, the security measures to which refers to article 9 of this Law that the person in charge of the treatment is obliged to implement.
# Once the contractual provision has been fulfilled, the personal data must be destroyed or returned to the data controller, as well as any support or documents that contain any personal data object of the treatment.
# In the event that the person in charge of the treatment allocates the data for another purpose, communicates them or uses them in breach of the stipulations of the contract, it will also be considered responsible for the treatment, responding to the infractions that would have been incurred personally.

== Criticisms and main problems ==
Certain aspects of the law were declared unconstitutional in November 2000 and deleted from the current text.

It is considered that the increase in the creation of files and processing of personal data affects the right to protection of citizens' data; This concern was picked up by the European bodies that even ordered that January 28 be held annually on "[[European Data Protection Day]]". The celebration dates back to 2006, when the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe established the annual celebration of the Data Protection Day in Europe on January 28, commemorating the anniversary of the signing of [[Convention 108 of the Council of Europe for the protection of persons with regard to the automated processing of personal data]].

A very strict compliance with the regulation on data protection could slow down the normal work of a File Manager for the documentary accreditation of the information and consent principles of the LOPD; also in the opposite direction, a mere fulfillment of formal obligations, would leave the law senseless and the citizens unprotected and go against the "spirit" of the LOPD.

The possibility that companies can collect data without the consent of the affected has been criticized.

Certain resolutions of the AEPD &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agpd.es/portalweb/resoluciones/procedimientos_sancionadores/index-ides-idphp.php Some resolutions of the AEPD on its website]&lt;/ref&gt; have been reason for controversy:

* In October 2008, the [[Spanish Agency for Data Protection]] sanctioned the Popular Party ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]), then in opposition, with a fine of 60 &amp; nbsp; 101.21 euros for a serious infringement of the [[Organic Law of Protection of Personal Data]] consisting of the inclusion, without their consent, of four [[O Grove]] neighbors as "false volunteers" of the election lists of [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008100100_17_262785__Arousa-Proteccion-Datos-multa-falsos-voluntarios-listas-vascas Data Protection fine to the PP for the 'voluntary volunteers' of the Basque lists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.com/galicia/2008/10/01/0003_7186065.htm Data Protection fine to the PP for the "false volunteers" from the Basque lists]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The possibility offered by some websites to "send a friend" certain information, or "recommend this page to a friend" have also been sanctioned in strict application of the LOPD &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/485871/04/08/Ojo-al-enviar-datos-a-un-amigo-Proteccion-de-Datos-considera-que-es-sancionable.html Beware of sending data "to a friend! Protection of Data considers that it is punishable] "Recommend this page to a friend." If on your website this self-promotion formula appears, know that this option has the days counted, if you do not want to receive a fine. Data this practice violates the Law of Services of the Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI), which does not foresee that you can send any mail with advertising or promotional content, if it is reflected in a Resolution of the Agency, of February 20 of 2008, in which a webpage is fined for offering the internaut The ease of sending an informative message to the email address of a family member or friend inviting the recipient to register.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.error500.net/agencia-proteccion-datos-enviar-amigo The Agency of data protection against "send to a friend"] Stone remains one before the sanction of the Data Protection Agency to a website with the option of "send to a friend", that mechanism which many try to get their most convinced users invite their friends and family. The information is given, among others, The economist and on the website of the Data Protection Agency you can access the resolution (in PDF format).&lt;/ref&gt;
* La AEPD también resolvió que los datos relativos a los abortos practicados eran confidenciales, a raíz de la denuncias criminales interpuestas contra varias clínicas por presuntos abortos irregulares&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/politica/noticias/477254/04/08/La-Agencia-de-Proteccion-de-Datos-exige-respetar-la-confidencialidad-en-los-abortos.html «La Agencia de Protección de Datos exige respetar la confidencialidad en los abortos.»] La polémica en torno al aborto se desató a principios de este año. Las clínicas abortistas organizaron una huelga para protestar por las presiones recibidas por sus profesionales y por las investigaciones iniciadas en varios centros de Madrid y Barcelona por presuntos abortos irregulares... Por último, el documento establece que el acceso por parte de los órganos de inspección sanitaria será permitido cuando su finalidad sea la "comprobación de la calidad de la asistencia, el respeto de los derechos del paciente o cualquier otra obligación del centro en relación con los pacientes y usuarios o la propia Administración sanitaria".&lt;/ref&gt;
* The AEPD also resolved that the data regarding the abortions practiced were confidential, as a result of the criminal complaints filed against several clinics for alleged irregular abortions &lt;ref&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/politica/noticias/477254/04/08/La-Agencia-de-Proteccion-de-Datos-exige-respetar-la-confidencialidad-en-los-abortos.html «The Data Protection Agency demands to respect the confidentiality in abortions.»] The controversy about abortion was unleashed earlier this year. The abortion clinics organized a strike to protest the pressure received by their professionals and the investigations initiated in several centers in Madrid and Barcelona for alleged irregular abortions ... Finally, the document states that access by inspection bodies sanitary will be allowed when its purpose is "checking the quality of care, respect for the rights of the patient or any other obligation of the center in relation to patients and users or the health administration itself."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, a judgment of the Supreme Court declared that the "baptismal books" of the [[Catholic Church]] are not "data files", disavowing a resolution of October 20, 2006 issued by the Spanish Agency for the Protection of Data; the agency had given the reason to an apostate who requested that, through the Agency, his inscription in the Baptism Book be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derechoynormas.blogspot.com/2008/10/la-agencia-de-proteccin-de-datos-y-la.html «The Agency for Data Protection and apostasy.»] «Data Protection paralyzes the processing of apostasy requests. Frenazo for the more than half a thousand requests for apostasy that were to be resolved in the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD), and all those that may continue to arrive: The director of the AEPD, Artemi Rallo, announced yesterday that all these requests for cancellation of data in the baptismal books are suspended until new judicial decisions confirm or move away from the judgment of the Supreme Court last September, which, for the first time, exempted the ecclesiastical hierarchy from making a note of apostasy in the baptismal books. »(It has the sentence of the TS in PDF format)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to breaches of data protection legislation, several insurers and health centers have been sanctioned, since they exchanged medical information about patients without their express consent. However, they are subject to reduced sanctions for not being assessed "intentionality in the commission of the offense" &lt;ref&gt;[Data Protection, new fine to a health entity] That is why the AEPD imposes a fine of 60.101,27 euros for a very serious infraction, and another for the same amount and causes the plaintiff's doctor. Very serious faults are usually punishable by fines between 300&amp;nbsp;506and601&amp;nbsp;012 euros. In this case, the agency recognizes mitigating factors such as' there was no intentionality in the commission of the infringement, there is no recidivism, and the report was requested to avoid harm to the company, since the complainant had said that she was not suffering from venous insufficiency varicose veins when he had it.

Is a simple medical prescription with the name of a medicine a health fact, even if the specific disease is not reflected? Are the measurements of a person, such as the size of the foot, or for example the color of the eyes, considered health data? ...&lt;/ref&gt;
* AEPD sanctioned a company after a hacker attempted to blackmail it by finding a hole in its security and later denounced it &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumer.es/web/es/tecnologia/2008/03/17/175496.php "Data Protection fines Telefónica with 60,000 euros."] The agency considered the high level of computer knowledge of the complainant proved, as well as its lucrative spirit, which "bordered on the criminal offense and notoriety of a" pirate ", according to the content of the resolution, its opinion is supported by article 9 of the Organic Law of Protection of Personal Data that establishes the principle of" data security ", imposing the obligation to adopt the measures of technical and organizational nature that guarantee their security, with the purpose of avoiding the unauthorized access In any case, the fine imposed by the regulatory agency is of "minimum amount" because it maintains that there was no intention nalidad by Telefonica. However, the company has announced its intention to file an appeal against this resolution.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The LOPD continues to have gaps and social agents have requested certain reforms. In August 2008, [[Bernat Soria]], Socialist Minister of Health and Consumer Affairs stated that action would be taken to create a law against companies that were making commercial calls not consented to homes, usually at meal times, which was a behavior popularly known as "[[telephone spam]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltoday.com/index.php/actualidad/noticias/recibir-llamadas-publicitarias-no-solicitadas-en-el-limite-de-la-legislacion "Receive unsolicited advertising calls, within the limits of the legislation."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Cerco/telefonazos/basura/elpepusoc/20080815elpepisoc_2/Tes «Fence to the 'junk calls'.] The Government wants to end the unsolicited calls, with the annoying and increasingly frequent telephone spam, with ringing at the time of nap to the fixed or to the mobile to offer a change of operator, a new credit or an offer of connection to Int ernet, often produced from "private numbers" or "unknown" or local locutions or from abroad, which makes it impossible for the consumer to report it. The Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, Economy and Industry are working on a preliminary bill to transpose a European directive that considers this practice illegal. The Government expects to enter into force before the end of the year ... "Many are also produced at the time of siesta or at night, which makes them even more annoying," adds the head of Health and Consumption. Until now these practices were not regulated in a specific way. There is a law (of 2002) that prohibits unwanted email. ('' [[El Pais]] '', August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lutfi al-Haffar''' ({{lang-ar|لطفي الحفار}}{{ltr}}) (1891–1968) was a [[Syria]]n businessman and politician. He was a founding member of the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] and served as 11th [[List of Prime Ministers of Syria|Prime Minister of Syria]] in 1939.

==Early career==
Al-Haffar was born into the wealthy merchant [[Damascus|Damascene]] family of al-Haffar. His early career was mostly devoted to his family's business in trade. He joined the [[Damascus Chamber of Commerce]] in 1922, and became its deputy president in 1924. In 1923 in response to the water shortages in Damascus, al-Haffar established the [[Ayn al-Fijeh Waterworks Company]], which pumped water from the [[Ayn al-Fijeh]] spring in the [[Ghouta]] area to the city of Damascus and constructed the first modern public water system in the city. The project was an immediate success, and allowed the water from the [[Barada]] river to be used for other purposes like irrigation.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"&gt;{{cite book

==Political career==

===French mandate===
Al-Haffar's involvement in politics came through his alliance with nationalist leader [[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar]]. Shahbandar and Haffar founded the People's Party, which was the first political party in Syria under the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon|French Mandate]]. The party advocated the unity of [[Greater Syria]], and the abolition of the French Mandate.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt; The party was banned shortly thereafter by French authorities because of suspected links to the [[Great Syrian Revolt|1925 uprising]] in [[Jabal al-Druze]].&lt;ref name="Kédourie"&gt;{{cite book

Al-Haffar joined [[Ahmad Nami]]'s cabinet as minister of public works and economy in April 1926, but resigned two months later in protest of French interference. He was arrested by the mandate authorities and detained until 1928.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

====National Bloc====
In 1928 al-Haffar, along with a number of nationalist leaders, founded the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] in [[Beirut]]. The Bloc, under the leadership of [[Hashim al-Atassi]], became the central umbrella group for political resistance against the French occupation. Al-Haffar was elected to the national constitutional assembly in 1928, which was tasked with drafting Syria's first republican constitution.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

Al-Haffar was an active participant and organizer in the [[1936 Syrian general strike]]. The strike lasted sixty-days, and al-Haffar was arrested during a demonstration against the French-appointed prime minister, [[Taj al-Din al-Hasani]]. To end the protests, France invited the Bloc to Paris for negotiations which eventually resulted in the [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence]]. In July, parliamentary elections were held and the National Bloc was elected with an overwhelming majority. Al-Atassi was elected president, and [[Jamil Mardam Bey]] prime minister. Al-Haffar served as minister of finance in Mardam Bey's cabinet until July 1938.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

On 24 February 1939, al-Haffar was appointed prime minister by President al-Atassi. The cabinet, in which he also headed the education portfolio, lasted less than two months and was faced with a growing opposition under the leadership of al-Haffar's former ally, al-Shahbandar.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

In 1940 al-Shahbandar was assassinated and al-Haffar, along with three other leaders in the National Bloc, was tried before a French military tribunal. Al-Haffar escaped to [[Baghdad]], and remained there until he was acquitted by the courts. During the presidency of [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] between 1943 and 1946, al-Haffar served as minister of interior in three different cabinets under Prime Ministers [[Saadallah al-Jabiri]] and [[Faris al-Khoury]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

===Independence===
In 1947 the National Bloc split into two competing parties, the [[National Party (Syria)|National Party]] and the [[People's Party (Syria)|People's Party]]. Al-Haffar joined the National Party and became its secretary-general. He served as deputy to Prime Minister Mardam Bey until the [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état|military coup]] of Chief of Staff [[Husni al-Za'im]] overthrew the Quwatli administration. Al-Haffar was arrested along with most of Quwatli's allies. He was released after direct interference by former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Abdul Hamid Karami]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

== Later years ==
Lutfi al-Haffar's role in Syrian politics diminished in later years, and he held no official posts in the 1950s. He opposed the 1958 [[United Arab Republic|union]] between Egypt and Syria and signed the secession declaration supporting the military coup which ended the union in 1961. He retired from politics after the [[8 March Revolution|March 1963 Baath-led coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

'''Management accounting principles (MAP)''' were developed to serve the core needs of internal management to improve decision support objectives, internal business processes, resource application, customer value, and capacity utilization needed to achieve corporate goals in an optimal manner.  Another term often used for management accounting principles for these purposes is managerial costing principles.  The two [[management accounting]] principles are:  
# ''Principle of Causality'' (i.e., the need for cause and effect insights) and,
# ''Principle of Analogy'' (i.e., the application of causal insights by management in their activities).

These two principles serve the management accounting community and its customers – the management of businesses.  The above principles are incorporated into the Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF) along with concepts and constraints to help govern the management accounting practice.  The framework ends decades of confusion&lt;ref name=MAapproach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=A. van der Merwe|title=Management Accounting - Approaches, Techniques, And Management Processes|journal=Cost Management|date=May–Jun 2006|pages=14–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding management accounting approaches, tools and techniques and their capabilities.

The framework of principles, concepts, and constraints will drive the classification of management accounting practices in the profession to ''"enable a better understanding both inside the profession and outside, of the compromises that result from inappropriate principles"''.&lt;ref name="WhyWeNeed"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=G. Cokins|author3=J. Huntzinger|author4=K. Templin|author5=C. Thomas|author6=A. van der Merwe|author7= L.R. White|title=Why We Need A Conceptual Framework for Managerial Costing|journal=Strategic Finance|date=October 2011|pages=36–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without foundational principles, managers and accounting professionals have no consistent footing on which to challenge or evaluate new theories of methods for managerial costing.&lt;ref name=MCCF&gt;{{cite web|author=MCCF Task Force|title=Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF)|url=http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/CFMC%20Draft%20for%20Review.pdf|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants|date=July 2012|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some management accounting methods are designed primarily to serve and comply with [[financial accountancy]] guidelines.  The importance of having distinct and separate principles exclusively for Management Accounting has received support and acknowledgement after almost a century of work on the topic.   The idea that separate management accounting principles exist for managerial decision support distinct from financial reporting needs is now recognized by professional accounting bodies such as the [[International Federation of Accountants]] [http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/professional-accountants-business Professional Accountants In Business Committee] and the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] [http://www.imanet.org/resources_and_publications/ExposureDraft.aspx Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF) Task Force].

==Brief History==
Prior to 1929 no group – public or private – was issuing or responsible for any accounting&lt;ref name=Kieso&gt;{{cite book|last=Kieso|first=D.E.|title=Intermediate Accounting|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-71757-6|url=http://www.wiley.com|edition=11th, vol.I|author2=J.J. Weygandt|author3= T.D. Warfield|page=6|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  standards.  After the 1929 stock market crash, a call to regain the public's confidence and investor's trust was demanded and the [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] was passed resulting in public companies being supervised by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] [https://www.sec.gov/ (SEC)].  This set the groundwork for GAAP [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)]], outlining financial accounting principles for external reporting standards for users of financial statements' information such as capital markets and creditors.

Over the next 47 years many individual committees, professional bodies and boards released various financial accounting procedural frameworks until 1976 when work began on a US framework that remains in place today, governed by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB). &lt;br /&gt;
Note:  Since April 1, 2001 the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] has been working on developing new international financial reporting standards. The new standards, referred to as [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), aim to update and refine existing concepts and provide descriptive guidance that includes comparisons of reporting requirements between [https://web.archive.org/web/20111020013013/http://www.ifrs.org/home.htm IFRS] and U.S. GAAP.  As a result of establishing International Financial Reporting Standards, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111020013013/http://www.ifrs.org/home.htm IASB] and [http://www.fasb.org/home FASB] Conceptual Frameworks and Standards are in the process of being updated and converged to reflect the changes in markets, business practices and the economic environment that have occurred in the two or more decades since the concepts were first developed.  One of the foundations of a set of Financial Accounting Standards is the creation of a Conceptual Framework that defines the principles upon which the standards will be based.  Most major national and international accounting standards have developed conceptual frameworks to support their work on setting standards.

In contrast, management accounting principles have been overlooked from both a conceptual and a standards point of view and, for the most part, overshadowed by financial accounting standards.  [[Generally accepted accounting principles]] applies strictly to financial accounting because it was either the only guidance they had at the time, or did not know what else to do.&lt;ref name=Crisis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|title=Crisis !|journal=Strategic Finance|date=January 2007|pages=24–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Escaping&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=L.J. Matuszewski|author3= D.E. Tidrick|title=Escaping Professional Dominance?|journal=Cost Management|date=Sep–Oct 2011|pages=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Until recently, no serious work has been done by the accounting profession on the conceptual differences between the use of management accounting techniques to support GAAP financial reporting and management accounting techniques used for internal decision support.  This greatly compromises the management accounting practice and the ability of management accountants to provide managers with relevant decision support and optimization information. Yet, several innovative thinkers, shown in the Timeline below, saw value in management accounting having its own distinct set of principles.  Over the last century it is more and more evident that management accounting principles be viewed as "indispensable to the evaluation and improvement of MA methods and practices" (Clinton, Van der Merwe 2012).

==Historical timeline==
:'''1910 – Church. The History of Accounting'''.  The management accounting practice was originally discussed in a series of articles published in The Engineering Magazine.  As was typical of early management accounting practice after the industrial revolution, it was a topic of interest to engineers.  Church discussed practices that conveyed the management accounting principles of causality and analogy but never formally defined them.  The content of this series was reprinted in The History of Accounting Journal in 1976.&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite journal|last=Church|first=A.H.|title=Production Factors in Cost Accounting and Works Management|journal=The History of Accounting|year=1910|editor1=G.J. Previst |editor2=S.A. Zeff|publisher=Reprinted by Arno Press (1976)|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''1923 – [[John Maurice Clark]]. Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs'''.  Management Accounting theory developed and was embedded in his cost allocation discussion; Clark stressed the need to consider causes and their effects.  He was also the first to delineate operational cost concepts from decision cost concepts having introduced the concept of avoidability.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=J.M.|title=Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs|year=1923|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''1936 to 1954 – Committee on Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards (CACS)'''. Operating under the direction of the [http://aaahq.org/ American Accounting Association], CACS had determined to develop accounting principles and standards for all fields of accounting.&lt;ref name=CACS&gt;{{cite journal|author=Executive Committee of the American Accounting Association|title=Report of the Committee on Cost Concepts and Standards (CACS)|publisher=American Accounting Association|journal=The Accounting Review|date=April 1952|pages=831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''1954 – Benninger. [http://aaahq.org/pubs/acctrev.htm The Accounting Review]'''. ''"The principles accepted would not need to be restrictive, except in the sense that any proper practice restricts departure from it.  They should deal more with fundamental methods of expressing accounting facts than with the extent of "disclosures" in published statements."'' &lt;ref name=Benninger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benninger|first=L.J.|title=Development of Cost Accounting Concepts and Principles: Role of the Committee on Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards|journal=The Accounting Review|publisher=American Accounting Association|year=1954|pages=27–37 [33, 29]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''"… the cost accountant could be more effective the further his basic data were from the general ledger."'' &lt;ref name=Benninger/&gt;

:'''1979 – Shillinglaw. Cost Accounting Principles for External Reporting: A Conceptual Framework'''. ''"A body of concepts, principles, and practices has evolved over the years, gradually becoming what might be referred to as generally accepted cost accounting principles (1979, 157-158)."'' &lt;ref name=Shillinglaw79&gt;{{cite book|last=Shillinglaw|first=G.|title=Cost Accounting Principles for External Reporting: A Conceptual Framework|year=1979|publisher=University of Michigan|location=Ann Arbor|pages=157–183|editor=S. Zeff |editor2=J. Demski |editor3=N. Dopuch}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Note:''' Shillinglaw's proposed principles were only considered for the select area of Cost Accounting – one offshoot of management accounting to serve external financial accounting specifically.  His framework's stated intent was not to cater for Management Accounting per se but it nevertheless argued for causality as a principle.)

:'''1983 – Choudhury. [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rabr20/current Accounting and Business Research]'''.  In discussing the confusion surrounding the lack of common and meaningful management accounting terminology says, ''"… we are no nearer to being provided with a coherent theory of, if you like, a conceptual framework for management accounting."'' &lt;ref name=Choudhury&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choudhury|first=N.|title=Book Review of Advanced Management Accounting by R.S. Kaplan|journal=Accounting and Business Research|year=1983|volume= 14|issue= 53|pages=92–93|doi=10.1080/00014788.1983.9729193|publisher=Routledge - Taylor &amp; Francis Group|last2=Arnold|first2=John|last3=Ward|first3=C. W. R.|last4=Kirkman|first4=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choudhury did not; however, propose a management accounting conceptual framework.

:'''2002 – Richardson. Accounting Historians Journal'''. Alan Richardson documents five reasons why managerial accounting has been dominated by financial accounting:
# the use of financial accounting criteria to judge the quality of management accounting systems,
# the assignment of management accountants to subordinate positions in organizational units whose primary purpose was financial accounting,
# the dominance of financial accounting in the market for educational materials,
# the judgment of the labor market that a financial accountant could replace a management accountant (but not vice versa) and,
# the need for a young profession to gain and retain the support of established interests in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=A.|title=Professional Dominance: The Relationship Between Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|year=2002|pages=91–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Standards and Guidance section it states, ''"The purpose of principles-based good practice guidance is to encourage effective and efficient decision-making and the adoption of tools and techniques that can be applied intelligently within different types of organizations.

==Importance and objectives==
[[Management accounting]] for use inside an organization must reflect the reality of the operations and resources used by the organization in monetary terms. Unlike financial reporting, where the objective focuses on external investors and creditors seek to compare investment options across the capital markets, management accounting focuses on the economic choices and constraints within an organization. There are two interrelated parts in understanding why management accounting principles are so important and how these principles help managers achieve their primary objective: enterprise optimization.

The first principal part deals with the actual modeling of a company's operations, where the management accountant establishes and builds causal relationships based on the ''principle of causality'' and related management accounting concepts.  Part two involves the ''principle of analogy'' and the manager's analytical needs for decision support information provided by part one (its cause-and-effect relationships).  Part two requires analyzing the information in light of one or more decision alternatives so that the decision maker(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Note: The term ''decision maker'' is defined as any internal manager who works in any department, not just reserved for decision makers in the accounting/finance dept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; can reach the optimum decision.  The cumulative application of both principles (causality and analogy) achieves management accounting's objectives and fulfills the managers' needs – the optimization of the company's operations, generally referred to as enterprise optimization.

'''First objective - managerial costing is:''' 
* To provide a monetary reflection of the provision and utilization of business resources and,
* To provide cause and effect insights into past, present, or future enterprise economic activities.
'''Second objective – managerial costing aids managers:'''
* In their planning, analysis, and decision making and,
* Supports optimizing the achievement of an enterprise's strategic objectives.

At a more granular level the consistent application of management accounting's principles hold a number of benefits for an organization.
* Provide managers and employees with an accurate, objective cost model of the organization and cost information that reflects the use of the organization's resources.
* Present decision support information in a flexible mold that caters to the timeline and insights needed for internal decision makers.
* Provide decision makers insight into the marginal/incremental aspects of the alternatives they are considering.
* Model quantitative cause and effect linkages between outputs and the inputs required to produce and deliver final outputs.
* Accurately values all operations (support and production) of an entity (i.e. the supply and consumption of resources) in monetary terms.
* Provides information that aids in immediate and future economic decision making for optimization, growth, and/or attainment of enterprise strategic objectives.
* Provides information to evaluate performance and learn from results.
* Provides the basis and baseline factors for exploratory and predictive managerial activities

==Truth as the foundation==
It is managerial accountants' job to provide correct information to all internal managers.  In other words, the costing information gathered must be factual and truthful, as in 'what is the cost that reflects the actual use of the resources and processes'.  Therefore, truth corresponds to facts and when applied to Management Accounting it translates to resources in operation creates a factual situation.  Obviously, the resources and operations about which a manager makes decisions on are based on factual information.  The manager's decision will act to change the current situation since the manager is interested in the economic impact of the possible outcomes.

Philip Lawton, investment professional and co-author of ''The Top Ten Operational Risks: A Survival Guide for Investment Management Firms and Hedge Funds''&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|title=The Top Ten Operational Risks: A Survival Guide for Investment Management Firms and Hedge Funds|date=December 2010|publisher=Stone House Consulting, LLC|location=Thornton, PA|isbn=978-1456367879|pages=80|author=Holly H. Miller|author2=Philip Lawton}}&lt;/ref&gt;   writes 
::''"Managerial costing is not to be confused with [[cost accounting]]. The latter (cost accounting) applies financial reporting conventions to inventory valuation, transfer pricing, and the cost of goods and services sold, and it serves the informational requirements of external parties, including investors, creditors, regulators, and tax authorities. Managerial costing is intended for internal use; it supports the decisions that managers make to optimize operations. The authors observe, "The stock market clearly does not value a company for excellently prepared financial statements if operational excellence is lacking." Moreover, in order to capture outputs and their required inputs, well-executed managerial costing uses data drawn from operational and logistical systems rather than general ledger accounts. In this way, operational quantities and costs are tied to the organization's internal value chain."''&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Philip|title=Truth in Managerial Costing|url=http://middle-office.com/2012/07/20/truth-in-managerial-costing/|publisher=Middle Office|accessdate=30 July 2012|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Correspondence theory of truth]] was originally defined by Aristotle; however, a simpler and more up-to-date definition is: ''"A statement or opinion is true if what it corresponds to is a fact."''&lt;ref name=Angeles&gt;{{cite book|last=Angeles|first=P.A.|title=HarperCollins Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1992|publisher=Harper-Collins Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The correspondence definition of truth forms the foundational building blocks for management accounting's principles.   In this regard, the foundation of MAP is grounded in the laws of logic and structured reasoning outlined and discussed at length in the Management Accounting Philosophy series published in Cost Management.&lt;ref name=Philosophy1/&gt;  The recognition of truth as the basis for management accounting goes back a long way.
{{quotation|"It is very important that costs should not be regarded as something that may be manipulated, nor should they be thought of as representing anything but the cold truth, however unwelcome that may be."|Church, 1910}}

This emphasis on truth should not be confused with precision; it should be clear that costing methods are disputable, while principles are not.  Principles support managers who are required to make inferences about future outcomes of all the decision alternatives they are considering based on cause and effect insights. The use of principles enables managers to deal with causes and their effects in different time frames. This is not to say that management accounting is a science, it is not. But [[Decision science]] —that which management accounting supports, with the information it provides — is a science&lt;ref name=MCCF/&gt;{{cite journal|page=119}}
{{quotation|"In order to provide a sound basis for decisions, cost measurements should, in so far as possible, reflect the truth".|Benninger, 1954}}

The growth of management accounting and its practices as outlined in ''Management Accounting – Approaches, Techniques and Management Processes'',&lt;ref name=MAapproach/&gt; mentions that management accountants remain dissatisfied with the quality of their management accounting information in the absence of guiding principles.  This disconnect is clearly documented in research such as the ''2003 Survey of Management Accounting''&lt;ref name=Survey2003&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Survey of Management Accounting|url=http://www.imanet.org/resources_and_publications/research_studies_and_statements/ima_sponsored_studies.aspx|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Ernst &amp; Young,  LLP|author2=IMA|pages=24|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by Ernst &amp; Young LLP; co-sponsored by IMA and the follow up survey ''2012 Alta Via, SAP, and IMA Management Accounting Survey: A Replication and Longitudinal Comparison''.&lt;ref name=2012Survey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=L.R. White|title=2012 Alta Via, SAP, and IMA Management Accounting Survey: A Replication and Longitudinal Comparison|journal=Management Accounting Quarterly|date=(Forthcoming)|year=2012|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants|location=Montvale}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Confusion and frustration took hold of the MA profession partly because accountants were trying to satisfy two very different goals with one information system; the compliance needs of financial reporting (GAAP) alongside managerial costing decision analysis needs.  In addition, controllers, accountants, and managers who were seeking to improve operations or resolve internal costing issues discovered that when selecting different costing methods, each one subscribes to assorted allocation techniques and produces very different results.  And finally, the lack of a conceptual framework and foundational principles that previously did not exist in order to do costing for internal decision support.

Contradicting theories and practices do not instill trust or truth towards the optimization of an entity.  Foundational principles are intended to drive the classification of approaches, tools, and processes, thereby providing a way for accountants and managers to evaluate the tools and approaches they may be considering for the decision or costing tasks at hand.  The principles function as a way of better understanding the risks and compromises associated with a practice or method when it strays from the principles of causality and analogy.

==Not GAAP==
Companies need to identify the economic reality of their organization based on resources and operations, not reflect dollar values calculated using accrual-based accounting methods that conform to [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)]].  Accountants may argue that financial accounting principles represent true values and are more than sufficient for management accounting purposes.  Maximizing financial statement results is a primary objective; however, focusing only on accounting numbers or common financial ratios can lead to bad behavior versus focusing on operations and resource use for long term sustainable economic success.
By examining two of the four financial accounting principles, it will reveal that financial accounting principles (e.g., [[Historical cost]], [[Revenue recognition]], [[Matching principle]], and Full Disclosure) '''do not''' serve the objectives of management accounting. Let's examine the following two GAAP principles:

:a)	[[Historical cost]] principle (Kieso, Weygandt and Warfield)p38 – the only time this principle reflects ''cost''   is at the initial time of purchase or acquisition.  In subsequent periods, the historical cost along with taxation-driven depreciation methods does not help managers determine their current operational cost factors.

:b)	[[Matching principle]] (Kieso, Weygandt and Warfield)p40 – this principle mandates that the costs (expenses) must follow revenues or adopt the best ''"rational and systematic"'' allocation of costs associated with the benefit, including assumptions about when the benefit (and therefore costs) are to be received.  Clearly, managers who are required to perform a cost analysis would have no idea under the matching principle what costs would be included/excluded or be currently impacting his department.

The two financial accounting principles noted above briefly describes the chasm that exists between financial accounting and managerial accounting objectives.  Financial accounting's objective is to produce a coherent set of standards for consistency and comparability purposes; therefore, providing external parties in the capital markets, a level playing field for evaluating a company's individual performance as well as across other competing businesses.  Where Management accounting's objectives exist is to inform internal managers of the correct choices for long term economic success.

As discussed with Larry R. White, task force member of the Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework, in [http://www3.cfo.com/ CFO.com], 
::''"Manufacturing companies, in particular, often run into problems from the use of GAAP models for internal costing purposes, White notes. "We've seen factories where salesmen line up to get their orders run by the oldest production line in the factory, while there are brand-new production lines and machines sitting idle that would produce the order quicker and with better quality. The reason is that the factory was doing its costing based on a derivation of GAAP standards. Consequently, the fully depreciated machines didn't have a depreciation charge associated with them, where the newer machinery did."''&lt;ref name=CFO&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffelder|first=K.|title=Managerial Accountants Want Their Own Kind of Costing|url=http://www3.cfo.com/article/2012/7/gaap-ifrs_gaap-institute-of-management-accountants-international-federation-of-accountants|publisher=CFO.com|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts and Constraints==
[[File:MCCF v2.jpg|thumb|Diagram of ''Principles, Concepts, and Constraints'' specific to the field of [[Management Accounting]] and its internal business users.]]

===Principles===
Management accountants can rely on ''causality'' and ''analogy'' as foundational principles as they are grounded in decision science – the laws of logic.  
:* '''Causality principle''' — the relation between a managerial objective's quantitative output and the input quantities that must be, or must have been, consumed if the output is to be achieved.
Principle of Causality enables modeling the organization's costs based on the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the resources involved in the production of products and services it provides.  Often this is straightforward when dealing with strong causal relationships (i.e. raw materials to make product A).  However, where weaker causal relationships exist, costs need to be attributed according to the concept of attributability, which maintains the integrity of causality.
:* '''Analogy principle''' — the use of causal insights to infer past or future outcomes.
Principle of Analogy governs the user of management accounting information's ability to apply the knowledge or insights gained from the causal relationships modeled (e.g., in planning, control, what-if analysis) using inductive and deductive reasoning about past and future outcomes for continuous optimization efforts.

===Concepts===
The following '''concepts''' serve as operational guidelines and modeling building blocks to the two main principles (causality and analogy) in developing a reflective cause &amp; effect model and then using the information the model provides.  These concepts are intended to cover a variety of assumptions that would make up a model, their characteristics, and relationships and to provide rational perspectives when modeling many managerial costing issues.

The first '''ten concepts''' support the ''Principle of Causality'' the modeling of Cause&amp;Effect-based modeling principles, while the remaining '''four concepts''' are applicable to the ''Principle of Analogy'' and informational in nature and supports managers with decision making guidelines.

:'''Concepts applicable to causality and modeling:'''
* Attributability
* Capacity
* Cost
* Homogeneity
* Integrated data orientation
* Managerial objective
* Resource
* Responsiveness
* Traceability
* Work

:'''Concepts applicable to analogy and information use:'''
* Avoidability
* Divisibility
* Interdependence
* Interchangeability

===Constraints===
The following '''constraints''' have been identified for management accounting.  The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of these constraints are meant to serve as controls or checks and balances when constructing a cost model  or when using management accounting information.  The first '''five constraints''' are specific to '''Causality''' in the cost model, while the remaining '''two constraints''' deal with '''Analogy''' and the use of the information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/CFMC%20Draft%20for%20Review.pdf Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework]&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Constraints applicable to causality:'''
* Materiality
* Measurability
* Objectivity
* Verifiability

:'''Constraints applicable to analogy information use:'''
*Congruence
*Impartiality

'''Management process''' is a process of setting goals, [[plan]]ning and/or [[Control (management)|controlling]] the [[organizing (management)|organizing]] and leading the execution of any type of activity, such as: 
* a [[project]] ([[project management process]]) or
* a process ([[process management]] process, sometimes referred to as the process performance measurement and management system).

An [[organization]]'s [[senior management]] is responsible for carrying out its management process. However, this is not always the case for all management processes, for example, it is the responsibility of the project manager to carry out a project management process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/the-simplified-project-management-process The Simplified Project Management Process] Accessed: 2010-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Steps==
'''Planning,'' it determines the objectives, evaluate the different alternatives and choose the best

'''Organizing,''' define group's functions, establish relationships and defining authority and responsibility

'''Staffing,''' recruitment or placement and selection or training takes place for the development of  members in the firm

'''directing,''' is to give the Direction to the employes.

'''Media Park''' ({{IPA-nl|meːdiə pɑrk}}) is a large [[business park]] in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Hilversum]]. This site is home to a number of Dutch broadcasters and media companies, and is the headquarters of the national public broadcasting system [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|NPO]].

==Notable events==

On 6 May 2002, right-wing politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] was [[assassination of Pim Fortuyn|assassinated]] after a radio interview with [[Ruud de Wild]] at [[3FM]]. 

On 29 January 2015, a 19-year-old man invaded the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] building, carrying a fake pistol and taking a hostage; he claimed to be part of a hackers' collective, and demanded ten minutes of airtime on the 8pm edition of [[NOS Journaal]]; however, he was swiftly overpowered by police and arrested. As a result of this, the building was evacuated, and no 8pm news was broadcast that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31051114|title=Man with fake gun disrupts Dutch broadcaster NOS|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting companies==
The broadcasting associations [[Omroep MAX|MAX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omroepmax.nl/?waxtrapp=ytnihDsHnHUVOMbBG|title=Omroep MAX 2012 - Organisatie|publisher=Omroep Max|accessdate=2012-03-09|language=Dutch|quote=Op het Media Park in Hilversum is Omroep MAX gevestigd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omroep.vara.nl/Contact.723.0.html|title=Contact: VARA|publisher=Omroepvereniging VARA|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330060108/http://omroep.vara.nl/Contact.723.0.html|archivedate=2012-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[VPRO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpro.nl/overdevpro/3779664/adres+en+contact|title=VPRO : Over de VPRO : Adres en contact|publisher=VPRO|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which broadcast on public television channels such as [[Nederland 1]] and also on public radio stations, are located on the Media Park site.

==Transport==
[[File:Traverse Hilversum Noord - Media Park.jpg|thumb|right|Footbridge between the site and [[Hilversum Noord railway station]]]]
Media Park is served well by public transport and by the Dutch road network. The southern corner of the site is close to the [[Ring Hilversum|Hilversum ring road]], and the regional [[N524 road]] runs along the east side of the site, connecting it with the nearby towns of [[Naarden]] and [[Bussum]], and southeast [[Amsterdam]] via the [[N236 road|N236]].

[[Hilversum Noord railway station]] is served by local Sprinter services between [[Hilversum railway station|Hilversum]], Amsterdam and [[Schiphol railway station|Schiphol]]. A [[footbridge]] was constructed across the N524 (''Mies Bouwmanboulevard'') in 2011, directly linking the station and buildings on the Media Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hilversumbeterbereikbaar.nl/index.php?page=1-4-2&amp;id=424|title=Kijkbuis feestelijk geopend|date=2011-09-15|publisher=Gemeente Hilversum|work=Hilversum Beter Bereikbaar|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Michael Fay''' (born 1949) is a [[New Zealand]] merchant banker and partner in the [[merchant bank]] [[Fay Richwhite]]. He was educated at [[St Peter's College, Auckland]], [[St Patrick's College, Silverstream]] and [[Victoria University of Wellington]] ([[LL.B]] - 1972).

He is one of the ten richest men in New Zealand. His personal wealth was largely acquired during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which included the period in which he had a significant role in the structural adjustment of the New Zealand economy undertaken by New Zealand's [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]]. He is thought to be worth in excess of NZD 920 million, making him the 10th richest New Zealand citizen in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-zealand-rich-list-released-big-winners-and-losers-collectively-worth-over-80-billion |title=New Zealand Rich List released - the big winners and losers who are collectively worth over $80 billion |date=24 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fay Richwhite==
Michael Fay and [[David Richwhite]] are best known for gaining wealth in a series of loosely regulated privatisation and asset swapping transactions that occurred between 1986 and 1993 - involving their companies European Pacific, [[Capital Markets]] and [[Fay Richwhite]] and the former state owned operations [[Bank of New Zealand]], [[Tranz Rail]] and [[Telecom New Zealand]], and the pension accounts associated to them.

One notable transaction among these actions was their role as advisors to the government on the sale of [[Tranz Rail|New Zealand Rail Limited]] to overseas interests; a deal in which Fay and Richwhite later bought 31.8 per cent of the shares, and were subsequently investigated for insider trading by NZ authorities.

===Securities Commission case===
In October 2004 the [[Securities Commission of New Zealand|New Zealand Securities Commission]] accused Richwhite and Midavia Rail Investments, a company owned by Richwhite and Fay, of [[insider trading]]. Richwhite was alleged to have tipped off Midavia to sell $63 million worth of Tranz Rail shares, whilst knowing Tranz Rail faced financial problems undisclosed to the public. In June 2007, Midavia paid $20 million&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news |title=Richwhite and Midavia pay $20m over insider trading case |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10446388 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=NZ Herald |agency=NZPA |date=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec-com.govt.nz/new/releases/2007/180607.shtml |title=Securities Commission settles insider trading case with Midavia and Richwhite |date=18 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLuI3HA?url=http://www.sec-com.govt.nz/new/releases/2007/180607.shtml |archivedate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0706/S00292.htm Midavia, Richwhite insider trading case settled] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLucAhS?url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0706/S00292.htm |date=February 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to settle insider trading proceedings relating to Tranz Rail. The commission stated that the payments had been made "without any admission of liability".&lt;ref name=herald /&gt; The settlement is the largest of its kind ever seen in Australasia.

==America's Cup==
Fay backed New Zealand's first [[America's Cup]] campaign in 1987, which won through to the [[1987 Louis Vuitton Cup|challenger's final]] before losing to a US entry from [[San Diego]].

In 1988 Fay backed a challenge to the [[San Diego Yacht Club]], who had just won the [[1987 America's Cup|America's Cup]].  Rather than wait three to four years and join a general international challenge as had been the custom for thirty-five years, he had his legal team review the original [[Deed of Gift of the America's Cup|Deed of Gift]]. The Deed of Gift was the  document drawn up by the owners of the 100 Guineas Cup, won by the yacht America, to offer the cup for international competition.  The deed did not specify a time delay between challenges, nor were competitors limited to compete in a particular class of boat, nor did boats have to be the same size or class.  Fay financed the creation of ''[[KZ1 (yacht)|KZ 1]]'', a large single-hull [[yacht]] which complied with the original Deed of Gift but was much larger and hence faster than the [[12-metre class]] boats which had been used for [[America's Cup]] competition for many years. [[Dennis Conner]], skipper of the American defender, responded by building the multihull [[Stars &amp; Stripes (yacht)|Stars &amp; Stripes]] (US-1). Court actions followed which decided that both boats complied with the original Deed of Gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==The concept of organization’s face ==
The concept of organization’s face represents something that identifies and distinguishes the organization from other similar organizations. This concept is based on tow underlying metaphors:
#	The organization as a natural system.&lt;ref name=scott1998&gt;Scott, W. Richard. (1998). ''Organizations: Rational, Natural, and Open Systems, 4th edn ''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
#	The organization as an organism&lt;ref name=morgan2006&gt;Morgan, Gareth. (2006). ''Images of Organization''. Newbury Park. CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Organizations as living entity such as humans can be distinguished by face factor from each other.
The question is what are the factors that determine an organization’s face? To answer this question, should be attention to pillars of an organization.&lt;ref name="scott1998"/&gt;
Every organization has at least five following pillars.&lt;ref name="scott1998"/&gt;
:
#	People
#	Goals  
#	Structure 
#	Technology  
#	Environment

With an emphasis on each of the organizational pillars, a specific type of organization’s face is formed.Every organization can demonstrate five general face, simultaneously or separately:
#	Humanistic face
#	Goal oriented face
#	Structure oriented face
#	Technology based face
#	Environment based face
Each of these faces is divided into more specific faces.

==History==

Panaya was founded in 2006 as ''ChangeSoft Technologies'' by entrepreneur [[Yossi Cohen]] and is headquartered in [[Ra'anana, Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.menlopark.com/directory-listing/Panaya/331527 | title=Panaya in Menlo Park | publisher=Menlo Park | accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruptive technology revolves around the impact analyses of code change, applied in code comparison of [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems to help reduce the application life cycle cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country =US  | number =2009216712 | status =  | title =Methods for calculating a combined impact analysis repository | pubdate =27 August 2009  | gdate =  | fdate =  | pridate =  | inventor =Cohen, Yossi; Cohen, Mati; Dor, Nurit; Weiss, Dror; Armoni, Roy | assign1 =  | assign2 =  | class = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A first patent application was filed in 2008, followed by an extension in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20090827ptan20090216712.php | title=Methods for calculating a combined impact analysis repository | publisher=Fresh Patents | accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a continuation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20130214ptan20130041886.php | title=Methods for calculating a combined impact analysis repository | publisher=Fresh Patents | date=14 February 2013 | accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, shares of [[Tamares Group]], a [[private equity]] investment firm based in [[Vaduz]], [[Liechtenstein]], were acquired by Panaya as part of fundraising round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tamares.com/portfolio/selected-investments-private/panaya | title=Panaya Portfolio | publisher=Tamares | accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Beckford jnr.jpg|thumb|right|Posthumous portrait of Peter Beckford by [[Benjamin West]]]]
'''Peter Beckford (junior)''' (1672/3 – 1735) was a politician and businessman in early [[Colony of Jamaica|colonial Jamaica]].

He was the son of [[Peter Beckford]], founder of one of the most powerful families on the island, and briefly acting [[List_of_governors_of_Jamaica#Governors_of_Jamaica_(1690%E2%80%931962)|governor of the colony]]. Like his father, Beckford junior suffered a severe temper. As a young man, he was accused of killing the Deputy Judge Advocate of Jamaica in a fit of temper, but was acquitted after a lengthy court case.

Peter junior joined the [[House of Assembly of Jamaica]] and became the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]. During a debate in 1710, things became extremely heated and some members drew their swords and threatened him. The Governor responded to shouts for assistance and the doors of the chamber were forced open. The Assembly was dissolved in the name of the Queen. The aged Peter Beckford senior was amongst those who had come to his rescue. In the general confusion, he slipped and fell down the long staircase. Suffering a mortal injury, he died soon after.

In 1720, Peter junior was one of the prominent people in Jamaica about whom the [[governors of Jamaica|governor]] Sir [[Nicholas Lawes]] complained had "anarchical principles". He went into business with [[Sir Alexander Grant, 5th Baronet|Alexander Grant]], leasing a storehouse from which the partners sold supplies to other plantation owners.&lt;ref name="LBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Alexander Grant, 5th Bart.|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146632678|website=Legacies of British Slave-ownership|publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter married Bathshua Herring and they had thirteen children, including [[William Beckford (politician)|William]], who was twice Lord Mayor of London, and [[Elizabeth Howard, Countess of Effingham|Elizabeth]], who became Countess of Effingham. He died in 1735. His will included a legacy of £2,000 to found a school in [[Spanish Town]], which was started there in 1744. This school merged with another school started with £3,000 donated by Francis Smith forming the Beckford and Smith School in 1869.

His son [[William Beckford (politician)|William]] was born in 1709. William emigrated to England and had a prominent career in politics, defending the [[West India Interest]], i.e. lobbying against the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], first as a [[Member of Parliament]] and then as [[Lord Mayor of London]].

==Gameplay==
In Pop Cutie!, the player is put in charge of a fashion [[boutique]], and is required to design, and sell clothes. Making clothes requires collecting keywords, which certain combination of words creates certain pieces of clothing. To sell your clothes, you must set up a store, and stock it with your items, as well as hire employees to take care of the store. You are set against rivals, who like you are selling clothes. In game you can also take part in "fashion battles", in which you are put against a rival to design an outfit based on a certain number of items. Your outfit is then judged on several criteria.

The game is broke into several stages, in which you must meet a certain objective to get to the next stage. In different stages your store is located in a different part of town, as well, the size of your store also changes, as well as your rivals.

'''Richard J. Brenneke''' (December 5 1941 - July 23 2015&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://obits.oregonlive.com/obituaries/oregon/obituary.aspx?n=richard-j-brenneke-luck&amp;pid=175389598|title = Richard J. "Luck" Brenneke's Obituary on The Oregonian|website = The Oregonian|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a US businessman who testified in 1988 that he had worked in Southeast Asia with the CIA's [[Air America (airline)|Air America]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; among other roles.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle McManus, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 25 October 1988, [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-25/news/mn-285_1_hostage-negotiations/4 1980 Deal Alleged : Leads, Leaps of Faith in Hostage Tale]&lt;/ref&gt; Brenneke testified to the Senate's [[Kerry Committee report|Kerry Committee]] on [[allegations of CIA drug trafficking]], and his evidence was considered by the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] on the 1980 [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|October Surprise affair]].

==Career==
[[William Northrop]], an Israeli intelligence agent indicted in the [[Brokers of Death arms case]], testified at Brenneke's perjury trial in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in April 1990. Northrop had previously worked with Brenneke in the CIA’s effort to supply the Afghan Resistance fighting the [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;18 Crile, George, CHARLIE WILSON’S WAR, Grove Press, New York, 2003, p. 372; [http://www.idfiles.com/rbdepo.htm Deposition of Richard J. Brenneke], Joint Investigation by the Arkansas State Attorney General's Office and the U.S. Congress, Little Rock, Arkansas, June 21, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1986 Brenneke was listed by the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' as one of 16 of a "cast of characters" involved in the Iran-Contra affair, describing him as "An Oregon real estate developer with extensive contacts in Iran. Says he was involved, with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]], in an attempt to sell 39 F-4E fighter planes to Iran in 1985. Says he met with several Iranian officials."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', 7 December 1986, [http://articles.philly.com/1986-12-07/news/26068279_1_max-gomez-iran-arms-sale-first-arms-shipment The Iran-contra Arms Deal: A Cast Of Characters]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Called before a Senate subcommittee on narcotics and international relations in 1988, Brenneke claimed to have run drugs from Colombia to the U.S. as part of a Contra supply operation. He also testified to having purchased arms in Czechoslovakia for the Nicaraguan rebels. That testimony was called ''slanderous'' by then-[[George H. W. Bush|Vice President Bush,]] and a 1989 Senate committee report concluded that Brenneke never had the Central Intelligence Agency connections he claimed."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Johnston, ''[[New York Times]]'', 11 June 1988, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/11/us/senate-panel-s-top-republican-says-chairman-politicized-drug-inquiry.html Senate Panel's Top Republican Says Chairman Politicized Drug Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rupp trial (1988)===
On 23 September 1988, Brenneke voluntarily testified at the sentencing hearing of Heinrich Rupp, a "close friend" who had been convicted of bank fraud.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; Brenneke testified that Rupp believed he was acting on behalf of the CIA in carrying out the fraud, which Brenneke said was part of a much wider CIA scheme to gain funding for covert operations by defrauding [[savings and loan association]]s. Brenneke cited [[Indian Springs State Bank]] as an example - the bank had loaned money to [[Global International Airways]], a company involved in the [[Iran-Contra affair]], and the Iranian [[Farhad Azima]] had been a major shareholder of the bank and also owner of the airline.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; A 1975 ID card Brenneke supplied to a ''[[Houston Post]]'' reporter showed Rupp as a pilot for the airline.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

Brenneke said that he and Rupp had been involved in various covert operations for the agency in the past. He said he and Rupp and been involved in such matters since Brenneke's days at the CIA's [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], beginning in 1967.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', 6 June 1990, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/06/us/man-cleared-of-lying-in-remarks-on-reagan-aides-and-52-hostages.html Man Cleared of Lying in Remarks On Reagan Aides and 52 Hostages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; As an example of the kind of covert operations he and Rupp had been involved in, Brenneke said that he and Rupp had been involved in some of the meetings at which the 1980 [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|October Surprise affair]] was arranged.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; Brenneke said that on the night of 18 October 1980, Rupp had flown [[William Casey]] from Washington's National Airport to Paris' [[Le Bourget Airfield]] for a series of secret meetings. These meetings (on 19 and 20 October) involved negotiations between Iranian representatives and members of the Reagan-Bush campaign. Brenneke testified he was present at the last of three meetings, on the details of the cash and weapons involved, at which Casey and [[Donald Gregg]] were also present. Brenneke also testified that [[George H.W. Bush]] was present in Paris for the meetings, but a month after his deposition he amended his statement by letter to the judge, clarifying that his knowledge of Bush's presence was not first-hand but came from Rupp.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

===Perjury trial (1989 - 1990)===
For his role in the Rupp trial, Brenneke was charged with five counts of making false declarations to a federal judge, a charge slightly stronger than [[perjury]].&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Marilynn Wheeler, [[Associated Press]], 6 May 1990, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Jury-Foreman-Says-He-Never-Doubted-Brenneke-s-Innocence/id-26207f1adffd774dbedd323aeeb79095 Jury Foreman Says He Never Doubted Brenneke's Innocence]&lt;/ref&gt; He was indicted on 12 May 1989, accused of lying about his and Rupp's CIA connections and about the October Surprise meetings.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; The timing caused some speculation that the charges were intended to avoid political embarrassment for [[Donald Gregg]], whose Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment as Ambassador to South Korea began the same day: the charges prevented senators from raising accusations Brenneke had made in 1988 that Gregg had directed the [[Iran-Contra affair]] out of the Vice-President's office.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee May, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 13 May 1989, [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-13/news/mn-2673_1_contra-supply-scheme-el-salvador-and-resupply-donald-p-gregg Panel Probes Ex-Bush Aide on Contra Supply Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution offered Brenneke a deal that would keep him out of prison if he pleaded guilty; he refused.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

The prosecution produced a CIA personnel specialist who testified that he could not find Brenneke or Rupp in the Agency's employment records, but under cross-examination admitted that Rupp had been trained by the CIA's [[Intermountain Aviation]], and that the Agency had "files" on both Rupp and Brenneke. [[Frank Snepp]] testified that CIA contract agents were often not listed in employment records where the agents were involved in sensitive operations.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; Two intelligence operatives from Texas testified to collaborating with Brenneke.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Mitromaco, [http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1990/eirv17n21-19900518/eirv17n21-19900518_066-jury_refuses_to_buy_bushs_iran_c.pdf Jury refuses to buy Bush's Iran-Contra story], ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'' 17(21), 18 May 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Gregg testified that on 18 October 1980 he was not in Paris but on holiday in Delaware, providing in evidence family photographs he said were taken that weekend. A meteorologist testified that the sunny weather conditions made it highly unlikely that they had been taken that weekend in that location.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; The prosecution failed to prove that Casey and Bush could not have attended the Paris meetings.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; Defense witnesses included [[William Northrop]], an Israeli intelligence agent indicted in the [[Brokers of Death arms case]], which had been dropped in January 1989 on the grounds that the prosecution could not disprove the defendants' claims that they believed the planned arms shipments to Iran were or could be government-sanctioned. Northrop testified that Israeli arms shipments to Iran began "within a fortnight" of the Paris meeting.&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

On 4 May 1990, after only five hours of deliberation, the jury found Brenneke "not guilty" on all five counts. Following the trial, jury foreman Mark Kristoff stated,  "We were convinced that, yes, there was a meeting, and he was there and the other people listed in the indictment were there.... There never was a guilty vote.... It was 100 percent."&lt;ref name=Verdict&gt;David Armstrong and Alex Constantine, "The Verdict is Treason", ''[[Z Magazine]]''; July/August 1990.

===Brenneke's records===
In 1991, [[Peggy Adler]] was retained by Brenneke to co-author his autobiography.&lt;ref name="hartford courant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/1992-04-14/news/0000203264_1_october-surprise-richard-brenneke-bulletproof-vest|title=Research Draws Illustrator Into 'October Surprise' Intrigue|date=14 April 1992|journal=[[Hartford Courant]]| last = Bixby | first = Lyn |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovering evidence in his files contradicting some of his claims regarding his presence at [[October Surprise conspiracy]] meetings, she contacted former [[CIA]] agent-turned-journalist, [[Frank Snepp]]. Snepp included this evidence (of credit card receipts showing a presence in Portland when Brenneke said he was in Paris) in a February 1992 article he wrote for the  ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref name=surprise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_cr/h920224-october.htm |title= October Surmise |first= Frank| last= Snepp | publisher = Congressional Record (reprinted from ''[[Village Voice]]'', 25 February 1992)|date= |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler's work was the subject of a chapter in [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]]'s book, ''"Trick or Treason: The October Surprise Mystery"'' and she was interviewed by [[PBS]]' ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' in this regard, aired in April 1992.&lt;ref name=frontline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/info/1016.html |title=Investigating the October Surprise|publisher=Frontline (PBS) |date=7 April 1992 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-1992, learning that the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] was investigating whether or not there actually had been an October Surprise, she contacted  investigative journalist and author [[Steven Emerson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[American Journalism Review]]|title=No October Surprise | first =Steven | last = Emerson |date=March 1993 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3138/is_n2_v15/ai_n28622664/pg_2/ | accessdate=9 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who put her in touch with the Task Force so that she could turn over to them the seventy cartons of documents she'd hauled east from Brenneke's home in Portland, Oregon, in order to write his memoirs. In the month of June Adler worked as a consultant to the Task Force.&lt;ref name=TF1&gt;[[Media:Charlie Rose TF Letter.pdf|Peggy Adler employed as an Assistant Investigator by the U.S. House of Representatives' October Surprise Task Force (pdf)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 17 December 1992 press conference at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]], responding to the Senate report, Barbara Honegger (who published a book on October Surprise in 1989 on the day Brenneke was indicted for false declarations) introduced new evidence, saying that an expert [[graphology|graphologist]]'s examination of the critical credit card receipts for a motel and a restaurant in October 1980 indicated the handwriting was not Brenneke's. Honegger also said that a manager of the relevant restaurant who had been there since 1979 told her that no waitress by the name on the receipt had worked there. Honegger also spoke to the organisers of a Kendo tournament Brenneke was said to have attended, who told her that there was no record of Brenneke attending the event, while five eyewitnesses agreed that Brenneke had not been present on 19–20 October (one said he had been there on 18 October).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJl6FzmLBAY&amp;feature=youtu.be October Surprise Press Conference - Barbara Honegger - 1992], c 8-20 mins into recording.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other matters===
In mid-1990 Brenneke provided documents to Italian journalists regarding [[Licio Gelli]] and [[Propaganda Due]] (P2), asserting CIA support for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[La Repubblica]]'', 4 July 1990, [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1990/07/04/gelli-agente-della-cia-la-parola.html GELLI E L' AGENTE DELLA CIA LA PAROLA E' AI MAGISTRATI ]&lt;/ref&gt; Brenneke told [[Rai 1]] that he had been involved in CIA payments to P2 of $1–$10m per month or more, with the money used to finance terrorism and drug trafficking. The CIA rejected a FOIA request regarding Gelli on grounds of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Willan (2002), ''Puppetmasters: The Political Use of Terrorism in Italy'', [[iUniverse]], pp77-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Willan (2013), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AeufAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 The Vatican at War: From Blackfriars Bridge to Buenos Aires]'', [[iUniverse]], pp90-97&lt;/ref&gt; Gelli and others were later convicted of subverting investigation into the 1980 [[Bologna Massacre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">The term '''Safe Work Procedure''' (SWP) originated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], and is predominantly used as a [[risk management]] tool by industries throughout Australia, particularly in the [[mining]] sector. SWPs are also referred to using other terms, such as [[Standard Operating Procedure]] (SOPre) (SOP). A Safe Work Procedure is a step by step description of a process when deviation may cause a loss. This risk control document created by teams within the company describes the safest and most efficient way to perform a task. This document stays in the Health &amp; Safety system for regular use as a template or guide when completing that particular task on site.

==Requirements of Safe Work ==

The document generally lists the associated hazards involved in performing a task, what risk score is associated with the hazards (using a [[risk matrix]]), what personal protective equipment is required, and the steps involved to complete the activity without incident.

The document is split up to meet the above requirements as follows;
*[[Procedure (term)|Step]]
*[[Hazard]]s
*[[Inherent risk]]
*[[Control measure]]s
*[[Residual risk]]

Each person involved in that task on site must ensure all sections of the SWP are followed.

Safe Work Procedures are also required for machinery and equipment that is used to perform commercial activities. The procedures are required to be enforced within the workplace and improved as conditions or equipment changes.

At the time, it was a part of [[Vyborg Governorate]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In 1919, Finland became independent and the governorate was transformed into [[Viipuri Province]]. Enso became a part of the Jääski Municipality, with the seat in [[Lesogorsky|Jääski]].
[[File:Финская вилла.jpg|thumb|left|The Finnish villa (1930) at Kantorovicha Street]]

The territory was ceded by [[Finland]] to the [[Soviet Union]] by the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] as a result of the [[Winter War]]. After the Winter War, the Finns and the Soviets disagreed on the interpretation of the peace treaty regarding Enso. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland [[Väinö Tanner]] wrote in his memoirs: "Already now a dispute about the district of Enso developed. According to the map attached to the peace treaty Enso was clearly intended to belong to Finland but the Russians claimed that it should belong to them. Later the map was redrawn according to the interests of the Russians so that the border bends at Enso." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Väinö|title=Olin ulkoministerinä talvisodan aikana|trans-title=I Was Foreign Minister During Winter War|page=415|language=Finnish|publisher=Tammi|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940, Enso became a part of [[Lesogorsky District|Yaskinsky District]] with the [[administrative center]] in the [[urban-type settlement|work settlement]] of [[Lesogorsky|Yaski]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} It was a part of the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], after March&amp;nbsp;31, 1940 of the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="KASSR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istmat.info/files/uploads/17632/sssr_ad-ter_delenie_1941_karelo-finskaya_ssr.pdf|script-title=ru:Карело-Финская ССР|publisher=Handbook of administrative divisions of Soviet Union|language=Russian|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ryti Mannerheim.JPG|thumb|left|[[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], Marshal of Finland, and [[Risto Ryti]], President of Finland in Enso on June 4, 1944]]
Enso was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during the [[Continuation War]] but was again ceded to Soviets by the [[Moscow Armistice]]. This secession was formalized after signing the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] in 1947. The Finnish population was resettled to Finland,&lt;ref name="hist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vbglenobl.ru/raion/istoriya-raiona|script-title=ru:История Выборгского района, история Выборгской земли|trans-title=The history of the Vyborgsky District, the history of the Vyborg land |publisher=Муниципальное образование Выборгский район Ленинградской Области|language=Russian|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while migrants from Central Russia resettled the Karelian Isthmus.

On November&amp;nbsp;24, 1944, Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish SSR to Leningrad Oblast.&lt;ref name="LesogorskyDHist" /&gt; On October&amp;nbsp;1, 1948, the district was renamed Lesogorsky and on January&amp;nbsp;13, 1949, all Finnish names of the localities were replaced with Russian names.&lt;ref name="LesogorskyDHist" /&gt; In particular, Enso was renamed Svetogorsk.&lt;ref name="LesogorskyDHist" /&gt; On December&amp;nbsp;9, 1960, Lesogorsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District.&lt;ref name="LesogorskyDHist" /&gt;

In 1972, the Soviet Union awarded Finland a construction project for a large new cellulose and paper mill in Svetogorsk. The project was paid with Soviet crude oil. The project also gave a start to cross-border relations. Notably, the construction workers in Svetogorsk were called "builders", and the project also had intent to "build friendship between peoples".

On April&amp;nbsp;18, 2008, about five hundred inhabitants of Svetogorsk participated in a protest which included a road barricade on the [[Finnish–Russian border]] as a protest against poor road conditions and lack of investment in road improvement at both federal and municipal level. According to the Finnish public service broadcaster [[Yle]], the militia{{clarification needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--the [[militsiya|police]] or the protesters' militia?--&gt; participated in effectively cutting off through traffic. The main issue of discontent was the lack of a bypass, which, according to reports, should have already been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mielenosoittajat sulkivat rajaliikenteen Svetogorskissa|agency=YLE Uutiset|publisher=YLE|date=May 24, 2012|url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/oikea/id88309.html|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;!--If this URL dies, try this one: http://yle.fi/uutiset/mielenosoittajat_sulkivat_rajaliikenteen_svetogorskissa/5832264--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative and municipal status==
[[File:Svetogorsk.jpg|thumb|Apartment buildings in Svetogorsk]]
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with the [[urban-type settlement]] of [[Lesogorsky]] and two [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated within [[Vyborgsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Vyborgsky District]] as '''Svetogorskoye [[Town of district significance|Settlement Municipal Formation]]'''.&lt;ref name="LeningradO_adm"&gt;Oblast Law #32-oz&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Vyborgsky Municipal District as '''Svetogorskoye Urban Settlement'''.&lt;ref name="LeningradOVyborgskyD_mun"&gt;Law #17-oz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
===Industry===
Before the [[Winter War]], the town was a major factory site for [[Stora Enso|Enso-Gutzeit Oy]], the Finnish pulp and paper company (now [[Stora Enso]]). In the 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], the new Finnish-Soviet border was deliberately drawn to leave the factory complex on the Soviet side. The town's major industry is still [[pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]].

OAO ''Svetogorsk'', one of the biggest [[paper mill]]s in Russia, is the major employer. Covering {{convert|2|km2|sp=us}}, OAO ''Svetogorsk'' produces [[pulp (paper)|pulp]], printing [[paper]], and packaging board. Its brands include ''[[Svetocopy]]'' and ''Ballet'' office paper. Since December 1998, OAO ''Svetogorsk'' has been majority owned by [[International Paper]]. At end of 2001, the plant employed 3,000&amp;nbsp;people; by 2008 this had fallen to 2,200.{{fact|date=September 2016}}

Immediately adjacent to OAO ''Svetogorsk'' is a tissue mill. This formed part of the original mill complex but was split-away and resold by International Paper to [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget|SCA]] during the acquisition of OAO ''Svetogorsk'' from [[Tetra Pak|Tetra Laval]], which controlled the plant since 1995. ''Svetogorsk Tissue'', as the separate entity was to be called, became fully integrated into SCA Hygiene Products Division in 2003 (called [[Essity]] since 2017). It employs around four hundred people. Its products include ''[[Zewa]]'' and ''[[SCA Tissue Europe|Tork]]'' brands of paper towels and [[toilet paper]].

===Border crossing===
The [[Imatra]]–Svetogorsk [[Finnish–Russian border|border]] crossing plays a key role in the transportation of timber between Russia and Finland. Also, around 150&amp;nbsp;employees commute daily from Imatra to the paper mills. The border crossing, which had temporary status, was a frequent cause of bottlenecks due to lengthy customs checks and inadequate facilities. A Russia-Finland agreement in 1997 allowed the development and eventual permanence of the border crossing. This €7 million [[European Union]] [[Technical Aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States|TACIS]]-funded project ran from 1999 and the new international frontier, capable of handling 1,300&amp;nbsp;cars per day, opened on July&amp;nbsp;3, 2002.

===Transportation===
Svetogorsk is connected by railway with [[Kamennogorsk]], where it has connection to the old [[Vyborg–Joensuu railroad]]. There is suburban traffic to [[Vyborg]]. The continuation of the railroad beyond Svetogorsk to the [[Finnish–Russian border]] is disused.

Svetogorsk is connected by roads with Kamennogorsk and Vyborg, as well as with [[Imatra]] across the border.

==Sister city==
Svetogorsk has one [[twin towns and sister cities|sister city]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.47news.ru/2009/02/03/015/ Svetogorsk is getting a sister city]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telecom Egypt''' ({{lang-arz|المصرية للاتصالات}}), is [[Egypt]]'s primary [[telephone company]]. It started in 1854 with the first telegraph line in [[Egypt]]. In 1998, it replaced the former Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunication Organization (ARENTO).

The company has a fixed-line subscriber base in excess of 6 million subscribers.

Telecom Egypt acquired [[TEData]] (formerly GegaNet) in late 2001 to act as its [[data communications]] and [[ISP]] arm. The company has another [[Information technology|IT]] arm, Xceedcc - Xceed contact center - located in Egypt's Smart Village.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Xceed_Contact_Center.jpg|thumb|right|Xceedcc Building in Smart Village]] --&gt;Telecom Egypt also owns 44.95% of [[Vodafone Egypt]]. Telecom Egypt has adopted the contemporary quality integration trends and established the quality sector in 2001, which is now preparing the whole company to take the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 9000|9001-2000]] certificate.

Its main operational offices are in [[Cairo]], [[Al Mansurah]], [[Ismailia]], [[Alexandria]], [[Suez]] and [[Tanta]].&lt;ref name="TelecomEgypt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=CIA|first1=United States|title=The CIA World Factbook 2010, Book 2010|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=9781602397279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqanFyF6nI0C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Egyptian+telephone+system,+Tanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP2pT1-q3QAhXKrlQKHbrPC4kQ6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Egyptian%20telephone%20system%2C%20Tanta&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2016, Telecom Egypt (TE) became a fully-fledged mobile operator after agreeing to pay E£7.08 billion (€713.14 million) for a 4G licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/242070/Business/Economy/Telecom-Egypt-becomes-the-countrys-first-operator-.aspx|title=Telecom Egypt becomes the country's first operator to secure 4G licence - Economy - Business - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2017, Telecom Egypt launched its mobile service, branded as '''WE'''.

==History==

===Origins===
The government initiative that later became Telecom Egypt started as a telegraph line between the [[Cairo Governorate|Governorate of Cairo]] and the [[Alexandria Governorate|Governorate of Alexandria]] in 1854 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecom Egypt goes live with Ascade's Routing Solution|url=http://www.ascade.com/about-us/news/telecom-egypt-press-release/|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; built by the British Eastern Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Period of Muhammad Ali|url=http://www.egyptianagriculture.com/muhammad_ali.html|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's first telephone line was installed between Cairo and Alexandria in 1881. In 1881, the Egyptian government purchased the Eastern Telephone Company and created the Telephone and Telegraph Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Information Society Watch - Egypt|url=http://www.giswatch.org/en/country-report/civil-society-participation/egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Law No.&amp;nbsp;107 of 1957, all assets of the Eastern Company and other telecommunications providers were transferred to the Ministry of Telecommunications. In the same year, Presidential Decree No.&amp;nbsp;709 placed all wire and wireless communications under the jurisdiction of the Wire and Wireless Communications Authority which reported to the Ministry of Transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hashish|first=Mohamed|title=The Egyptian Legislation Governing the Information and Communication Technology Sector|url=http://www.arablegalportal.org/financial/legaldocs/ICT/egypt/Egypt-ICT-legislation.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215505/http://www.arablegalportal.org/financial/legaldocs/ICT/egypt/Egypt-ICT-legislation.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunications Organization (ARENTO) was established in 1980 as an autonomous public utility reporting to the Ministry of Transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gala|first=Ahmed|title=Welfare Impact of Telecom Reform in Egypt: An Ex Ante Analysis|year=1999|publisher=World Bank|editor=Samiha Fawzy and Ahmed Gala|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Via Law No.&amp;nbsp;19 of 1998, ARENTO  was renamed Telecom Egypt and turned into a joint stock company over which the government maintained full ownership.&lt;ref name="merisratings1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Rating &amp; Investor Service: Telecom Egypt S.A.E.|url=http://www.merisratings.com/UserFiles/File/Telecom%20Egypt%20Report.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225211441/http://www.merisratings.com/UserFiles/File/Telecom%20Egypt%20Report.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecom liberalization and Telecom Egypt===
Telecom Egypt replaced ARENTO in 1998 and the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Egypt)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]] was founded in order to develop Egypt's information and communications technology infrastructure.&lt;ref name="merisratings1"/&gt;  In 2001, Telecom Egypt established TE Data, a data and communications subsidiary.  In the same year, Telecom Egypt was awarded a license to begin mobile operations in Egypt but declined. Instead, TE purchased an 8.6% share in Vodafone Egypt in 2003. Telecom Egypt gradually increased their holdings in Vodafone Egypt until the end of 2008, when their share was 44.95%. Today, Vodafone Egypt represents a significant source of revenue for Telecom Egypt.&lt;ref name="nbkcapital1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecom Egypt: Day by Day Tactics|url=http://www.nbkcapital.com/BR/Research/MER/Telecom%20Sector/Egypt/Telecom%20Egypt/NBK%20Capital-Telecom%20Egypt%20Initiation%20of%20Coverage-22Dec.2009.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220155644/http://nbkcapital.com/BR/Research/MER/Telecom%20Sector/Egypt/Telecom%20Egypt/NBK%20Capital-Telecom%20Egypt%20Initiation%20of%20Coverage-22Dec.2009.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the Egyptian government launched an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] of 20% of Telecom Egypt's existing share capital. In 2006, the National Telecom Regulatory Authority (NTRA) deregulated Telecom Egypt's monopoly over domestic and international telephone service, and announced the potential for another fixed-line operator.  This initiative was put on hold due to economic pressure, and Telecom Egypt is still Egypt's only fixed line operator.&lt;ref name="nbkcapital1"/&gt;

Due to the government's 80% share in the company, Telecom Egypt is beholden to the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) for all major decisions concerning finances, tariffs and employment.  The MCIT is seen by some to exert control over the National Telecom Regulatory Authority, leading to potential conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Competitiveness and Private Sector Development: Egypt|year=2010|publisher=OECD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMFXAhLlaMYC&amp;pg=PA104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New unified licence means Telecom Egypt likely to break relationship with Vodafone, says CEO|year=2014|publisher=Global Telecoms Business |url=http://www.globaltelecomsbusiness.com/Article/3351421/Interviews/25239/New-unified-licence-means-Telecom-Egypt-likely-to-break-relationship-with-Vodafone-says-CEO.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in May–June 2014, Telecom Egypt's CEO said that the company was awarded a unified telecoms licence in April 2014, but he said that this would lead to a change in the relationship with Vodafone Egypt, in which Telecom Egypt has a stake of just under 45%. Telecom Egypt will be able to offer mobile services under the terms of the new licence, he said, and will be using new 4G spectrum from 2015, and that would lead to a break-up of the relationship with [[Vodafone]], by Telecom Egypt either buying the rest of the Vodafone Egypt stake or selling its stake to the Vodafone group.

==Products and services==
Telecom Egypt is Egypt's only fixed-line operator, and one of the largest in the [[MENA]] region with over 9 million subscribers as of 2009.  The company offers services in two categories, retail and wholesale.  On the retail side, Telecom Egypt offers access and voice services for home and enterprises and data services through TE Data. TE Data had a 61% market share in Egypt in 2009 and also operates in [[Jordan]]. TE Data offers additional services through a collaboration with the [[Microsoft Live]] platform.  Telecom Egypt is Egypt's only supplier of wholesale services.  The company leases broadband capacity as well as national and international interconnection services in both data and voice.  Telecom Egypt also provides infrastructure and transport services, voice and data services, and hosting.  Whole services accounted for 42% of revenues in 2009. Telecom Egypt also offers mobile services through its stake in Vodafone Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Report: Egypt 2010|year=2010|publisher=Oxford Business Group|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyTZkEUNIHoC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=telecom+egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=koR6T-mcFqLy0gHLtayfBg&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=telecom%20egypt&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, Telecom Egypt has a public monopoly over fixed landlines, provides 70% of internet service in Egypt, is the only provider of international phone service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hussein|first=Marwa|title=Telecom Egypt employees escalate their protest, demanding release of 5 colleagues|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/24500.aspx|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=Al Ahram Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides connectivity to all mobile operators.&lt;ref name="nbkcapital1"/&gt;  Though Telecom Egypt has recently applied to be a virtual network operator of mobile services in Egypt, perceived market domination might prevent a direct entry into the mobile phone market.

===Retail services===
Telecom Egypt offers fixed-line voice services and mobile through their partnership with Vodafone Egypt.  They offer broadband internet and [[IPTV]] services as well as "enterprise-managed internet access, managed network services, and outsourcing of information and communication technologies services".&lt;ref name="nbkcapital1"/&gt;

===Wholesale===
Telecom Egypt offers wholesale services to domestic and international customers. &lt;ref name="nbkcapital1"/&gt;  Internationally, Telecom Egypt is becoming a telecommunications and data hub between Asia, Africa, and Western Europe.  The TE North cable, built in collaboration with [[Alcatel-Lucent]], is a 40G undersea cable that connects [[Abu Talat, Egypt]], to [[Marseille]], [[France]], with branches to Jordan, Cyprus and branching units to be used for further expansion.  It began operation in mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alcatel-Lucent helps Telecom Egypt to put first 40G Mediterranean system in service|url=http://www.telecomindiaonline.com/alcatel-lucent-helps-telecom-egypt-to-put-first-40g-mediterranean-system-in-service.html|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===2011 shutdown===
Just after midnight on January 28, Egypt's international data connections were shut down in 25 minutes.  Telecom Egypt, as one of the five major network providers in Egypt, and the owner of "virtually all the country's fiber-optic cables" was instrumental in the government's shutdown.  The government also used its hold over Telecom Egypt's infrastructure to leverage providers like Vodafone Egypt into shutting down their services.  If these companies did not shut down independently, the reversal of the government's method of blocking their services would've taken more time to reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Leaders Found ‘Off’ Switch for Internet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/technology/16internet.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 15, 2011|author=James Glanz|author2=John Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, a lawsuit was brought to the High Administrative Court seeking damages from three telecommunications companies (including Telecom Egypt) as well as current and former officials.  The verdict eventually reached, which held accountable officials but not companies, stated that the internet shutdown had been practiced as early as April 2008, during the [[2008 Egyptian general strike|Mahalla Al Kobra protests]] in conjunction with telecom companies and ISPs in Egypt, and again in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=El-Wardani|first=Salma|title=Outrage over exoneration of Egypt telecom giants in communications shutdowns|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/13296.aspx|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=[[Al-Ahram]] Online|date=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the shutdown, mobile operators' networks, including Vodafone Egypt's, were hijacked by the Egyptian government in order to send text messages directly to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Intrudes On Mobile Operators|url=http://www.tectrends.com/tectrends/article/00178752.html|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=February 4, 2011|author=Paul Sonne|author2=Max Colchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 sit In===
On October 12, 2011, five Telecom Egypt employees were detained by police and charged with attempted murder of the company's CEO Mohamed Abdel Rahim.  According to protestors, the CEO visited the offices and employees gathered at his office to present demands associated with working conditions at Telecom Egypt.  After he refused to hear their demands, they staged a sit-in in front of his office, which eventually ended when military police cut into his office from an adjacent room.

Protestors organized a protest and strike calling for the release of their co-workers. Telephone directory services and the Telecom Egypt service hotline were shut down in protest as well.  The protestors claimed that Abdel Rahim and the board of directors were responsible for corruption and called for their resignation as well as the revision of high officials' salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hussein|first=Marwa|title=Telecom Egypt employees escalate their protest, demanding release of 5 colleagues|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/24500.aspx|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=Al Ahram Online|date=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2011, the head of the independent workers union of Telecom Egypt, Mohamed Abu Karish, said that the prisoners would be released and disputed claims that workers threatened to shut down internet and communication services as an attempt to undermine the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Al-Lakani|first=Adel|title=Telecom Egypt workers should see colleagues released soon|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/24836.aspx|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=Al Ahram Online|date=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abdel Rahim withdrew his murder accusation and the detainees were set free on October 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Megahed|first=Mohamed|title=Telecom Egypt CEO withdraws attempted murder accusation|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/508513|accessdate=3 April 2012|newspaper=Al Masry Al Youm English Online|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
