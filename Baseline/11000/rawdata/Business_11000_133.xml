'''ABC Stores''' is a  chain of [[convenience store]]s based in [[Honolulu]] owned by MNS Ltd. The chain operates 73 stores, 57 of which are located in the state of [[Hawaii]], with the remaining locations in the [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Las Vegas]]. The company now generates more than $230 million in annual profits and employs over 1500 staff, and is described as the 37th largest company in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=ABCExpandswithDukesLane&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/September-2017/ABC-Stores-Ventures-into-Upscale-Dining-with-Dukes-Lane-Market-and-Eatery/|title=ABC Stores Ventures into Upscale Dining with Dukes Lane Market &amp; Eatery|work=[[Honolulu Magazine]]|date=September 26, 2017|author=Mari Taketa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also has 7 stores operating under the Island Deli brand, with a focus on groceries and fresh foods.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abcstores.com/island-deli-hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 they opened a restaurant and [[food hall]] known as the Dukes Lane Eatery in Waikiki.&lt;ref name="ABCExpandswithDukesLane" /&gt;

==Products==
The stores sell convenience items such as groceries, as well as tourist items and [[souvenir]]s. The chain's best-selling items are tourist-oriented products such as [[Macadamia nuts]], [[sunscreen]] and [[sunglasses]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==
The chain was started by Sidney Kosasa, who opened his first store in [[Waikiki]] in 1964.  The stores were originally named "Mister K."  Later, in order to make the store name easier to remember, the name of the stores were changed to "ABC Stores." The last Mister K was changed to ABC in 2009.

The son of a first generation Japanese immigrant, Sidney Kosasa (or rather ‘Mr. K’-  known by his ABC Stores ‘Ohana’ or family) was born in Palolo Valley, Hawaii in December 1919.  His first experiences in retail began while working in his parents’ grocery store in [[Palolo, Hawaii|Palolo]].

In 1949, Mr. and Mrs. K. opened their first pharmacy/convenience store in Kaimuki, Hawaii – known later as Thrifty Drugs.  As business grew, his entrepreneurial and business philosophies resulted in the opening of four locations within 10 years. While attending a business convention in Miami Beach, Florida, Mr. K noticed all the tourists near the large hotels and had a vision to build a chain of resort stores in Hawaii. The first ABC Store was opened on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki, Hawaii in 1964.

==Locations==
The stores are now ubiquitous in the tourist-oriented Waikiki neighborhood. There are 35 store locations within a one-mile radius of Waikiki alone and consequently many of these sit in close proximity to one another. The intersection of Kalakaua and Seaside Avenue alone has four ABC Stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595068073,00.html|title=Ubiquitous ABC Stores score well with Hawaiian tourists|last=Song|first=Jaymes|work=Deseret Morning News|date=2004-06-04|accessdate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many retail analysts believe this is an attempt to block other convenience stores from entering the Waikiki market and thus prevent competition{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In total, there are 37 stores on [[O'ahu]], 12 on [[Maui]], five on [[Hawaii (island)|The Big Island]] and three on [[Kauai]].

There are eight stores in [[Las Vegas]], currently the franchise's only [[Mainland United States|mainland]] location.

There are also ten stores in the [[Mariana Islands]], eight in [[Guam]] (in [[Tumon]]) and two in [[Saipan]] (in [[Garapan]]).

'''AGV''' ('''A'''misano '''G'''ino '''V'''alenza) is an Italian [[motorcycle helmet]] firm, founded in 1946 by [[Gino Amisano]] (1920&amp;ndash;2009). AGV is known for its use of innovative designs and materials, tested on the racetrack and developed with sponsored World Championship riders, including 9-time World Champion [[Valentino Rossi]]. The company was purchased by Italian dynamic sport clothing company [[Dainese]] in July 2007.&lt;ref name=visordown&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.visordown.com/news/general/dainese-buy-helmet-brand-agv | publisher= Visor Down | title= Dainese buy helmet brand AGV | date=  15 August 2007 | accessdate= 29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product range==
AGV produces an extensive range of motorcycle helmets, from full-face racing, sport, touring and off-road models to modular helmets, urban jet helmets and open-face cruiser designs in a spectrum of materials from carbon fiber to [[aramid]], [[fiberglass]] and [[thermoplastics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AGV Product Range|url = https://www.agv.com/row/en/home/|accessdate = 2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All current AGV helmets are developed to AGV Extreme Standards, an integrated technical development and construction approach that “designs around the head” and which the company claims achieves tangible and measurable improvements in protection, fit, comfort, reliability and environmental impact.&lt;ref name=esh&gt;{{Cite web|title = AGV Extreme Standards|url = https://www.agv.com/row_en/extreme-standards/|accessdate = 2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
AGV was founded in 1946 by [[Gino Amisano]] (1920–2009). The company name is an acronym of his own name and the town, [[Valenza]], where the company was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AGV About Us|url = https://www.agv.com/row_en/about-us/|accessdate = 2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company logotype incorporates the acronym within a helmet shape bearing the colors of the Italian flag. Amisano liked to joke that this simple profile was how other riders always saw the helmet of his most famous rider, Giacomo Agostini, on the racetrack: from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AGV X3000|url = https://www.agv.com/row_en/legends-x3000/|accessdate = 2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGV initially made leather seats and motorcycle saddles, adding leather [[motorcycle helmet]]s a year later, in 1947.&lt;ref name=revzilla&gt;{{Cite web|title = AGV Helmets History|url = http://www.revzilla.com/agv-helmets-history|accessdate = 2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite a number of innovations, helmet production only came to the fore with the advent of the fiberglass helmet in 1954.&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; This marked the beginning of decades of collaboration with the world’s top motorcycle racers, including [[Kenny Roberts]],&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; [[Barry Sheene]],&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; [[Johnny Cecotto]],&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; [[Steve Baker (motorcyclist)|Steve Baker]],&lt;ref name=moto.it&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.moto.it/news/agv-gino-amisano-in-mostra-a-valenza.html | publisher= Moto.it | title= AGV e Gino Amisano in mostra a Valenza | date=  19 December 2012 | accessdate= 29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angel Nieto]],&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; 15-time World Championship Winner [[Giacomo Agostini]]&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; and most recently [[Valentino Rossi]],&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; with both the latter having used AGV helmets throughout their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rossi Helmets|url = http://rossihelmets.com/|accessdate = 2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was quick to capitalize on its racing prominence and was the first to use a motorcycle race for its advertising, having banners hung around the most-photographed track bends.&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; AGV was likewise a pioneer in the use of product placement in the movies, including [[A Place for Lovers|''A place for lovers'']] by [[Vittorio De Sica|De Sica]], starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]].&lt;ref name=motociclismo&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.motociclismo.it/dainese-agv-story-foto-archivio-motociclismo-115-anni-passione-abbigliamento-caschi-sicurezza-tecnologia-innovazione-vol-2-67960 | publisher= Motociclismo | title= Dainese e AGV: 115 anni di passione (vol. 2) | date=  25 July 2017 | accessdate= 29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGV moved into [[Formula One]] from the early seventies, sponsoring drivers such as [[Niki Lauda]],&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt;, [[Keke Rosberg]]&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt; and [[Nelson Piquet]].&lt;ref name=revzilla/&gt;

Valentino Rossi was made an honorary president of the company in 2008.&lt;ref name=londonbikers&gt;{{cite news | url= http://londonbikers.com/news/9716/tavullias-valentino-rossi-becomes-agv-honorary-president | publisher= London Bikers | title= Tavullia's Valentino Rossi Becomes AGV Honorary President | date=  2 September 2008 | accessdate= 24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGV Helmets was purchased by Italian dynamic sports clothing company [[Dainese]] in July 2007.&lt;ref name=visordown/&gt; Dainese was acquired by [[Investcorp]] of [[Bahrain]] for €130 million in 2014.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dainese-m-a-investcorp-bank/investcorp-buys-protective-clothing-maker-dainese-for-163-million-idUSKBN0IP10P20141105 | publisher= Reuters | title= Investcorp buys protective clothing maker Dainese for $163 million | date=  5 November 2014 | accessdate= 29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ARGO SpA''' is a family-owned Italian [[holding company]] owned by the Morra family that manufactures agricultural equipment.

==History and growth==
It was founded by Valerio Morra in 1980 with his purchase of '''MBS Spa'''. In 1987, ARGO purchased [[Pegoraro]] Spa of [[Vicenza]]. Sixty-six percent of [[Landini (tractor)|Landini]] was purchased in 1989 from [[Massey Ferguson]], with additional shares purchased in 1994. In 1995, the tractor business was expanded with the purchase of [[Valpadana]] Spa, followed by [[S.E.P. SpA|S.E.P.]] Spa and [[Laverda (harvesters)|Laverda]] in 2000 from [[CNH Global]].  S.E.P. manufactures small, specialty tractors and equipment, while Laverda manufactures combines and hay-equipment.  The remaining 9% of Landini that was owned by [[AGCO]] was purchased by ARGO in 2000.  2001 saw further growth with the purchase of the [[McCormick Tractors|McCormick]] name and tractor factory in [[Doncaster]], [[England]], after the [[merger]] of [[Case IH]] and [[Fiat]]'s [[New Holland Ag]] into [[CNH Global]].  The regulatory bodies reviewing the merger required some factories to be sold, which included [[Laverda (harvesters)|Laverda]] from [[Fiat]], and [[McCormick Tractors|McCormick Tractors International]] from [[Case IH]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argospa.com/storia3.html Page 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113085341/http://www.argospa.com/storia3.html |date=January 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007 saw ARGO selling 50% of Laverda to [[AGCO]]. AGCO bought the remaining 50% of Laverda in late 2010/early 2011, thereby also acquiring [[Fella-Werke]].

==Brands==
ARGO manufactures or distributes the following brands of primarily agricultural equipment:
* [[Landini (tractor)|Landini]]
* [[McCormick Tractors|McCormick]]
* [[Valpadana]]
* [[S.E.P. SpA|S.E.P.]]
* [[Pegoraro]]

Bal Falcone has just been nominated by the DPP (and humbly accepted) as its Senatoriable Candidate to the coming National Elections.
*'''Executive Director''': Sagip Bansa Filipinas Foundation Inc., an NGO dedicated to helping provide jobs and houses and lots to the poorest of the poor in Philippine society. Starting last year to put into actual action this advocacy, Sagip Bansa with the acquiescence of the Spartan Mining and Development Corporation of DPP’s Chairman Luis G. Ramos has provided decent and well paying jobs (hand-magnetizing iron sand) to more than a thousand displaced Aetas around Mt. Pinatubo while preparing to provide jobs and homes (200&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lots with 50&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; houses for each family) to the thousands of families and informal settlers of Metro Manila (Smokey Mountain, Payatas, Farola, North Triangle, Baseco etc.) collocating them decently in Brgy. Villar, Botolan Zambales. In this regard, he has led efforts to the securitization of this project which will create a new city (tentatively captioned “Magnificat City”) of the poor, for the poor, and by the poor empowering themselves towards decent sufficiency, while at the same time restoring Manila to its original grandeur, of which great Filipino writer Nick Joaquin constantly exulted.
President. Millennium Industrial Commercial Corporation (MICC),a Cebu-based company.
*'''Vice-President''': Global Interphase Security Services Provider Inc. (or GISSPI), a Filipino firm dedicated to providing good foreign assignments to retired officers, soldiers and army men; together with ADI / Arch. Designers Inc., and Nippon Steel of Japan projects the transformation of Laguna Lake and surrounding areas into key tourism towns and destinations worthy of global admiration.

==Special Skills==
*'''Securitization''': the ability/special know-how (he learned from special tutors here and abroad) to create Asset Pool Trusts with selected banks to raise from the Trust departments of banks and high-net-worth individuals and juridical entities critical capital funds for viable projects through domestic and international bond flotation enhanced by third party guarantors/ insurers. (Unknown to many, the combined trust money in the Trust Department of Philippine Banks now amounts to close to Three (3) Trillions Pesos. The major monetary instrument / access tool to these inefficiently and unequitably utilized funds (a luxurious plaything of the few rich, comfortable and powerful) is Securitization. Bal Cordero Falcone can initiate the Securitization of Viable Projects in each city and province to increase the provincial revenues (besides its IRA) as well as solve the unemployment problem of each province city and town.

[[Image:Big Oil.svg|thumb|right|Chart of the major [[energy]] companies dubbed "Big Oil" sorted by 2005 revenue]]

'''Big Oil''' is a name used to describe the world's six or seven largest [[List of corporations by market capitalization#Publicly traded companies|publicly traded]] [[list of oil companies|oil and gas companies]], also known as '''supermajors'''.&lt;ref name=reut1808&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/01/us-oilmajors-production-idUSL169721220080801|title=Oil majors' output growth hinges on strategy shift|accessdate=28 April 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt2206&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02iht-shell.html|title=Shell will invest despite decline in earnings|accessdate=28 April 2011|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bw29906&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-12-11/conocophillips-the-making-of-an-oil-major|accessdate=2016-04-01|title=ConocoPhillips: The Making Of An Oil Major|date=12 December 2005|work=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nafta - Volume 56 - Page 447  2005 "Tom Nicholls, editor, Petroleum Economist, writes WHOEVER coined the term supermajor should have kept some superlatives in reserve.

The term, analogous to others, such as [[Big Steel]], that describe industries dominated by a few giant corporations, was popularized in print from the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate Packaging Management C.

In the [[Merchant navy|maritime]] industry, six to seven large oil companies that decide a majority of the [[crude oil tanker]] [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] business are called '''"Oil Majors"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TEN wins long-term suezmax charter with an oil major|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/tankers/article474631.ece|accessdate=6 December 2015|publisher=Lloyds List|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of the supermajors traces back to the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]", the seven oil companies which formed the "[[Consortium for Iran]]" cartel and dominated the global [[petroleum industry]] from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/471ae1b8-d001-11db-94cb-000b5df10621.html The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals], by Carola Hoyos, Financial Times. 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946053-1,00.html|title=Business: The Seven Sisters Still Rule|accessdate=24 October 2010|publisher=Time|date=11 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seven Sisters were:
* [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (now [[BP]]);
* [[Gulf Oil]], [[Standard Oil of California|Standard Oil of California (Socal)]] and [[Texaco]] (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]);
* [[Royal Dutch Shell]]; and
* [[Standard Oil of New Jersey|Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso)]] and [[Standard Oil Company of New York|Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony)]] (now [[ExxonMobil]]).
Before the [[oil crisis of 1973]] the members of the Seven Sisters controlled around 85% of the world's [[oil reserves]].
The supermajors began to emerge in the late-1990s, in response to a severe fall in [[oil prices]]. Large petroleum companies began to merge, often in an effort to improve [[economies of scale]], hedge against oil [[volatility (finance)|price volatility]], and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec98/oil_12-1.html
|title=Slick Deal?
|publisher=''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]''
|date=1998-12-01
|accessdate=2007-08-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The following major mergers and acquisitions of oil and gas companies took place between 1998 and 2002:
* Exxon's merger with [[Mobil]] in 1999, forming ExxonMobil;
* Total's merger with [[Petrofina]] in 1999 and with [[Elf Aquitaine]] in 2000, with the resulting company subsequently renamed Total S.A.;
* BP's acquisitions of [[Amoco]] in 1998 and of [[ARCO]] in 2000;
* Chevron's acquisition of [[Texaco]] in 2001;
* the merger of [[Conoco Inc.]] and [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] in 2002, forming [[ConocoPhillips]].
This process of consolidation created some of the largest global corporations as defined by the [[Forbes Global 2000]] ranking, and as of 2007 all were within the top 25. Between 2004 and 2007 the profits of the six supermajors totaled US$494.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2008/ Global 500], ''Fortune'' website, accessed Aug. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Trading under various names around the world, the supermajors are considered to be:&lt;ref name=reut1808/&gt;

* [[BP|BP plc]] ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[Chevron Corporation]] ([[United States]])
* [[Eni|Eni SpA]] ([[Italy]])
* [[ExxonMobil|ExxonMobil Corporation]] ([[United States]])
* [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch Shell plc]] ([[Netherlands]] and [[United Kingdom]])
* [[Total SA]] ([[France]])

[[ConocoPhillips Company]] ([[United States]]) was also sometimes described as forming part of the group,&lt;ref name=bw29906/&gt; before the Downstream activities spin-off. As of 2011 ExxonMobil ranked first among the supermajors measured by market capitalization, cash flow and profits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbes Global 2000#2011 list|Forbes Global 2000 – 2011 list]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of corporations by market capitalization#Publicly traded companies|FT list of top Publicly Traded companies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, the supermajors control around 6% of global [[Oil reserves|oil]] and [[Gas reserves|gas]] reserves. Conversely, 88% of global oil and gas reserves are controlled by the [[OPEC]] [[cartel]] and [[National oil company|state-owned oil companies]], primarily located in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Energy Information Administration | title=Who are the major players supplying the world oil market? | year=2009 | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/energy_in_brief/world_oil_market.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trend of increasing influence of the OPEC cartel, state-owned oil companies&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article272352.ece|title=Shaky industry that runs the world|accessdate=26 October 2010|publisher=The Times (South Africa)|date=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in emerging-market economies is shown and the ''[[Financial Times]]'' has used the label "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)#The New Seven Sisters|The New Seven Sisters]]" to refer to a group of what it argues are the most influential national oil and gas companies based in countries outside of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], namely [[China National Petroleum Corporation|CNPC]] ''(China)'', [[Gazprom]] ''(Russia)'', [[National Iranian Oil Company]] ''(Iran)'', [[Petrobras]] ''(Brazil)'', [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|PDVSA]] ''(Venezuela)'', [[Petronas]] ''(Malaysia)'', [[Saudi Aramco]] ''(Saudi Arabia)''.&lt;ref name="NSS-01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ypenergy.org/history/ |title=New and Old Leaders in the Upstream Oil Industry |accessdate=20 Jan 2012 |publisher=ypenergy.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222183241/http://www.ypenergy.org/history/ |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSS-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warregoenergy.com/story/documents/FT%20The%20New%20Seven%20Sisters.pdf|title=FT – New and Old Leaders in the Upstream Oil Industry|accessdate=20 Jan 2012|publisher=FT|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Big oil"==
Petroleum and [[natural gas|gas]] supermajors are sometimes collectively referred to as "Big oil", a term that emphasizes their economic power and perceived influence on politics, particularly in the United States. Big oil is often associated with the [[fossil fuels lobby]].

Usually used to refer to the industry as a whole in a pejorative or derogatory manner, "Big oil" has come to encompass the enormous impact crude oil exerts over first-world industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920328,00.html Inside the Big Oil Game] at Time&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime "Oil Majors"==
In the maritime industry, a group of six companies that control the chartering of the majority of oil tankers worldwide are together referred to as '''"Oil Majors"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of an ‘Oil major’ and ‘Recognised Oil Majors’|url=http://www.lawandsea.net/CP_Time/Charterparty_Time_Majors_Approval_2Meaning_of_Oil_major.html|website=www.lawandsea.net|publisher=Law and the sea|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are: [[Shell Oil|Royal Dutch Shell]], [[BP]], [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Texaco]], [[Total Fina Elf]] and [[ConocoPhillips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolphin Tanker Srl v Westport Petroleum Inc (The Savina Caylyn) [2010] EWHC 2617 (Comm)|url=http://www.lawandsea.net|website=www.lawandsea.net|publisher=Law and sea|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helman|first1=Christopher|title=The World's Biggest Oil And Gas Companies - 2015|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/03/19/the-worlds-biggest-oil-and-gas-companies/|accessdate=6 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charter-party|Charter parties]] such as "Shelltime 4" frequently mention the phrase "oil major".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McInnes|first1=David|title=Legal aspects of oil major approvals in oil tanker charter parties|url=http://www.lmaa.london|website=www.lmaa.london|publisher=Ince &amp; Co.|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big business''' involves large-scale corporate-controlled [[financial market|financial]] or [[business sector|business]] activities. As a term, it describes activities that run from "huge transactions" to the more general "doing big things". The concept first rose in a symbolic sense after 1880 in connection with the combination movement that began in American [[commerce|business]] at that time.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} United States corporations that fall into the category of "big business" {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} include [[ExxonMobil]], [[Walmart]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[General Electric]], [[General Motors]], [[Citigroup]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[JPMorgan Chase]]. The largest German corporations {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} included [[Daimler AG]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Siemens]], and [[Deutsche Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes.com. [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/183/Rank_1.html "The Largest German Companies."] Accessed 2012-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the largest companies in the United Kingdom {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} are [[HSBC]], [[Barclays]], [[WPP plc]], and [[BP]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes.com. [https://www.forbes.com/2006/12/02/forbes40-hsbc-hbos-biz-cx_pm_1205uk40_intro.html "The U.K.'s 40 Largest Companies."] Accessed 2012-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter half of the 19th century saw more technological advances and corporate growth in additional{{clarify|date=June 2015}} sectors, such as [[Petroleum industry|petroleum]], [[Machinery industry|machinery]], [[Chemical manufacturing|chemicals]], and [[Electrification|electrical equipment]]. (See [[Second Industrial Revolution]].)

==History==
===Early 20th century===
The [[automotive industry]] began modestly in the late-19th century, but grew rapidly following the development of large-scale [[gasoline]] production in the early 20th century.

====Post-World War II====
The relatively stable period of rebuilding after [[World War II]] led to new technologies (some of which were spin-offs from the war years) and new businesses.

=====Computers=====
The new technology of [[computer]]s spread worldwide in the post war years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Businesses built around computer technology include: [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Samsung]], and [[Intel]].

=====Electronics=====
Miniaturization and [[integrated circuit]]s, together with an expansion of [[radio]] and [[television]] technologies, provided fertile ground for business development. Electronics businesses include [[JVC]], [[Sony]] ([[Masaru Ibuka]] and [[Akio Morita]]), and [[Texas Instruments]] ([[Cecil H. Green]], [[J. Erik Jonsson]], [[Eugene McDermott]], and Patrick E. Chodery), while also the companies in the computer-section above can be considered electronics.

=====Energy=====
[[Nuclear power]] was added to [[fossil fuel]] as the main sources of energy.

==Criticism of big business==
The social consequences of the concentration of economic power in the hands of those persons controlling "big business" has been a constant concern both of [[economist]]s and of [[politician]]s since the end of the 19th century.  Various attempts have been made to investigate the effects of "bigness" upon labor, consumers, and investors, as well as upon prices and [[competition]]. "Big business" has been accused of a wide variety of misdeeds that range from the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the [[working class]] to the [[Political corruption|corruption]] of politicians and the fomenting of [[war]].

===Influence over government===
Corporate concentration can lead to influence over government in areas such as tax policy, trade policy, environmental policy, foreign policy, and labor policy through [[lobbying]]. In 2005, the majority of Americans believed that big business has "too much power in Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.cato.org/research/articles/cpr28n4-1.html

'''Brembo S.p.A.''' is an Italian manufacturer of [[automotive industry|automotive]] [[brake]] systems, especially for [[high performance vehicle|high-performance cars]] and [[motorcycle]]s based in [[Bergamo]], near [[Milan]].
[[File:Brembo azienda presso kilometro rosso.jpg|thumb|Brembo plant]]

==History==
Brembo was established in Bergamo, Italy in 1961. Soon after the company was formed, it specialised in [[disc brake]]s, which were imported from the UK at the time. The company entered into a supply contract with [[Alfa Romeo]] in 1964. It became the supplier of brake components to [[Moto Guzzi]] in 1966.

In the 1980s, Brembo began supplying [[BMW]], [[Chrysler]], [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Nissan]], and [[Porsche]] with brakes. The company went public on the [[Milan Stock Exchange]] in 1995.

Corporate headquarters are located in Bergamo, and the company has more than 9,000 employees within Italy and at branches in Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, US, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.

In 2000 Brembo purchased the UK-based racing brake and clutch manufacturer AP Racing (a former division of [[Automotive Products]]).

On November 9, 2007, the Automotive Brake Components division of Hayes Lemmerz was acquired by Brembo's North American subsidiary. The approximately €39.6 million sale included production facilities in Homer, Michigan and Apodaca, Mexico and approximately 250 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brembo and Hayes Lemmerz complete sale of Hayes Lemmerz’ Automotive Brake Component division to Brembo North America|url=http://www.brembo.com/en/Press/Comunicati-stampa/Documents/Comunicati%20Stampa%202007/Brembo-HayesLemmerz_09-11-2007.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2015|date=9 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402170647/http://www.brembo.com/en/Press/Comunicati-stampa/Documents/Comunicati%20Stampa%202007/Brembo-HayesLemmerz_09-11-2007.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official press release on May 21, 2014 announced an €83 million expansion of the Michigan facility. On December 2, 2014, Brembo announced plans to invest €32 million into a 31,500 square meter production facility, which is projected to produce 2 million aluminum calipers yearly. The current expectation is initial operation beginning in 2016 and full operation by the end of 2018.&lt;ref name=mexico_acq&gt;{{cite web|title=BREMBO TO INVEST $39 MILLION (€32 MILLION) FOR A NEW ALUMINUM CALIPER PRODUCTION PLANT IN MEXICO|url=http://www.brembo.com/en/Press/Comunicati-stampa/Documents/Comunicati%20Stampa%202014/2014%2012%2002%20Brembo_new%20plant%20in%20Mexico_ENG.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2015|date=2 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143636/http://www.brembo.com/en/Press/Comunicati-stampa/Documents/Comunicati%20Stampa%202014/2014%2012%2002%20Brembo_new%20plant%20in%20Mexico_ENG.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brembo's deputy chairman Matteo Tiraboschi reported on March 5, 2015 the company's 2014 sales growth of 15% up to €1.8 billion, and a net profit increase of 45% to €129.1 million. He also reported that possibilities for acquiring assets were being explored, with focus on the automotive and aviation sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Agnieszka Flak|title=Brembo sees 2015 sales growing, looking at M&amp;A|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/brembo-results-outlook-idUSL5N0W74ET20150305|accessdate=15 March 2015|work=Reuters|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication quotient''', '''communication intelligence''', or '''CQ''' is a [[Business philosophy|theory]] that [[communication]] is a [[behaviour]] based skill that can be measured and trained.  CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another.  The first scholarly article referring to CQ was by Robert Service in CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals.  The article was published in 2005 in the Journal of [[Information Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 at [[TED conference|TED]] Women, Clare Munn spoke about the importance of our Communication Quotient in an increasingly digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|url=http://www.tedwomen.aol.com/2010/10/03/clare-munn/|work=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|publisher=TEDWomen|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of CQ as a theory and a concept can be traced back to the challenging of [[IQ]] as fully explaining cognitive ability in 1983, by [[Howard Gardner]] with his [[Theory of multiple intelligences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|url=https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465025102|work=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|publisher=New York|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gardner's view, traditional types of [[intelligence]], such as IQ, fail to fully explain [[cognitive ability]].  The development of CQ is part of the trend to analyse and fully understand [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], a trend led by [[Daniel Goleman]]’s [[emotional intelligence]] and social intelligence.

==Definition==
''[[The Times of India]]'' in 2005 , in an article entitled A Shift from IQ, referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were testing for amongst Indian graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shift from IQ|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/A-Shift-from-IQ/articleshow/1010684.cms|work=A Shift from IQ|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=Improving Your Communication Quotient|url=http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/CQ.htm.|work=Improving Your Communication Quotient|publisher=Expressions of Excellence|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Clare Munn and [[Maria Bello]] defined CQ as "Expressive &amp; Receptive Intelligence" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Social Media's Value Proposition Might Just be CQ|url=http://claremunn.com/2009/04/cq-social-medias-value-proposition/|work=CQ: Expressive and Receptive Intelligence|publisher=Clare Munn|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in ''The CQ Manifesto'' defined CQ as  "saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Institute - What is CQ?|url=http://www.cqinstitute.com/CQ/what_is_cq.htm|work=The CQ Manifesto - Communication Intelligence: the 5 professional personas that will transform your work life and super-charge your organisation|publisher=CQ Institute|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robert Service’s 2005 article he presented the communication quotient as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals.  Service argues that the improvement of communication ability will allow individuals the opportunity to move up in the organisational ranks.  The article presents two models to explain communication, the first is the model of two-way communications and the second is the CQ measurement and improvement matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Thomas Bussau''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (born 10 November 1940) is a pioneer of [[microfinance]], having founded [[Opportunity International Australia]] and co-founded the [[Opportunity International]] Network. He has been hailed for his innovative approach to solving world [[poverty]] by challenging the conventional wealth distribution model of [[international development|development]], addressing the root causes of poverty through responsible wealth creation.

== Background ==
A successful [[entrepreneur]] himself, Bussau started life in an Anglican boys’ home and launched his business career at the age of 15 with a rented hotdog stand. Twenty years later, and with numerous successful businesses to his credit, he "retired", having reached what he refers to as the "economics of enough".&lt;ref&gt;Don't Look Back, Philippa Tyndale, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, answering a call for help, Bussau moved his family which includes Carol, his wife, and Natasha and Rachel, his two daughters,  to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and headed up a national movement to assist the victims of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. Soon after, he began [[aid]] work in [[Indonesia]] and eventually endowed a private foundation committed to responsible wealth creation and entrepreneurship, believing this is the best way to alleviate global [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.femail.com.au/david_bussau.htm [Femail Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding Opportunity International ==
Challenging conventional thinking that poverty is inevitable and hopeless, Bussau's work illustrates his belief that there are many creative and talented poor people and all they need is an opportunity. Recognising that the key to building any small business is access to credit, [[Opportunity International]] has been active for over 35 years and [[Opportunity International Australia]] currently serves over a million clients and is focused on three main countries: [[Indonesia]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opportunity.org.au Opportunity International Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Now retired from [[Opportunity International]], Bussau continues his work by providing consultancy services to [[governments]], multinationals and other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/closeup/giving_credit.cfm AusAID]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Bussau has been recognised for the work he has done in the [[international development]] sector: chosen by The Bulletin magazine "as one of Australia’s 10 most creative minds"; awarded the [[Order of Australia]] for services to international development; named the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year/Entrepreneur-of-The-Year---SEOY---David-Bussau Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently awarded Senior [[Australian of the Year]] 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/pages/page392.asp Australian of the Year 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''De Simon Group S.p.A.''' is a [[bus manufacturer]] and [[coachbuilder]] based in [[Osoppo]], [[Udine]], [[Italy]].

==History==

[[File:Inbus 1702.jpg|thumb|Inbus U210 urban bus]]
[[File:INBUS AID 280 FT.jpg|thumb|Inbus AID 280 FT articulated bus]]

The company was founded in 1925 by Giovanni De Simon, who started assembling wooden-body buses for the local public transport. Later, under the management of his son Ilvo, the company introduced steel for interurban and touristic coaches, using [[Fiat]], [[Officine Meccaniche|OM]], [[Lancia]] or [[Alfa Romeo|Alfa]] chassis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anav.it/Data/BM200806/Pg0018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;http://www.desimon.it/index.php?op=12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixties they started assembling buses on Fiat truck-chassis and sold over a thousand units to the public transport companies in Italy.

The [[1976 Friuli earthquake]], with its epicenter in Osoppo, ruined most of the plants in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], including De Simon's. Ilvo with his sons Giovanni and Alvio managed to rebuild the plant in only two years' time. The new site covered 70,000 square meters and included two office buildings and a test track.

In 1978, De Simon together with [[Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie]] formed a new consortium called [[Inbus]], which in the 1980s achieved a 30% share of the national bus market. During this time, De Simon built a new construction plant in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], called IMEA, that would be the main supplier of the island for urban and interurban buses. During its ten years of existence the Inbus consortium produced about 6,000 buses, of which 30% were assembled by De Simon.

After the disbanding of the consortium in 1990, De Simon continued producing buses in collaboration with [[Iveco]] and [[Renault]], introducing for the first time in Italy the bodies built from stainless steel.

Starting in 1993, De Simon focussed mainly on intercity buses built entirely from stainless steel, using chassis from European manufacturers [[Scania AB|Scania]] and later [[Mercedes-Benz]]. In the urban sector, De Simon held a franchise to sell in Italy the buses of the Belgian manufacturer [[Van Hool]], between 8 and 18 meters in length, and available even with a [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas]]-powered engine.

Between 1996 and 2002, the Romanian bus manufacturer [[Rocar]] and De Simon had a cooperation for the assembly of 400 urban buses.

In the following five years the company developed a new range of buses called Millemiglia, designed for interurban lines, between 10.8 and 14 meters in length. Such fleets were for use in the towns of [[Apulia]] and [[Campania]]. Their line-up also included a touristic open-top bus called Millemiglia Zefiro.&lt;ref name="Lineup"&gt;http://www.desimon.it/index.php?op=123&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, De Simon Group established themselves as a [[joint-stock company]] mainly managing the supply of spare parts for bus bodies and repairs, maintenance, and conversion of bus bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desimon.it/index.php?op=7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, as an independent company, De Simon achieved a sales volume of 150 buses and a turnover of more than 20 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In [[French labour law|French Labour Law]] a '''[[Dismissal (employment)|Dismissal]]''' is the breach of the employment contract by the employer. French Labour Law stipulates that an employment contract can be terminated by either of the parties. The 2008 reform of Labour Law introduced the possibility of a negotiated termination ([[Voluntary redundancy|voluntary termination of employment]]).

==Types of Dismissal==

In France the following types of dismissal are possible:
Dismissal for economic reasons ([[Layoff|redundancy]]) - the dismissed person may not be replaced.
This type of dismissal can occur for the following reasons:
* Serious economic difficulty
* Technological change
* Organisational change 
* Liquidation of the company.
Dismissal linked to the employee - an employee dismissed will be replaced by another employee.
This covers the following areas:
* Not being able to do your job properly
* Due to serious differences with employer or colleagues
* Misconduct.

==Compensation==
===Statutory Compensation===
Statutory compensation is the legally binding minimum and may be replaced by a higher amount agreed between the employer and the employee representatives under a collective agreement. Employees who have held a position for more than 12 months are entitled to compensation for redundancy &amp; dismissal (except if they have been dismissed for Gross Misconduct).

The amount of compensation is one-fifth of the monthly salary (4.5 days), excluding one-time bonuses, per year of employment up to 10 years, {{frac|2|15}} per year thereafter. For example, a worker with a monthly salary of €1000 in his fifth year of employment would receive €200 compensation.

===Collective Compensation===
This replaces the statutory minimum if it exists. It is tax-free and no payroll tax applies.

===Claim for unfair dismissal or redundancy===
An employment tribunal can overturn a dismissal or redundancy.
If you win your case, the tribunal can order the employer to do any of the following:
*Pay compensation
*Pay tribunal fees and witness expenses you've paid
*Improve working conditions
*give the employee their job back.

The amount of compensation can depend on the number of employees in the company and their length of service and salary.

== Employees with special protection against dismissal and redundancy ==

The following employees are afforded special protection immediately prior to, during and after (up to 12 months) their mandate.

* Employee representatives
* Union representatives
* Employees serving in employment tribunals or bankruptcy courts

==See also==
*[[Redundancy in United Kingdom law]]
*[[Unfair dismissal]]
*[[Wrongful dismissal]]
*[[Constructive dismissal]]

[[File:Doffers in Aragon Mills. Rock Hill, S.C. - NARA - 523539.jpg|thumb|300px|Doffer boys in Aragon Mills, [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] on 13 May 1912]]
A '''doffer''' is someone who removes ("doffs") [[bobbin]]s, [[pirn]]s or [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s holding spun fiber such as cotton or wool from a [[spinning frame]] and replaces them with empty ones. Historically, spinners, doffers, and sweepers each had separate tasks that were required in the manufacture of [[Spinning (textiles)|spun textiles]]. From the early days of the industrial revolution, this work, which requires speed and dexterity rather than strength, was often done by children.{{sfn|Zonderman|1992|p=27}} After World War I, the practice of employing children declined, ending in the United States in 1933.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=183-185}} In modern textile mills, doffing machines have now replaced humans.{{sfn|Fourné|1999|p=596}}

==The 19th century== 
The [[Industrial Revolution]] created growing demand for child labor in the mills and factories, since children were easier to supervise than adults and good at monotonous, repetitive tasks that often required little physical strength, 
but where small bodies and nimble fingers were an advantage.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=58-59}} 

Children were employed in the mills as spinners, sweepers and doffers, with girls usually starting as spinners and boys as doffers and sweepers. When the bobbins on the spinning frames were full, the machinery stopped. The doffers would swarm into the mill and, as quickly as possible, change all the bobbins, after which the machinery would be restarted and the doffers were free to amuse themselves until the next change-over. On the newer and taller frames, the doffers often had to climb to reach the bobbins.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=474}}

===Great Britain===

In [[Lancashire]] the doffing boys were free to do what they liked once they had completed a doffing, as long as they stayed within earshot of the "throstle jobber," who would whistle when they were next needed.  They were motivated to do the work as fast as possible, since this gave them as long as possible to play. Between ten and twelve boys could handle a factory with about ten thousand [[Throstle frame|throstle]] spindles, depending on the amount of yarn being spun.{{sfn|Newbigging|1891|p=50}}
The doffers were usually the sons of poor people, and were small and skinny. They were sometimes called "The Devil's Own" for the tricks that they would get up to.{{sfn|Newbigging|1891|p=51}} As a rule they would go barefoot except at the coldest times of year.{{sfn|Newbigging|1891|p=52}}

At [[Quarry Bank Mill]] in [[Styal]], England, near Manchester, a doffer earned 1s/6d a day in 1790, and by 1831 was earning from 2s. to 3s. a day. An overlooker's wage in the same period rose from 15s. to 17s.{{sfn|Collier|1965|p=41-42}} In [[Leeds]] in the 1830s a doffer could earn 4s. to 5s.{{sfn|Morris|1990|p=102}} In the textile industry in Britain, wages for children continued to rise steadily compared to those for adults during the period from 1830 to 1860, indicating that demand was outstripping supply.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=58-59}} In Belfast linen factories in 1890 girls were employed as doffers, earning the equivalent of US $1.43 daily (about 6s. at the time.){{efn|In the 1890s the exchange rate varied very little from the "par" rate of $4.8665 to £1.  There were twenty shillings to the pound.  So $1.43 &amp;#61; (1.43/4.8665)*20s. &amp;#61; 5.88 s.  The doffer's daily wage would be worth perhaps $35 or £22 in 2011, although people now buy a very different mix of goods and services, e.g. phone calls but not coal.{{sfn|Nye|2011}}}}{{sfn|US Bureau of Foreign Commerce|1891|p=117}}

===North America===
[[File:Lucy Larcom with signature.jpg|thumb|[[Lucy Larcom]], author of ''A New England Girlhood'', became a bobbin doffer in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] in 1835, aged 11]]

In the United States in the first part of the 19th century, although the day was long the doffers only worked for about four hours each day.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=474}} Memoirs from writers such as [[Lucy Larcom]] and [[Harriet Hanson Robinson]] describe the long hours, but also the leisurely pace of work and the opportunities for social interactions.{{sfn|Zonderman|1992|p=27}} In Massachusetts in 1830 a doffer boy earned 25 cents a day. An overseer of rooms would make $1.25 a day, and the superintendent of a mill earned $2.00 a day, considered an excellent wage at the time.{{sfn|Earl|1877|p=28}} In the southern cotton mills it was customary to employ only whites for most jobs in the mill, although blacks had outside jobs and some inside jobs such as firing the boilers. This persisted well into the 20th century.{{sfn|Rhyne|1930|p=47-48}}

During the later part of the 19th century, working conditions in the U.S. textile industry deteriorated. Immigrant textile workers coming from Yorkshire and Lancashire to [[New England]] found the mills poorly run, with the managers cheating on measurements of cuts of cloth and time worked, and arbitrarily cutting wages without warning. These workers were often skilled, accustomed to being well-treated in their home country, and accustomed to taking industrial action if they were not.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|pp=190–191}} There were a series of strikes from the 1870s onward.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|p=398}}

An 1889 Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Relations of Capital and Labor in Canada recorded a statement by the assistant superintendent of St. Croix Cotton Mills in [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick]]. He said the mill employed some young boys around fifteen years old as doffers, but the average doffer was aged thirty. Wages were from 65 to 80 cents a day. In the summer hours were from 6:30 am to 6 pm, with a half day on Saturday. Winter hours were slightly longer.{{sfn|Armstrong|Freed|1889|p=481}}
An employee who had worked in both countries reported that wages were better than in the United States and working conditions better, although the hours were about the same.{{sfn|Armstrong|Freed|1889|p=486}}

Doffers in 1887 in a large mill in [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina]], both boys and girls, earned 40 cents a day.{{sfn|Vivian|1891|p=394}} In New England in the 1890s, the doffers, piecers and back boys had their own union, and were not admitted to the [[Spinning mule|mule spinners]]' union, even though they often aspired to become mule spinners.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|p=372}} Many left the industry rather than tolerate the conditions.{{sfn|Blewett|2000|p=389}} [[William Madison Wood]], the manager at the Washington Mill in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] instituted a system in 1895 where employees gained bonuses for meeting production quotas, as long as they missed no more than one day per month. The effect was that weavers drove spinners to produce, spinners drove doffers and so on, and that workers came in even when sick or injured. Wood then used the increased pay to justify running the looms at ever faster speeds.{{sfn|Watson|2006|p=23}}

===Rags to riches===
A doffer could achieve success if he had enough energy and ability. Stephen Davol, born in November 1807, joined his elder brothers as a doffer in the Troy mill in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] in 1818. After rising through the ranks, in 1833 he became superintendent of the Pocasset Mill at the age of twenty-six. He drew up the plans for building a giant new mill for the Pocasset company, {{convert|219|ft}} by {{convert|75|ft}} and rising to five stories. The mill was unusual for its time in being built as a whole to plans that considered both the structure and the arrangement of the machinery, belts and gearing.
From 1842 to 1860 Davol was agent, or chief executive, of the Troy Mill. By the 1870s he was a member of the board of ten different companies.{{sfn|Earl|1877|p=56-57}}

George Alexander Gray (1851–1912) is another example. Gray started work as a doffer before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when aged eight, earning ten cents a day in a mill at Pinhook, North Carolina. He had little education, but rose to the position of overseer in the mill, and then was given the job of supervising installation of machinery in new plants. He moved to [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], where he built the first mill with his own capital. By the time he died, there were eleven mills in Gastonia, of which Gray had been involved in establishing nine.{{sfn|Mitchell|1921|p=109}} Carl Augustus Rudisill (1884–1979) began work as a doffer boy in [[Cherryville, North Carolina]], at ten cents a day. He was superintendent of the Indian Creek Manufacturing Company by 1907, and later developed the Carlton Yarn Mills into a major operation.  He was a member of the North Carolina legislature from 1937 to 1941.{{sfn|Wehunt-Black|2008|p=105}}

==Early 20th century==

===Netherlands===
Towards the end of the 19th century, doffers in the Netherlands were mostly boys of about 12 years of age, who in 1890 had to go to school for a few hours each day. They were part of a team headed by a "minder", who was responsible for running two mules, and including a "big piecer" and a "little piecer", whose main job was to rejoin broken threads.{{sfn|Groot|1995|p=57}}
Around 1916, self-acting mules were introduced from Germany, which were simpler to operate. The team was reduced to one spinner and one piecer, with the position of doffer eliminated. The pace of modernization and mechanization was faster than in Lancashire, where the unions were more powerful.{{sfn|Groot|1995|p=59}}

===India===
A report on conditions in the [[Bombay]] mills in [[India]] between 1891 and 1917 noted that laws had been passed in response to agitation in England by which no child under nine years old could be employed.
In theory, children under fourteen could not work more than seven hours per day, broken into two work periods with a long rest period in between. In practice, much younger children were working longer hours at jobs such as doffing.{{sfn|Punekar|Varickayil|1990|p=76}} A man working in the mills would be paid Rs.7 to Rs.9 for the least skilled jobs to as much as Rs18 to Rs22 on a piece-work basis for a mule's minder or spinner. Doffer boys working full-time would earn Rs.4 to Rs.6.{{sfn|Punekar|Varickayil|1990|p=258}}  As of 1912 about 4,000 boys and girls were employed in the Indian mills, each doffing about 350 ring spindles.{{sfn|Punekar|Varickayil|1990|p=16-17}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
By 1900 in Crown Mills, [[Whitfield County, Georgia]], the average doffer was fourteen years old.{{sfn|Flamming|1995|p=99}}
A doffer in North Carolina in 1904 would earn $2.40 per week, while a head doffer would earn $3.50. Skilled workers would earn more.  A drawing-in girl could make $6.00, a warper $7.50 and an engineer up to $9.00, while the weave boss made as much as $15.00.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=79}} The working week would be ten hours a day from Monday to Saturday.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=78}} In 1907, a doffer in North Carolina only had to work about half the time, being able to play baseball, swim in the local river or otherwise relax until the whistle of the head doffer called them back to the mill.  If a rural mill depended on a water wheel for power, a drought could provide more free time as the mill would only run a few hours each day.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=88}}

[[File:OUR BABY DOFFER.jpg|thumb|"OUR BABY DOFFER" and some of the other infants all working in Avondale Mills. Location: Birmingham, Alabama. November 1910, by Lewis Hine]]
[[Lewis Hine]] obtained a job with the [[National Child Labor Committee]] in the United States in 1908, and over the next decade took many photographs that documented children at work.{{sfn|Freedman|1998|p=19}} Many of the children worked barefoot, which made it easier to climb the machinery to reach bobbins or broken threads. Children met with accidents more often than adults.
Hines was told by the overseer of one mill "We don't have any accidents in this mill .... Once in a while a finger is mashed, or a foot, but it don't amount to anything." Conditions were demanding.  There was a constant racket of machinery. The mill windows were kept closed, creating a hot and humid atmosphere in which cotton threads were less likely to break. The air was filled with lint and dust, making breathing difficult, and often leading to diseases such as tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis.{{sfn|Freedman|1998|p=35}} Some workers suffered from [[Byssinosis]], or brown lung, caused by prolonged exposure to cotton dust.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=81}}

At that time boys might start to work as doffers before the age of seven.{{sfn|Freedman|1998|p=35}} However, as Hines reported, "In every case, the youngsters told me their age as 12 years, even to the little Hop-o'-My-Thumb, whom the others dubbed 'our baby doffer.'  They would hesitate when I asked them, but always succeeded in remembering that they were twelve."{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=168}}
A photograph by Hine of an evidently very young doffer at the Melville Manufacturing Company in [[Cherryville, North Carolina]] appeared on the cover of a National Child Labor Committee report around 1912.{{sfn|Wehunt-Black|2009|p=20}} Hine's photographs of child workers such as doffers were influential in driving reform of child employment laws in the United States, an early example of the power of photo journalism.{{sfn|Naef|2004|p=84}} New laws were introduced, so that by 1914 very few children under 12 were working in the mills, and most were over 14.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=177-178}}

==Post World War I==
After [[World War I]] ended in 1918, the US textile industry was left with surplus capacity and went into a slump, not recovering until after the 1930s [[Great Depression]]. In response, mill owners cut wages and laid off workers, or put them on short hours, while mechanizing further to improve efficiency. New laws made child labor more expensive, and children could not handle the new machinery. The practice of using child labor in the mills declined, finally ending completely when the NIRA [[Cotton Textile Code]] was adopted in 1933.{{sfn|Hindman|2009|p=183-185}} Changes to the Factories Act in 1922 reduced formal child labor in the textile factories in India. By the 1940s there were negligible numbers of children in the [[Kanpur]] mills.
Most of the remaining child workers were doffer boys.{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=87}} Elsewhere the change was slower.  In Kenya in 1967 "doffer boy" was still listed as a job position in the [[Kisumu]] Cotton Mills, one of the lowest paid.{{sfn|Kenya Gazette 1967|p=1045}}

Improvements in working conditions were gradually introduced. In 1940 the British recognized byssinosis, or brown lung disease, and started to compensate victims. Due to lack of research and industry resistance, nothing was done about the disease in the United States until the 1970s.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=81}} Activists organized brown lung screening clinics in [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in 1975.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=358}} The Carolina Brown Lung Association had 7,000 members by 1981.
In 1984 the Occupational Health and Safety Administration responded to pressure from this group and implemented a new cotton dust standard.{{sfn|Hall|Korstad|2000|p=360}}

In modern mills the doffing process is relatively automated. with a mechanical doffer fitted to the winder that cuts and aspirates the yarn, removes the packages and places them in a yarn buggy, fits the empty tubes and transfers the yarn so winding can continue.{{sfn|Fourné|1999|p=596}}

==Poems and songs==
The song "The Doffing Mistress" is about flax spinning in Northern Ireland and describes the doffers respect for their mistress. The line "she hangs her coat on the highest pin" is because the doffer's work could lead to deformity of the spine.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Jon (1978) ''Victoria's Inferno''. Tettenhall: Broadside {{ISBN|0-9503722-3-4}}; p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Waugh]] is the author of the dialect poem "The Little Doffer" about a doffer in a Lancashire mill who obtained work despite his unsatisfactory replies to the overlooker (foreman).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Brian, ed. (1977) ''Songs of the People''. Manchester University Press {{ISBN|0-7190-0612-0}}; pp. 18, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Calgary''' is a region of central [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], it contains the second largest concentration of head offices in Canada.&lt;ref name=CanadaWest&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Full_Publication.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714171448/http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Full_Publication.pdf | archivedate=July 14, 2011 | title=State of the West 2010: Western Canadian Demographic and Economic Trends | publisher=[[Canada West Foundation]] | type=PDF | pages=65 &amp; 102 | year=2010 | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is divided into several neighbourhoods, the Central Business District, [[Eau Claire, Calgary|Eau Claire]], [[Chinatown, Calgary|Chinatown]], [[Downtown East Village, Calgary|East Village]], and the [[Downtown West End, Calgary|West End]]. There are a number of districts within Downtown Calgary as well, most of them being within the Central Business District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgarydowntown.com/dynamic.php?pageId=4 | title= Downtown Districts | author= Downtown Calgary Association| year=2005 | accessdate= 2017-02-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006202128/http://www.calgarydowntown.com/dynamic.php?pageId=4 |archivedate = October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, downtown Calgary is bordered by 14th Street W. on the west, the [[Bow River]] and [[Prince's Island Park]] on the north, the [[Elbow River]] on the east and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] mainline tracks on the south. The neighbourhoods of the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]] and [[Mission, Calgary|Mission]] to the immediate south are often considered part of downtown, due to the high concentrations of businesses, high population densities, and occurrence of retail and nightlife opportunities, but strictly speaking they are not technically part of downtown.

The population of Calgary's downtown has grown substantially in recent years, growing by several thousand between 2011 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://globalnews.ca/map/3229973/ | title= Population Change 2011 - 2016 | author=Global News and Statistics Canada| year=2017 | accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the population of the five combined downtown neighbourhoods surpassing 18 000 {{as of|2016|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.calgary.ca/CA/city-clerks/Documents/Election-and-information-services/Census2016/2016-Census-Results-Community-Tables.pdf | title= Comparative Community Results | author=City of Calgary| year=2016 | accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown Calgary now has a significantly larger population than that of other Canadian cities of similar size, such as [[Downtown Ottawa|Ottawa]] and [[Downtown Edmonton|Edmonton]].&lt;ref&gt;(Census tract number 5050048.00) http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&amp;T=1601&amp;SR=51&amp;S=94&amp;O=A&amp;RPP=25&amp;PR=0&amp;CMA=505&amp;CSD=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbhds&gt;{{cite web | url=https://data.edmonton.ca/City-Administration/Neighbourhoods-data-plus-kml-file-/65fr-66s6 | title=Neighbourhoods | publisher=City of Edmonton | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While downtown Calgary continues to grow, the Beltline neighbourhood to the immediate south, with a population of 21,958 {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, is taking up the majority of residential development in inner city Calgary.&lt;ref name=DevelopmentMap&gt;{{cite web| url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/maps/?cityID=3&amp;z=13&amp;status=1 | author=SkyscraperPage | title=Development Map Calgary | year=2017 | accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calgary Transit]]'s [[C-Train]] [[light rail]] system runs down 7th Avenue S. through the middle of downtown in a E-W direction, and the ride is free on this section. While the newly proposed Green Line of the C-Train will run underground through downtown under 2nd Street, running in a N-S direction.

==Neighbourhoods==
===Commercial core===
Calgary's dense business area comprises the bulk of the downtown community. It is a core of skyscrapers. {{as of|2017|February}}, eight of the [[List of Calgary's 10 tallest skyscrapers|ten tallest buildings]] in western [[Canada]], and a few of the tallest in the country, are in Calgary. It is arguably the densest downtown area of any city of its size in North America. Many of the buildings are connected via an {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long network of elevated walkways and bridges.

'''Economic torts''', which are also called '''business torts''', are [[tort]]s that provide the [[common law]] rules on liability which arise out of business transactions such as interference with economic or business relationships and are likely to involve [[pure economic loss]].

==Nature of economic torts==
Economic torts are [[tortious interference]] actions designed to protect trade or business. The area includes the doctrine of [[restraint of trade]] and, particularly in the United Kingdom, has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective [[labour law]] and modern [[competition law]], and certain laws governing [[intellectual property]], particularly [[unfair competition]] law. The "absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Deakin|first1= Simon|last2= Markesinis|first2= Basil|last3= Johnston|first3= Angus|year= 2003|title= Markesinis and Deakin's Tort Law|edition= 5th|location= |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 0-19925712-4|page= 509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal torts are:

:* [[passing off]],
:* [[injurious falsehood]] and [[trade libel]] (see also [[Food libel laws]]),
:* [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]],
:* inducement of [[breach of contract]],
:* [[tortious interference]] (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade),
:* negligent [[misrepresentation]], and
:* watching and besetting.

These torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers).

Two cases demonstrate economic torts' affinity to competition and labour law. In ''Mogul Steamship Co Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow &amp; Co]]'' (1889) LR 23 QBD 598&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this [[cartel]] was ruled lawful and "nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade."&lt;ref&gt;per [[Bowen LJ]], (1889) LR 23 QBD 598, 614&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel.

In English [[labour law]] the most notable case is ''Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants|link=Taff Vale Railway v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants|court=UKHL|year=1901|num=1|parallelcite=[1901] AC 426|date=22 July 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Lords]] thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the [[British Labour Party]] and the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]]. Further torts used against unions include conspiracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Quinn v Leathem|link=Quinn v Leatham|court=UKHL|year=1901|num=2|parallelcite=[1901] AC 495|date=5 August 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; interference with a commercial contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Torquay Hotel Co Ltd v Cousins|link=Torquay Hotels Ltd v Cousins|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1968|num=2|parallelcite= [1969] 1 All ER 522 |date=17 December 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; or intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Rookes v Barnard (No 1)|link=Rookes v Barnard|court=UKHL|year=1964|num=1|parallelcite=[1964] AC 1129|date=21 January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments==
Several of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and "tortious interference" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords:

:* In ''[[OBG Ltd v Allan]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Douglas &amp; Ors v. Hello! Ltd &amp; Ors|link=OBG Ltd v Allan|court=UKHL|year=2007|num=21|parallelcite=[2008] 1 AC 1|date=2 May 2007}}, [2007] UKHL 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority adopted a restrictive view of the unlawful means tort, where the plaintiff has a claim only where the wrong to the third party would have been actionable at the instance of that third party, and he must have an economic interest at stake in the interference by the defendant with that third party. 
:* In ''Total Network SL v Revenue and Customs'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Total Network SL v Revenue and Customs|link=|court=UKHL|year=2008|num=19|parallelcite=[2008] 1 AC 1174|date=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords distinguished the conspiracy tort from the unlawful means tort and held that a more flexible definition of “unlawful means” was needed in the conspiracy context.

In 2014, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], favouring the ruling in ''OBG'', standardized Canadian jurisprudence with respect to the "tort of unlawful interference with economic relations" (which it preferred to call "causing loss by unlawful means", or the "unlawful means tort"). In its ruling in ''[[A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.|link=A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.|year=2014|court=scc|num=12|parallelcite=|date=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; it declared:

#Liability to the plaintiff is based on (or parasitic upon) the defendant’s unlawful act against the third party.  The two core components of the unlawful means tort are that the defendant must use unlawful means and that the defendant must intend to harm the plaintiff through the use of the unlawful means.
#In order for conduct to constitute “unlawful means” for this tort, the conduct must give rise to a civil cause of action by the third party or would do so if the third party had suffered loss as a result of that conduct.  The unlawful means tort should be kept within narrow bounds, and it is not subject to principled exceptions.
#The defendant must have the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff as an end in itself or the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff because it is a necessary means of achieving an end that serves some ulterior motive.
#The focus of this tort is unlawful conduct that intentionally harms the plaintiff’s economic interests.  There need be no contract or even other formal dealings between the plaintiff and the third party so long as the defendant’s conduct is unlawful and it intentionally harms the plaintiff’s economic interests.
#The tort of unlawful means is available even if there is another cause of action available to the plaintiff against the defendant in relation to the alleged misconduct.

In 1979, Trompenaars received his MA in Economics at the [[VU University Amsterdam|Vrije Universiteit]] and in 1983 his PhD from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] for the thesis ''The Organization of Meaning and the Meaning of Organization''.

In 1981 Trompenaars started his career at the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] Personnel Division, working on job classification and management development.

=== Trompenaars' model of national culture differences ===
[[File:7 Dimensions of culture.svg|thumbnail|7 Dimensions of Culture]]
{{main|Trompenaars' model of national culture differences}}
Trompenaars' model of national culture differences is a framework for [[cross-cultural communication]] applied to general business and management, developed by Trompenaars and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Trompenaars, F., Hampden-Turner, C. (1997) ''Riding the Waves of Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "riding"/&gt; This model of national culture differences has seven dimensions.
# Universalism vs. particularism (''What is more important, rules or relationships?'') 
# Individualism vs. collectivism (communitarianism) (''Do we function in a group or as individuals?'')
# Neutral vs. emotional (''Do we display our emotions?'') 
# Specific vs. diffuse (''How separate we keep our private and working lives'')
# Achievement vs. ascription (''Do we have to prove ourselves to receive status or is it given to us?'')
# Sequential vs. synchronic (''Do we do things one at a time or several things at once?'') 
# Internal vs. external control (''Do we control our environment or are we controlled by it?'') 
There are five orientations covering the ways in which human beings deal with each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5938">'''Global R&amp;D management''' is the discipline of designing and leading [[R&amp;D]] processes globally, i.e. across borders, in multi-cultural and multi-lingual settings, and cutting across multiple time zones. In addition, managing R&amp;D organizations, and ensuring smooth transfer of new know-how and technology to other groups or departments involved in [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, V. (2001). R&amp;D Strategy and Organisation, Imperial College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boutellier, Roman |author2=Gassmann, Oliver |author3=von Zedtwitz, Maximilian |title=Managing Global Innovation |publisher=Springer |year=2000 |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-66832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Global R&amp;D teams trade the benefits of collocation and centralization with the benefits of local responsiveness, local insight and global synergy.

Global R&amp;D management today benefits the automotive, aerospace, medical, software and video game industries, among many others.&lt;ref name="ref7"/&gt; In order for companies to achieve their objectives
of a timely and cost-effective product development it often requires seeking resources outside the company confines. This can range from outsourcing non-core activities to co-development and collaboration.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/global-innovation.html|title=Global innovation|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Amritt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Industrial R&amp;D has globalized since the 1950s, when e.g. the US company [[IBM]] started a research center in Europe, but it was not before the 1990s that global R&amp;D reached noteworthy proportions in any firm. Access to local technology, access to local markets,&lt;ref&gt;von Zedtwitz, M.; Gassmann, O. (2002): Market versus Technology Drive in R&amp;D Internationalization: Four different patterns of managing research and development. Research Policy, 31, 4, 569–588.&lt;/ref&gt; and merger and acquisitions of parent companies led to a dispersion of R&amp;D activities worldwide. Various estimates now put the average internationalization of R&amp;D at 10% (for e.g. Japanese firms) to more than 50% (e.g. for many European and some US firms). Great variances among companies even within the same industry exist, indicating that there is no single normative strategy to determine the dispersion or globalization of R&amp;D.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Franklin R.

==Training==
Global R&amp;D Management requires that engineers, scientists and managers be trained for competence in cross-cultural communication, a skill not often taught in engineering schools.
Practical Books on the topic include as Cross-Cultural Dialogues: 74 Brief Encounters with Cultural Difference” by Craig Storti.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Craig Storti]] | year=1996 | title=Cross-cultural dialogues: 74 brief encounters with cultural difference  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rY1xBO4R8HcC&amp;dq=Cross-Cultural+Dialogues:+74+Brief+Encounters+with+Cultural+Difference | publisher=[[Intercultural Press]] | pages=140 | isbn=978-1-877864-28-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical workshops on communication with India are offered by Amritt, Inc &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/india-business-training-workshop.html|title=India business training workshop|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Amritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on China by Ionis International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionisinternational.com/faq/chinafaq.html|title=China Q&amp;A|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Ionis International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global R&amp;D management is concerned with the following sub-topics:
* virtual R&amp;D management
* open innovation
* set-up and establishment of R&amp;D centers
* R&amp;D location decisions
* cross-border R&amp;D project management
* technology transfer
* managing R&amp;D networks
* post-merger integration of R&amp;D units
* dissolution of R&amp;D centers
* productivity and performance measurement of R&amp;D

==Research centers==

Locations considered to be excellent places to find these resources are India and China because they are also the locales where many new products are targeted.&lt;ref name="ref7"/&gt; Companies such as General Electric have put up vast in-house research and development centers in emerging countries such as India. Establishing and running an offshore facility for [[R&amp;D]] take a serious commitment of management bandwidth.  Hundreds of American and European companies have found that this approach gives the best combination of security and long-term financial advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/offshore-research-and-development.html|title=Offshore research and development|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Amritt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''György Gordon Bajnai''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɡordon ˈbɒjnɒi|pron}}; born 5 March 1968) is a Hungarian entrepreneur and economist, who served as the [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] from 2009 to 2010. Prior to that, he functioned as Minister of Local Government and Regional Development from 2007 to 2008, then as Minister of National Development and Economy from 2008 to 2009. In March 2009, following Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s announced resignation, Bajnai was nominated by the ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP) to become Hungary's next head of government.&lt;ref name="Edith Balazs and Charles Forelle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123840402537769209|title=Hungary's Ruling Party Picks Premier|author=Edith Balazs and Charles Forelle|date=31 March 2009|work=WSJ|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bajnai became prime minister when the parliament passed a constructive motion of no-confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány on 14 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7972214.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Hungary parties back Bajnai as PM|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the office until the formation of the [[Second Orbán Government]] following the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]].

Returning to politics, Bajnai established [[Together (Hungary)|Together 2014]], a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations, in October 2012. The movement would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties to contrast Orbán's [[Fidesz]] in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]] with Bajnai as its prime minister-candidate, but negotiations have failed with the other opposition parties. Thereafter, the Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, and Bajnai had gradually marginalized in the upcoming months. He retired from politics after the 2014 national and European Parliament elections.

== Studies and student politics ==
Bajnai was born in [[Szeged]] and raised in [[Baja, Hungary]], the son of György László Bajnai and Ágota Sóvári.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pesterlloyd.net/html/1326federvieh.html Politisiertes Federvieh – Hat Ungarn nur die Wahl zwischen “linker” und “rechter” Mafia?] Pester Lloyd / 26 - 2013, Politik 26.06.2013&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his secondary studies at the local [[Béla III High School]] in 1986. He graduated from the [[Budapest University of Economic Sciences]] (now Corvinus University) International Relations Department in 1991. For his public and professional activities he was rewarded Pro Universitate Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-15|url=http://www.demokrata.hu/ujsagcikk/a_csodbiztos_a_bajnai_gordon_sztori___resz/|title=A csődbiztos - A Bajnai Gordon-sztori 1. rész|date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bajnai was very active in student-politics. In 1987, he organized a boycott of the University of Economics' canteen, and was the first chairman of the Independent Student Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nol.hu/archivum/archiv-469903 Antipolitikus politikus - Bajnai Gordon politikai portréja - A Political Capital elemzése], nol.hu&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the head of the History Department of Studium Generale, Admission Preparatory Studies College. In 1989, he, alongside [[András Schiffer]], participated in the establishment of the short-lived New Generation Movement (ÚNM), founded and led by [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/bajn060623/|title=Index - Gazdaság - Bajnai Gordon: A politika a legösszetettebb hivatás|author=Dudás Gergely|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurial career ==
After earning his [[master's degree]], Bajnai took a job at Creditum Financial Consulting Ltd. In 1993, he undertook an internship at the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] in London. Later he also worked for Eurocorp International Finance Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Bajnai Gordon&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1995 and 2000, Bajnai was the managing director of CA IB Securities Co., and was the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (at the same time when [[András Simor]], later head of [[National Bank of Hungary]], was the head of the company). Bajnai was leading, among others the IPO's of [[Richter Gedeon Co.|Gedeon-Richter]], [[MOL Group|MOL]], [[OTP Bank|OTP]], [[Magyar Telekom]], as well as some of the major [[M&amp;A]] transactions of this period.&lt;ref name=Business&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2005, he was CEO of Wallis Rt., an investment company. His duty was to restructure  the holding-company, make it more efficient and to manage its investments. Wallis group member companies were at that time Graboplast Rt., Rába Rt., Elender Rt., Index.hu, WING, Wallis Auto Holding, Danubius Radio, Café Advertistment. In 2003, the National Association of Managers awarded Bajnai as the "Young Manager of the Year".&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

Among the more than 100 Wallis-owned companies a poultry processing firm, Hajdú-Bét went bankrupt during 2003, against all efforts by its management and owners.&lt;ref name=Business/&gt; Many partners of Hajdú-Bét suffered serious losses during the time when the poultry market collapsed in 2003, Wallis group itself lost 10 billion forints (over 40 million Euros).&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

Years later, when he started his political career, Bajnai was criticized for the Hajdú-Bét collapse, although won all the lawsuits against media-outlets for false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/politika/belfold/baj627p/|title=Index - Belföld - Bajnai Gordon visszaszól|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20060703penzukert.html|title=A képviselők irodaházánál tüntettek a Hajdú-Bét károsultjai|author=ORIGO|work=origo.hu/|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he was Chairman of [[Budapest Airport]] (on behalf of [[BAA PLC|BAA]]), and member of the Supervisory Committee at [[Zwack]] Inc. He was a member of the Corvinus University of Budapest Economic Council. He resigned all of his company posts and board-memberships, when he entered the government as government commissioner, responsible for EU funds and national development.&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

== Political career ==

=== Member of the Gyurcsány II Cabinet ===
Bajnai first received a government post in 2006. On 1 July, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány's called on him to be the Government Commissioner for Development Policy. In this position, he was overseeing the National Development Agency, that controls EU Funds to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-15|url=http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/8k060707/|title=Bajnai Gordon szétoszt 8000 milliárd forintot|date=2006-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became minister in July 2007, in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. After [[SZDSZ]] left the coalition government, in May 2008, he took over the newly formed Ministry of National Development and Economy. During his period as Minister, Hungary has won the right to host the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]], and at the same time [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] has concluded a major FDI with the Hungarian Government in Kecskemét. From October 2008, Bajnai's activities had mainly focused on managing the evolving crisis in the real economy in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-15|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20090402-bajnai-gordon-tevekenysege-miniszteri-hivatali-ideje-alatt.html|title=Válság, adósság és az EU közt lavírozott Bajnai|date=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány resigned, announcing that he would hand over his position to a new premier with a higher support of the parties of the Hungarian Parliament.&lt;ref name="Hungary’s Premier Offers to Resign"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/world/22hungary.html?hp | work=The New York Times | title=Hungary's Premier Offers to Resign | first=Nicholas | last=Kulish | date=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungarian PM offers to step down"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/03/21/hungary.pm/index.html|title=Hungarian PM offers to step down|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) opposed most candidates for the post proposed by the Hungarian Socialists. Although Bajnai was reluctant to give in, after a week, with no tangible results in sight, and being asked by the majority of party stakeholders, who also assured him of their support of the needed austerity measures, he took the job. Securing the backing of both parties, Bajnai became prime minister on 14 April 2009.&lt;ref name="Edith Balazs and Charles Forelle"/&gt;

=== Prime Minister ===
{{Further|Cabinet of Gordon Bajnai}}
[[File:GeithnerBajnai 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Bajnai met with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]] on 4 December 2009]]
The Hungarian [[Hungarian National Assembly|Parliament]] elected Bajnai as Hungary's Prime Minister with 204 votes for, 8 abstentions. The remaining 174 MPs did not vote.

In his first speech as PM, he promised drastic measures to stop the negative spiral of the Hungarian economy, and to ease the burden of the international crisis. He also stated that he would remain in power until he had the solid majority of Parliament behind his austerity package, but will stay no longer than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ca031bec-b468-11de-bec8-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1|title=Hungary remains vulnerable to turmoil, says PM|work=Financial Times|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1157854921&amp;play=1|title=EU Pledged Support for Latvia: Hungary PM|website=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not want to nominate himself on [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|the next election]]; he undertook the task for only a year. [[Attila Mesterházy]] became the Hungarian Socialist Party's candidate for the position. The MSZP suffered its worst result since the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 elections]]. The sixth [[National Assembly of Hungary]] formed on 14 May 2010. In accordance with the [[Constitution of Hungary]] Bajnai became "acting Prime Minister" for the following days. In his last speech he raised word against the [[Jobbik]] fearing for democracy given the party's radical views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blikk.hu/blikk_aktualis/vona-gardemellenyben-tett-eskut-2018558|title=Vona gárdemellényben tett esküt|work=blikk.hu/|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new cabinet formed on 29 May 2010. Bajnai was succeeded by [[Viktor Orbán]]. After that he retired from politics and returned to business life.

====Economic policy====
[[File:Papandreou and Bajnai 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Greek PM [[George Papandreou]] with Bajnai in March 2010]]
Bajnai took over an economy that was expected to contract by 6 percent in 2009 and was kept afloat by a $25.1 billion IMF-led lifeline. Foreign investors were declining to finance Hungary's high budget and then current account deficits, and the forint's weakness threatened hundreds of thousands of families who took out foreign currency mortgages. Bajnai must have had to cut spending to rescue the budget, keep within IMF guidelines and regain investor confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/world/europe/20iht-hungary.html?_r=1|title=In Hungary, Potential Lessons for Greece|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cabinet of Gordon Bajnai|Bajnai government]] had four main goals:
* Immediate crisis management (Activities: Stabilization of the financial system, Safeguarding jobs, supporting those who lose their jobs, Programmes to help the financing of SMS’s; Accelerating absorption of EU funds)
* Stimulating economic growth (Activities: Reforming the tax system; Extra-budgetary regulations; Extra-Measures to increase activity)
* Balancing the economy (Activities: Measures for the sustainable operation of the public sector; Improving the sustainability of the pension system; Creating a more targeted social system)
* Restoring Global trust (Activities: Restoring public order and confidence; Restoring confidence; Solidarity:state, politics, wealthy people; Anti-corruption measures; Helping pensioners; Providing continuous information to the public on Government activities; Establishing a national crisis Fund to help the most needy)

Handling the ruling Socialists might have been  his most difficult task. He needed their votes but a sizeable section of the party viewed Bajnai with contempt because cuts in welfare spending was seen as eroding the party's traditional voter base. Despite this, Bajnai made a reform in taxes, pensions, public sector bonuses, maternity support, mortgage subsidies, energy subsidies and public transport subsidies.

Within six months, he managed to present a new budget that reduced government spending by five percent of [[GDP]]. Hungarian economic policy has regained its credibility, CDS-spread was less than one third of the level of a year before.

In an interview given to Handelsblatt, Bajnai said: “Most of the painful decisions were taken during the first 100 days of my government” (…)“It was clear what Hungary had to do, even if it was not easy politically. (…) This required painful adjustments from the people. Our challenge was keeping things bearable while simultaneously creating better conditions for stable and sustainable development. We have accomplished that goal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/europe/article2520313.ece/Pulling_Hungary_back_from_the_precipice|title=Pulling Hungary back from the precipice|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy====
His first visit abroad was in Brussels, where he debuted as Prime Minister. He had discussions with [[Jose Manuel Durao Barroso]], President of the European Commission, and with [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]], Secretary-General of [[NATO]].

[[File:I.brüssz.JPG|thumb|left|Gordon Bajnai with Barroso in Brussels.]]
In April he met with Austrian PM [[Werner Faymann]], in May, he attended the EU Partnership Summit in Prague. In May, he presented a speech on the Europe Forum, in Wachau, and in June, he attended the V4 summit in Kraków.  He made a two-day official visit to [[Israel]], where he met [[Shimon Peres]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and the Opposition Leader, [[Tzipi Livni]]. He also visited the [[Palestinian Authority]], where he met the Palestinian prime minister, [[Salam Fayyad]].

The Nabucco pipeline's intergovernmental agreement between [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], Hungary and Austria was signed by five Prime Ministers (including Bajnai) on 13 July 2009 in Ankara.&lt;ref name=bbc130709&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August, he met with [[Angela Merkel]], Chancellor of Germany, in Sopron. The event  was the 20th anniversary of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. In September he made a short official visit to Finland, where amongst others he met Prime Minister [[Matti Vanhanen]].
[[File:Wachajó.JPG|thumb|right|Gordon Bajnai presenting a speech in Wachau]]

On 10 September, he invited the Slovak PM [[Robert Fico]] to ease the tensions between Hungary and [[Slovakia]]. There were a clash of views between the two neighbors concerning the controversial amendment of the Slovak State Language Act. The two premiers expressed regret over the circumstances of a failed visit by President [[László Sólyom]] to [[Komárno]] on 21 August and agreed to accept all recommendations of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] high commissioner on national minorities. Prime Ministers Gordon Bajnai of Hungary and Robert Fico of Slovakia signed a joint statement during their meeting in [[Szécsény]].

Published on the [[Hungarian government]] spokesman's website, the statement declares the two countries' common interest in easing political tension. Bajnai and Fico agreed to direct the attention of all political parties to the social risks of confrontation, and called upon the citizens of both countries to show tolerance and understanding. They agreed to take resolute measures against extremist groups, and fight against all forms of [[xenophobia]], intolerance, [[chauvinism]], nationalism and violence, and the exportation thereof to one another's country. The two premiers declared that bilateral relations should be based on confidence, transparency and a pragmatic and constructive bilateral dialogue. They agreed to use all forms and instruments of cooperation, including further prime ministerial meetings.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Műegyetem rakpart október 23 148.JPG|thumb|right|Gordon Bajnai giving a speech in October 2013]]
Several months after retiring from public service, he founded the Patriotism and Progress Public Policy Foundation with some of his former government members and independent experts, which states on its website that its goal is "to shape the world view and attitudes of our citizens to build a better Hungary". "To realize this dream we will actively pursue a progressive agenda by learning from best practice and empowering communities to better themselves. We will amass and tutor the expertise and know-how to assist Hungary in facing the many tests it has to pass on the road to modernization."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Autumn of 2011 he became adjunct professor at [[School of International and Public Affairs|SIPA]] Columbia University in New York, and held lectures and speeches at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C., Princeton University, Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20110413/bajnais-office-confirms-former-pm-moving-to-new-york-for-two-months/|title=Bajnai’s office confirms former PM moving to New York for two months|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.rutgers.edu/events/2011/10/13/politics-eurozone-crisis|title=The Politics of the Eurozone Crisis|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bajnai announced his return to politics on 23 October 2012, during the anti-government demonstration of the One Million for Press Freedom (Milla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20121009/bajnai-said-to-announce-return-to-politics-on-october-23/|title=Bajnai said to announce return to politics on October 23|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the protest, he called for an anti-Orbán coalition so as to form a supermajority in Parliament with the help of which the changes done by Orbán's ruling party, Fidesz could be undone.

In his speech, Gordon Bajnai repeatedly used a variant of the term ("''We may fail on our own, but together, we shall prove victorious!''"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/ftp/speech_of_mr_gordon_bajnai_-_23_october_2012.pdf|title=Gordon Bajnai's speech as published on the home page of his organization|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131232/http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/ftp/speech_of_mr_gordon_bajnai_-_23_october_2012.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he proclaimed his support for such a "''cooperation between hopeful left-wingers, disappointed rightwingers, politically abandoned free-thinkers and  committed  Greens''" that his organization along with two other civilian body named [[Together 2014]] (later simply known as "Together") as a reference to the date of the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|next general election]] in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20052322|title=BBC News - Mass rallies mark 1956 Hungary uprising|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Bajnai announced his intention to be a parliamentarian candidate in the 2014 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20121217/bajnai-says-plans-to-run-for-parliament-in-car-accident-in-budapest/|title=Bajnai says plans to run for Parliament; in car accident in Budapest|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2014, five opposition parties entered into an electoral coalition and formed [[Unity (Hungary)|Unity]] alliance. In order to facilitate the creation of this alliance, Bajnai voluntarily gave up his candidacy of Prime Ministership, in favor of [[Attila Mesterházy]], the candidate of [[MSZP]], the largest party of this coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-01-14|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140114/quotable-antal-rogan-on-the-opposition-coalition/|title=Quotable: Antal Rogan on the opposition coalition|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unity, under the leadership of [[Attila Mesterházy|Mesterházy]] suffered a heavy defeat in the April election, nevertheless Bajnai was elected to the National Assembly from the second place of the alliance's joint list. Bajnai resigned from his parliamentary seat on 26 May 2014, and gradually withdrawn himself from domestic politics.

From September 2014, Gordon Bajnai returned to his original profession when he was named Group Chief Operating Officer of the [[Paris]]-based [[Meridiam]] infrastructure, a leading global investment fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-09-15|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140902-multicegnel-helyezkedik-el-bajnai-gordon.html|title=Multicégnél helyezkedik el Bajnai Gordon|date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators on both the left and right political wing agreed that Bajnai was quitting politics with that step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-09-15|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140915-veget-ert-bajnai-gordon-politikai-palyaja.html|title=Véget ért Bajnai Gordon politikai pályája|date=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}A hotel manager is a person who manages the operation of a [[hotel]], [[motel]], [[resort]], or other [[lodging]]-related establishment. Management of a [[hotel]] operation includes, but is not limited to [[Performance management|management of hotel staff]], [[management|business management]], upkeep and sanitary standards of hotel facilities, [[Customer satisfaction|guest satisfaction]] and [[customer service]], [[marketing management]], [[sales management]], [[revenue management]], [[financial accounting]], [[purchasing]], and other functions. The title "hotel manager" or "hotelier" often refers to the hotel's [[General Manager]] who serves as a hotel's head executive, though their duties and responsibilities vary depending on the hotel's size, purpose, and expectations from ownership. The hotel's General Manager is often supported by subordinate department managers that are responsible for individual departments and key functions of the hotel operation. 

==Hotel management structure==
The size and complexity of a hotel management organizational structure varies significantly depending on the size, features, and function of the hotel or resort. A small hotel operation normally may consist of a small core management team consisting of a Hotel Manager and a few key department supervisors who directly handle day-to-day operations. On the other hand, a large full-service hotel or resort complex often operates more similarly to a large [[corporation]] with an executive board headed by the [[General Manager]] and consisting of key directors serving as heads of individual hotel departments. Each department at the large hotel or resort complex may normally consist of subordinate line-level managers and supervisors who handle day-to-day operations.

===Example of Large/Full Service Hotel or Resort Complex===
A typical organizational chart for a large resort hotel operation may often resemble the following:

''General Manager reports to a Regional Vice President and/or Ownership/Investors''

**** Training Manager
**** Labor Relations Manager ''(For Unionized Hotels)''
*** Chief of Security
*** Recreation Manager
*** Information Technology Manager

''Additional Management Positions may exist for additional facilities such as hotel-owned golf courses, casinos, or spas.''

===Example for Small/Limited service hotel===
A typical organizational chart for a small low-rise hotel operation may resemble the following:

''Hotel Manager reports to Regional Director and/or Ownership/Investors''
* [[General Manager]]
** Guest Service Manager (Front of House)
** Housekeeping Manager
** Chief Engineer
** Sales &amp; Marketing Manager
** Food &amp; Beverage Manager

Administrative functions for a small-scale hotel such as Accounting, Payroll, and Human Resources may normally be handled by a centralized corporate office or solely by the Hotel Manager. Additional auxiliary functions such as security may be handled by third-party vendor services contracted by the hotel on an as-needed basis. Hotel management is necessary to implement standard operating procedures and actions as well as handling day-to-day operations.

==Typical qualifications==
The background and training required varies by the type of management position, size of operation, and duties involved. Industry experience has proven to be a basic qualification for nearly any management occupation within the lodging industry. A [[BS degree|BS]] degree in [[Hospitality management studies|Hospitality Management]] or an equivalent [[Business degree]] is often strongly preferred by most employers in the industry but not always required. 

A higher level graduate degree may be desired for a [[General Manager]] type position, but is often not required with sufficient management experience and industry tenure. A graduate degree may however be required for a higher level corporate executive position or above such as a Regional Vice President who oversees multiple hotel properties and General Managers.

==Working conditions==
Hotel managers are generally exposed to long shifts that include late hours, weekends, and holidays due to the [[24-hour]] operation of a hotel. The common workplace environment in hotels is fast-paced, with high levels of interaction with guests, employees, investors, and other managers.

Upper management consisting of senior managers, department heads, and [[General Manager]]s may sometimes enjoy a more desirable work schedule consisting of a more traditional [[business day]] with occasional weekends and holidays off.

Depending on the size of the hotel, a typical hotel manager's day may include assisting with operational duties, managing employee performance, handling dissatisfied guests, managing work schedules, purchasing supplies, interviewing potential job candidates, conducting physical walks and inspections of the hotel facilities and public areas, and additional duties.  These duties may vary each day depending on the needs of the property. The manager's responsibility also includes knowing about all current local events as well as the events being held on the hotel property.  Managers are often required to attend regular department meetings, management meetings, training seminars for professional development, and additional functions.  A hotel/casino property may require additional duties regarding special events being held on property for casino complimentary guests.

==Salary expectations==
The median annual wage in 2015 of the 48,400 lodging managers in the United States was $49,720. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/lodging-managers.htm |title=Lodging Managers : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2014-01-08 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Hugh Allan''', {{post-nominals|KCMG}} (September 29, 1810&amp;nbsp;– December 9, 1882) was a [[Scottish-Canadian]] [[shipping magnate]], financier and [[capitalist]]. By the time of his death, the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Shipping Line]] had become the largest privately owned shipping empire in the world. He was responsible for transporting millions of British immigrants to Canada, and the businesses that he established from [[Montreal]] filtered across every sphere of Canadian life, cementing his reputation as an [[Empire-building|empire builder]]. His home, [[Ravenscrag, Montreal|Ravenscrag]], was the principal residence of the [[Golden Square Mile]] in Montreal.

==Early years in Scotland==

Born at [[Saltcoats]], Ayrshire, he was the second son of Captain [[Alexander Allan (ship-owner)|Alexander Allan]] and his wife, Jean Crawford (1782–1856). He was a first cousin of [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt]], and his father was a first cousin of the Scottish bard, [[Robert Burns]]. In 1819, Allan's father established the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Shipping Line]], which became synonymous with running goods and passengers between Scotland and [[Montreal]]. Hugh Allan received a parish education at Saltcoats before starting work in 1823 at the family's [[counting house]] of Allan, Kerr &amp; Co., of [[Greenock]]. Three years later, he was sent by his father to Montreal to work as a clerk for the grain merchant, William Kerr. In 1830, he took a year off to travel through his native Scotland (he later named his home, Ravenscrag, after his favourite childhood haunt in [[Ayrshire]]) and continued via London, New York and [[Upper Canada]].

==Rise of the Allan Line at Montreal==
[[File:Edifice Allan.JPG|thumb|The offices of H &amp; A Allan by the Montreal harbor (built in 1863)]]
Returning to Montreal in 1831, Allan became a commission merchant with one of the city's leading importers, who had also acted as the Montreal agent for his family's company, J &amp; A Allan, back in Scotland. Concentrating on shipping, shipbuilding and purchasing grain, Allan advanced rapidly, aided by capital raised and contacts gained through family connections, as well as social bonds he developed himself in the predominantly Scottish business community at Montreal. By 1835, Allan was made a partner in the firm that from then was known as Millar, Edmonstone &amp; Co. With his father's encouragement and capital, Allan expanded the company's shipping operations, and J &amp; A Allan (then headed by his elder brother, James, in [[Glasgow]]) became closely involved with building of the [[merchant fleet]]. By the time (1839) Hugh's younger brother, [[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew]], had joined now Edmonstone, Allan &amp; Co., it had the largest shipping capacity of any Montreal-based firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/articles/sir_hugh_allan.asp|title=clydesite.co.uk|website=www.clydesite.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1850s, Edmonstone &amp; Allan was described by a credit-rating service as an "old, safe and respectable House... one of the wealthiest concerns in [[Province of Canada|the Province]]",{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} known for its responsible management and its links to trading houses in London, [[Liverpool]], and [[Glasgow]]. Helped by Allan's spreading influence into allied shipping, railway and banking concerns, the firm was "as good as a bank". From 1863, the company became known as H &amp; A Allan, of Montreal&amp;nbsp;— one segment, but an important and intricate part of the [[Allan Line|Allan family's empire]].&lt;ref name=DCB&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Brian J. |last=Young |others=in collaboration with Gerald J.J. Tulchinsky |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/allan_hugh_11E.html |title=Allan, Sir Hugh |volume=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Allan Royal Mail Line==
[[File:SS Canadian of the Allan Line, 1855.jpg|thumb|The ''Canadian'', 1855; along with the ''Indian'', these superior ships helped Allan to secure the Royal Mail contract in 1856]]
In 1851, Hugh Allan had been elected President of the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. As an entrepreneur and the chosen head of Montreal's business community, he used this position to advocate for the establishment of a regular government-subsidised steamship line between Britain, Montreal and [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]. The service, Allan declared, would deliver [[Royal Mail]] to both sides of the Atlantic Ocean while transporting immigrants to North America. Though it was Allan's idea, competition for the contract was fierce. Despite significant support on both sides of the Atlantic and careful preparation, Allan lost the bid in 1853. However, the consortium that won the contract, headed by [[Samuel Cunard]], ran into trouble almost immediately and Allan reacted by building more ships on the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]], using superior technology (notably the ''Canadian'' and the ''Indian''). These ships formed the nucleus of Allan's '''Montreal Ocean Steamship Company''', incorporated by him and his brother, [[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew]], in 1856. It was carefully created to be Canadian, but it was inextricably linked (and financed) by the Allan family in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/articles/sir_hugh_allan.asp|title=clydesite.co.uk|website=www.clydesite.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, with the help of conservative politicians such as Sir [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|John Rose]], Sir [[George-Étienne Cartier]] and [[Lewis Thomas Drummond|Lewis Drummond]], the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company (popularly referred to as the [[Allan Line]]) wrested back the contract from [[Samuel Cunard]]. By 1859, service was weekly, and Allan reported his capital investment in the company at £3.5 million.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt;

Beyond mail and emigrating passengers, the Allan Line carried [[Royal family|royalty]] (converting one of its ships with no expense nor detail to attention spared), troops (in the [[Crimean War|Crimean]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu]] wars), general cargo, manufactured goods and much needed Canadian wheat to Britain. After the [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]] opened in 1859, Allan became dependent on the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] and signed a ten-year deal with them. But he soon became frustrated with the railway when he wanted them to triple their deliveries from the [[American Midwest]], and he felt threatened by the railway's plans to form a steamship line of its own with rival firms in New York and [[Boston]]. By 1873, Allan expressed "a desire to protect ourselves".&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt;

==Railways and the Pacific Scandal==

At the same time that Allan was falling out with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], the Canadian government had committed to building a railway across to [[British Columbia]]. Though slow to move into the railway business, by the 1870s Allan had become Canada's most flamboyant railway entrepreneur. He helped to place trusted colleagues (such as his lawyer [[John Abbott]], agent [[Louis Beaubien]] and the politician [[John Hamilton (Quebec politician)|John Hamilton]]) in senior positions with railways connected to the venture. Allan himself invested heavily, particularly in those that would link the Port of Montreal to the [[Canadian West]], and became president of the Montreal Northern Colonization Railway in 1871. Garnering the support of [[French Canada|French-Canada]] (helped in a large part by his relationship with [[Antoine Labelle]]), Allan’s railway gained major benefits in [[Quebec]], including a $1 million subscription from the [[City of Montreal]]. Allan was reckoned the most influential [[capitalist]] in 1870s Canada, and having staved off American interest in the Pacific Railway, he was the logical choice for winning the contract.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt;

He created a [[syndicate]] to build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|national railway]], promised as a condition of [[British Columbia]] joining [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. To ensure the contract, he bribed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[John A. Macdonald]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} subscribing over $350,000 for Macdonald's re-election campaign in 1872, but the [[Pacific Scandal]] (and Macdonald's defeat) ended his dreams of supremacy in the railway business. However, through his bank, the Merchant's Bank of Canada, he still financed and maintained a vested interest in many of the Canadian railway companies.

==Merchant's Bank of Canada==
[[File:Merchant's Bank Building on St. James Street, Montreal. 1870-75.jpg|thumb|Merchant's Bank Building on St. James Street, [[Montreal]], 1870]]
While still in his thirties, Allan became a director of the [[Bank of Montreal]] and remained on the board for ten years (1847–57). He also held significant shares in the Commercial Bank of Canada, the [[Bank of Upper Canada]], the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada and the City Bank of Montreal. He was a director of the Montreal Credit Company and president of the Provincial Permanent Building Society which became the Provincial Loan Company in 1875. Hugh Allan founded [[Merchant's Bank of Canada]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], in 1864 with a capital of $6.78 million and a reserve fund of $6.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To service his financial needs and as a source of capital, Allan established the Merchants’ Bank of Canada. Run as a family business, it was chartered in 1861 but did not open until 1864. Allan served as president of the bank until his death, when he was succeeded by his brother, Andrew. The bank soon became known as one of Canada's most aggressive. They took over the failing Commercial Bank of Canada, and by the mid-1870s had branches in New York and London.

Allan's association with the bank facilitated his growth in other profitable ventures. Allan had interests in new communications technology,&lt;ref name="McCallum"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McCallum |first=Margaret E. |title=Sir Hugh Allan |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |orig-year=January 16, 2008 |date=March 4, 2015 |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-hugh-allan}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufacturing,&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt; and mining.&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt; In 1852, he became president of the [[Montreal Telegraph Company]],&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt; ultimately selling MTC's "telephone plant" to [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] for $75,000.&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt;&lt;!--US$ or C$?--&gt; He also established coal mines in [[Nova Scotia]] and factories for textiles, shoes, paper, tobacco, and iron and steel in Central Canada.&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt;

==Ravenscrag==
[[File:Ravenscrag.jpg|thumb|[[Ravenscrag, Montreal|Ravenscrag]], Allan's home in Montreal's [[Golden Square Mile]], completed in 1863]]
[[File:Vivoir, résidence de Lady Allan (II-185092).jpg|thumb|The [[drawing room]] at Ravenscrag]]
In 1860, Allan bought part of the estate of [[Simon McTavish]] and demolished the old manor house that stood there to make way for his new home, [[Ravenscrag, Montreal|Ravenscrag]], a sumptuous [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style house and the principal residence of the [[Golden Square Mile]]. The house, which surpassed [[Dundurn Castle]] in scale and grandeur, was completed in three years in 1863, and the ballroom alone could comfortably accommodate several hundred guests.

After his death in 1882, it was lived in by his second son, [[H. Montagu Allan|Sir Montagu Allan]], until he donated it in 1940 to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal]]. The Allans entertained [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]], [[Lord Lisgar]], the [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Earl of Dufferin]], [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Viscount Wolseley]], and others.

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Lady Matilda Caroline Allan by William Notman.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Allan, by [[William Notman]]]]
At Montreal on August 13, 1844, Allan married Matilda Caroline Smith (1828–1881), the eldest of the four daughters of John Smith (d. 1872) of Athelstane Hall, Montreal, and his wife Betsy Rea. John Smith was a native of [[Athelstaneford]] in Scotland and became one of Montreal's leading dry goods merchants. Caroline's sister, Isabella, married Hugh's brother [[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew]] in 1848. Her two other sisters married respectively Hartland St. Clair MacDougall (brother of [[George Campbell MacDougall]]) and James St. George Bellhouse, of the firm Bellhouse &amp; Dillon. Lady Allan died in Montreal in June 1881, aged 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Morgan |editor-first=Henry James |editor-link=Henry James Morgan |title=Types of Canadian Women and of Women who are or have been Connected with Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Williams Briggs |date=1903 |url=https://archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft/page/8 |page=8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

They were the parents of four sons (a fifth predeceased his father) and eight daughters, including:
*Alexander Rea Allan (2 Aug 1845 – 29 Jun 1901), who "was not cut out for business". He married Eva Belford Travers, daughter of John N. Travers and a niece of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[James Travers]], [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]] The couple lived quietly with their son, (Hugh) Travers, at 112 King Street in [[Brockville, Ontario]], where he managed the [[Bank of Montreal]] office.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Morgan |editor-first=Henry James |editor-link=Henry James Morgan |title=Types of Canadian Women and of Women who are or have been Connected with Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Williams Briggs |date=1903 |url=https://archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft/page/7 |page=7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phoebe Mary Allan (1852–1904), married on March 1, 1877, Sir George Lauderdale [[Houstoun-Boswall Baronets|Houstoun-Boswall]], 3rd Bart., grandson of General [[Sir William Houston, 1st Baronet]]. Lady Houstoun-Boswall was the mother of one daughter and two sons.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;
* Matilda Isabella Allan (1854–1932), died unmarried.
* Florence Adelaide Allan (1857–1942), married Alfred H. White of [[Quebec City]], and following his death, Major General J.F. Wilson. The White daughters, Gladys and Eileen, both married sons of John Ogilvie, brother of [[William Watson Ogilvie]] and with him one of the founders of Ogilvie Mills. Gladys married Capt.(later Brig.) Alexander Thomas Ogilvie, and Eileen married realtor Douglas Watson Ogilvie. Dorothy White married a Montreal lawyer, John Wilson Cook.
* Margaret Macfie Allan (1858–1939), married veterinarian Dr. Charles McEachran (1864–1919) of Montreal.
*[[H. Montagu Allan|Sir Montagu Allan]] (1860–1951), vice-chairman of the Allan Line, President of the Merchants Bank. Principal heir of his father, he inherited [[Ravenscrag, Montreal|Ravenscrag]] and married, in 1893, Marguerite Ethel Mackenzie. Their four children, including [[Martha Allan]], predeceased them.
* Bryce James Allan (1862–1924), managed the Allan Line from [[Boston]]. He was educated at [[Bishop's College School]] and in France and Germany. He lived at "Allanbank" near Boston (now known as Tupper Manor and part of [[Endicott College]]). In 1896, he married Anna, daughter of General [[Francis Winthrop Palfrey]] of Boston.
* Edythe Maud Allan (1863–1946), married (James) Turner Routledge (d. 1899). They purchased one of Edith's father's farms, "Belmere" in Georgetown, Quebec, and were the parents of two sons, Lieut. Allan (d. 1916) and Maj. James Colin (d. 1977).
* Mabel Gertrude Allan (1867–1955), married Colin Augustus Monk Campbell (1860–1926), Seigneur de [[Rouville Regional County Municipality|Rouville]]. He was the son of Major [[Thomas Edmund Campbell]] and Henriette-Julie, daughter of Captain [[Michel-Louis Juchereau Duchesnay]]. They lived at Manoir Rouville-Campbell in St. Hilaire, Quebec. Two children survived infancy: Enid Margaret (Mrs. Joseph C. Wray), and Phoebe Duchesnay.
* Arthur Edward Allan (1871–1893), died young in an accidental fire.

==Final years==
In 1871, Allan was created a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] by [[Queen Victoria]] for his services in connection with the development of ocean steam navigation in Canada.&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt; Not long after the death of his wife, he died in [[Edinburgh]] while visiting his son-in-law, Sir George [[Houstoun-Boswall Baronets|Houstoun-Boswall]], in December 1882.

At his death, he was one of the richest men in the world, with a fortune estimated to be between eight and twelve million [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. His remains were brought back to Montreal, and he was buried with his family at the [[Mount Royal Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="McCallum"/&gt; The Allan family's Canadian enterprises, almost entirely built by Hugh, were continued by his brother, [[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew Allan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Farr |first=D.M.L. |title=Sir Hugh Andrew Allan |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |orig-year=January 16, 2008 |date=December 16, 2013 |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-hugh-andrew-allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Started out as the American Bottled Water Association, ABWA founded in 1958,It took on the mantel of IBWA as it grew to include international bottlers in the early 1980s.  

==Controversy and criticisms==
Since 2011, 23 of America's national parks had ended the sale of bottled water products in a bid to become environmentally sustainable.  After several months of [[lobbying]], the [[Trump administration]] in 2017, the IBWA succeeded in ending this cessation of sales and once again allowing [[plastic bottle]]d water waste to be produced inside all national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/20/trumps-decision-to-allow-plastic-bottle-sales-in-national-parks-slammed|title=Trump's decision to allow plastic bottle sales in national parks slammed|last=Glenza|first=Jessica|date=2017-08-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">'''Jan Baan''' (Born in [[Rijssen]], 9 March 1946) is a Dutch [[entrepreneur]] and [[venture capitalist]], known as the founder of the [[Baan Corporation|Baan Company]], a software company providing [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) software. After selling the company, he founded Cordys, a company to provide web-related ERP products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrahams |first=Peter |title=Jan Baan the software man |publisher=[[The Register]] |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/25/jan_baan_cordys/ |accessdate=12 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NKM2jlKQ?url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/25/jan_baan_cordys/ |archivedate=12 February 2014 |date=25 June 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Baan was born and raised in [[Rijssen]] as eldest son in a family of ten. His father was a [[carpenter]], and his grandfather on his mother's side was cofounder of a regional bus company.&lt;ref name="HM 2004"&gt;Henk Post "[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHub0hNZSEQC&amp;pg=PA229 De snelle groei van de Baan Company: de rol van Jan Baan] in: ''Ondernemen in netwerken.'' Wim Hulsink, Dick Manuel (eds.), 2004. p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, Baan started working at a [[Slaughterhouse|meatworks]], leaving secondary school without a degree. After serving in the military, Baan got a job at an accounting firm. In 1970, he started working for a wholesale firm, where after two years he became head of the accounting department. When the company bought their first computer, Baan got acquainted with automation. Mid 1970s Baan started working as a consultant, and shortly managed the financial department of a large company.&lt;ref name="HM 2004"/&gt;

In 1978, Jan founded The Baan Company, a software company providing ERP solutions, which became a major player in the ERP software industry. Jan Baan left the Baan Company in 1998. After his efforts with the Baan Company, Baan became a venture capitalist&lt;ref name="HM 2004"/&gt; and invested in companies like Top Tier and [[WebEx]];  both were eventually valued above $1billion. Top Tier was later sold to [[SAP AG|SAP]], while WebEx was sold to [[Cisco]]. In an interview, Baan said that "... with [[WebEx]] and Top Tier I was an investor. [[Baan Corporation|Baan]], and [[Cordys]], I do for life. I am not a serial entrepreneur at all." &lt;ref&gt;CBR Online's Q&amp;A: Jan Baan on the demise of Baan and the birth of Cordys Part 1, 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Baan wrote a book on his life as an entrepreneur, called The Way to Market Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;The Way To Market Leadership [https://www.amazon.com/Way-Market-Leadership-Life-Entrepreneur/dp/B00289ZRZO], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Baan Company ===
The Baan Company was founded in 1978. With the development of his first software package in 1979, he commenced his career in the ERP industry. His brother [[Paul Baan]] joined him in the management of the company. Under Jan's stewardship, the company made good market in the field of [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) software and grew from a $35 million company in the early 1990s to $680 million in 1998.

The Baan Company competed successfully with large companies like [[SAP AG|SAP]] and [[PeopleSoft]] and became the number 2 ERP player in the software industry.&lt;ref&gt;Cordys Executive Team: Jan Baan, Executive Chairman and CEO [http://www.cordys.com/ufc/file2/cordyscms_sites/download/dad8a85a9d49e6fa99ced341d1fe535d/pu/bio_jan_baan.pdf], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company's fall started in 1998 as the stocks started to dip and eventually in 2000 it was sold to the British company [[Invensys]].&lt;ref&gt;The Baan Company [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Baan-Company-Company-History.html], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cordys ===
In 2001, Baan started a new company, Cordys, along with Theodoor van Donge. The intention was to produce products serving to bridge the traditional [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] products with the internet, using the internet as the front end.&lt;ref&gt;Cordys Background [http://www.cordys.com/cordyscms_com/cordys_history_mission.php], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ERP pioneer Jan Baan on impact of BPM [http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid26_gci1378738,00.html], 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010 Cordys Switzerland AG was founded as an independent legal entity according to Swiss law. The Swiss company was not part of the later M&amp;A deal between Jan Baan and OpenText.

In August 2013, Jan Baan sold Cordys to [[OpenText]] for 33M USD.

'''Jørgen Vig Knudstorp''' (born 21 November 1968 in [[Fredericia]]) is the executive chairman and former CEO of the [[Lego Group]]. He succeeded [[Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen]] and is the first non-family member to head Lego.

==Early years==

Knudstorp was born in 1968, grew up in [[Fredericia]] and graduated from [[Fredericia Gymnasium]] before attending [[Aarhus University]].&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/en/annualcelebration/annual-celebration-2014/the-aarhus-university-distinguished-alumnus/?no_cache%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010200515/http://www.au.dk/en/annualcelebration/annual-celebration-2014/the-aarhus-university-distinguished-alumnus/?no_cache=1 |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his undergraduate degree, Knudstorp began an academic career as a researcher at his alma mater as well as obtaining a master's degree (1995) and a PhD (1998) in Economics from [[Aarhus University]].&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni" /&gt; He stayed in academia, but worked as a business consultant from 1998 to 2000.&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni" /&gt;

==Lego career==
Jørgen Vig Knudstorp joined the LEGO Group in 2001 after working as a [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] consultant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feloni|first1=Richard|title=How LEGO Came Back From The Brink Of Bankruptcy|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-lego-made-a-huge-turnaround-2014-2?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T|website=businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lionello Stock''' (1866–1948) was a [[Croatia]]n-[[Italy|Italian]] industrialist, businessman and owner of the Camis &amp; Stock company (now [[Fernet Stock]]).

==Family antecedents==
Born in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] on 16 December 1866 to Abramo and Gentile ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Valenzin), Stock was raised with his brother [[Emil Stock]] and 10 siblings. Stock's paternal [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Jews in Croatia|Jewish]] family originated from [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[German Empire]], while his maternal [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Jewish family arrived in Split during [[Napoleonic era]]. His father moved to Split in 1844 from [[Trieste]] (then in the [[Austrian Empire]]).

==Foundation and development of the Company==
In 1884 Stock and his partner Carlo Camis founded the steam wine distillery "Distilleria a vapore Camis &amp; Stock". His company's main product was cognac "Medicinal", which competed with French alternatives in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] and [[German Empire]] territory. By the 1920s the Stock company was one of the largest companies of its kind in Europe. In 1920, after [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] collapsed, Stock bought a distillery factory at [[Plzeň| Plzeň Božkov]] (in the then [[Czechoslovakia]]). Stock eventually came to own a network of distilleries, bottling plants and ageing facilities in [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]]. He also expanded business and established an outpost in [[New York City]], [[United States]].

==WWII Nazi persecution and aftermath==
In 1939, following the Nazi annexation, the Stock factory in Plzeň - being a Jewish business - was seized by [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation force. In later stages of World War II, Stock himself - already an old man - was [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral|persecuted]] along with other Jews in Trieste, but managed to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ortolani|first=Giovanni|coauthors=|title=Stock, l'addio a Trieste è definitivo.

Stock died at Trieste in 1948.

==Biography==
Robinson's childhood was traumatic, at the age of two, his parents separated. Robinson and his mother regularly moved from one place to another. He left formal education at the age of 16 to work as a cleaner and later on started a job in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3426789/Businessman-diet-mini-bars-boozy-lunches-led-heart-failure-swimwear-model.html |title=Unhealthy dad, 47, whose 'boozy lunches' led to a heart attack becomes a model after swapping his high-pressure job for the gym |last=Unity |first=Blott |date=2006-02-03 |website=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, after being fired and divorced, Robinson came up with the idea of creating a travel rewards business for employees at multinational corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/meet-man-gave-away-three-bedroom-house-free/ |title=Meet the man who gave away a three-bedroom house for free |last=Sanghani |first=Radhika |date=2017-08-08 |website=The Telegraph |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his initial success, he expanded into property investment and founded luxury brand the Naked Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/famous-entrepreneurs/marco-robinson-suffered-a-heart-attack-at-29-now-he-runs-multi-million-pound-businesses/12452.article |title=Marco Robinson suffered a heart attack at 29, now he runs multi-million-pound businesses |last=Dunsby |first=Sarah |date=11 July 2016 |website=londonlovesbusiness |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making it to the top of the Corporate World, by taking a Malaysian Public company from broke to 1 Billion Dollars in three years, he soon realized that the employee life was not for him. After some personal intervention, he hired a personal mentor and started to create his own Empire in a bid to be different and make a difference.

Marco built several Multi-Million Dollar companies from scratch such as the “Wealth Revolution Group”; “Create Demand Incentive Programs”; “The Rich List”; “NAKED Restaurants” and more.  He personally owns over 100 properties and became a Multi-Millionaire property Investor and World Authority Speaker on Investing and speaks worldwide to hundreds and thousands of people...

In 2017, Robinson decided to give away a flat in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and make a documentary on it. His documentary aired on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/29/millionaire-is-giving-away-a-120000-apartment-for-free-6413428/ |title=Millionaire is giving away a £120,000 flat for free |last=Mills |first=Jen |date=2017-01-29 |website=Metro |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
In [[law]], '''misappropriation''' is the unauthorized use of another's name, likeness, or identity without that person's permission, resulting in harm to that person.

Another use of the word refers to intentional and illegal use of property or funds; it can particularly refer to when done by a [[public official]].

==Criminal law==
In criminal law, misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the [[property]] or funds of another person for one's own use or other unauthorized purpose, particularly by a public official, a [[trustee]] of a [[Trust law|trust]], an executor or administrator of a deceased person's [[estate (law)|estate]] or by any person with a responsibility to care for and protect another's assets (a [[fiduciary]] duty). Depending upon the [[jurisdiction]] and value of the property, misappropriation may be a [[felony]], a crime punishable by a prison sentence.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Scientific research==
In [[scientific method|scientific]] [[research]], misappropriation is a type of research misconduct. An investigator, scholar or reviewer can obtain novel ideas during the process of the exchange of ideas amongst colleagues and peers. However, improper use of such information could constitute fraud. This can include [[plagiarism]] of work or to make use of any information in breach of any duty of [[confidentiality]] associated with the review of manuscripts or grant applications.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Consequences of misappropriation==
Misappropriation can have very serious consequences, including imprisonment, fines, [[probation]], and a permanent criminal record.

The punishment for misappropriation may be determined by the value of the property affected and previous criminal record.

==Defenses==
Since misappropriation is considered a form of theft, arguments countering charges of theft can be modified and utilized against misappropriation, including:

*Property did not belong to the plaintiff. Information which is available to everyone, such as facts in a news story, is considered public and thus cannot be owned by the plaintiff.
*Independent development of property. The defendant did not “take” the plaintiff’s trade secrets if the defendant created the trade secrets independent of the plaintiff’s knowledge, resources and involvement.
*Consent by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff had given the defendant permission to use the property for a purpose, then the defendant cannot be guilty of misuse if the defendant used the property for that purpose.

==Differences between misappropriation and embezzlement==
[[Embezzlement]] is misappropriation when the property or funds involved have been lawfully entrusted to the embezzler. In circumstances where the funds are accessible to, but not entrusted to, the perpetrator, it is not embezzlement but can still be considered [[larceny]], misappropriation, misapplication, or some other similar term.

==Examples of misappropriation==
For an example, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112193722/http://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/caci_2013_edition.pdf §1803] of the Judicial Council of California's Civil Jury Instructions from 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7564">'''Payback period''' in [[capital budgeting]] refers to the period of time required to recoup the funds expended in an investment, or to reach the [[Break-even (economics)|break-even point]]. &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project].&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a $1000 investment made at the start of year 1 which returned $500 at the end of year 1 and year 2 respectively  would have a two-year payback period. Payback period is usually expressed in years. Starting from investment year by calculating Net Cash Flow for each year: Net Cash Flow Year 1 = Cash Inflow Year 1 - Cash Outflow Year 1. Then Cumulative Cash Flow = (Net Cash Flow Year 1 + Net Cash Flow Year 2 + Net Cash Flow Year 3, etc.) Accumulate by year until Cumulative Cash Flow is a positive number: that year is the payback year.

The [[time value of money]] is not taken into account. Payback period intuitively measures how long something takes to "pay for itself." [[All else being equal]], shorter payback periods are preferable to longer payback periods. Payback period is popular due to its ease of use despite the recognized limitations described below.
   
The term is also widely used in other types of investment areas, often with respect to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies, maintenance, upgrades, or other changes. For example, a [[compact fluorescent]] light bulb may be described as having a payback period of a certain number of years or operating hours, assuming certain costs. Here, the return to the investment consists of reduced operating costs. Although primarily a financial term, the concept of a payback period is occasionally extended to other uses, such as [[Energy returned on energy invested#Relationship to net energy gain|energy payback period]]&lt;ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Payback period as a tool of analysis is often used because it is easy to apply and easy to understand for most individuals, regardless of academic training or field of endeavor. When used carefully or to compare similar investments, it can be quite useful. As a stand-alone tool to compare an investment to "doing nothing," payback period has no explicit criteria for decision-making (except, perhaps, that the payback period should be less than infinity).

The payback period is considered a method of analysis with serious limitations and qualifications for its use, because it does not account for the [[time value of money]], [[risk]], [[financing]], or other important considerations, such as the [[opportunity cost]]. Whilst the time value of money can be rectified by applying a weighted average cost of capital discount, it is generally agreed that this tool for investment decisions should not be used in isolation. Alternative measures of "return" preferred by economists are [[net present value]] and [[internal rate of return]]. An implicit assumption in the use of payback period is that returns to the investment continue after the payback period. Payback period does not specify any required comparison to other investments or even to not making an investment.

== Construction ==
Payback period is usually expressed in years. Start by calculating Net Cash Flow for each year: Net Cash Flow Year 1 = Cash Inflow Year 1 - Cash Outflow Year 1. Then Cumulative Cash Flow = (Net Cash Flow Year 1 + Net Cash Flow Year 2 + Net Cash Flow Year 3, etc.) Accumulate by year until Cumulative Cash Flow is a positive number: that year is the payback year.

To calculate a more exact payback period:
Payback Period = Amount to be Invested/Estimated Annual Net Cash Flow.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. R., et al., ''Financial and Managerial Accounting,'' McGraw-Hill, 2012, p. 1117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It can also be calculated using the formula:
               Payback Period = (p - n)÷p  + n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
                              = 1 + n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; - n÷p    (unit:years)
Where&lt;br /&gt;
n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;= The number of years after the initial investment at which the last negative value of cumulative cash flow occurs.&lt;br /&gt;
n= The value of cumulative cash flow at which the last negative value of cumulative cash flow occurs.&lt;br /&gt;
p= The value of cash flow at which the first positive value of cumulative cash flow occurs.&lt;br /&gt;
This formula can only be used to calculate the soonest payback period; that is, the first period after which the investment has paid for itself. If the cumulative cash flow drops to a negative value some time after it has reached a positive value, thereby changing the payback period, this formula can't be applied. This formula ignores values that arise after the payback period has been reached.

Additional complexity arises when the cash flow changes sign several times; i.e., it contains outflows in the midst or at the end of the project lifetime. The modified payback period algorithm may be applied then. First, the sum of all of the cash outflows is calculated. Then the cumulative positive cash flows are determined for each period. The modified payback is calculated as the moment in which the cumulative positive cash flow exceeds the total cash outflow.

== Shortcomings ==
Payback period doesn't take into consideration the time value of money and therefore may not present the true picture when it comes to evaluating cash flows of a project. This issue is addressed by using [[Discounted_payback_period|DPP]], which uses discounted cash flows. Payback also ignores the cash flows beyond the payback period. Most major capital expenditures have a long life span and continue to provide cash flows even after the payback period. Since the payback period focuses on short term profitability, a valuable project may be overlooked if the payback period is the only consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12528">'''Pieter de la Court''' (1618 &amp;ndash; May 28, 1685) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[economics|economist]] and businessman, he is the origin of the successful De la Court family. He pioneered modern thinking about the economic importance of free [[competition]] and was an uncompromising advocate of [[the republican form of government]].

==Biography==

Pieter de la Court was born in [[Leiden]], the son of Pieter de la Court the Elder and Jeanne des Planques. His parents were [[protestant]] immigrants from [[Flanders]], who settled in Leiden around 1613 in order to be able to practise their faith and to profit from the rapid expansion of Leiden as the world centre of cloth manufacturing. Pieter de la Court the Elder was a successful cloth merchant before he arrived in Leiden. His wife also came from a family of wealthy cloth manufacturers. They had established themselves as members of the local economic elite by the time Pieter was born. The couple had three other children; Jacob (born 1617), Johanna (born 1620) and Johan (1622–1660). Johan is generally seen as the author of at least two of the books that have later been ascribed to Pieter.

De la Court studied at [[Leiden University]] and completed his education with a [[Grand Tour]] through Europe in 1641 - 1643. He went to [[London]], [[Saumur]] (France), [[Geneva]] and [[Basle]]. The diary he kept during his journey has been preserved and was published in 1928. After returning to Leiden, De la Court entered his father's profession and set up a cloth trading firm with his brother Johan. By 1650 the firm of the two brothers had evolved into one of the leading cloth operations in.

In spite of his immigrant background De la Court was able to penetrate the social elite of [[Holland]]. He became a close friend of Johan Eleman, who was a member of Leiden's governing council and a relative of [[Johan de Witt|John de Witt]], the de facto leader of the [[Dutch Republic]] between 1653 and 1672. In 1657 De la Court married Eleman's sister in law, Elisabeth Tollenaer, who died only one year later in childbirth. In 1660 death struck again, this time taking De la Court's younger brother and business partner Johan. Pieter was remarried in 1661, this time to Catharina van der Voort, the sister of two wealthy Amsterdam merchants and, again, a relative of John de Witt.

It was in this turbulent period of De la Court's life that he published almost all of his books about the [[political economy]] of [[Holland]] and the larger [[Dutch Republic]]. In the preface to the ''Interest van Holland'', the most renowned of these books, he explicitly ascribed this publishing frenzy to the need to distract his mind from the tragedy that had hit him. The centerpiece of this body of work was the ''Interest of Holland'', published in 1662. It contained a critical analysis of the economic success of the Dutch Republic and demonstrated how this success had been brought about by the combined effects of free competition and free (i.e. republican) government. It became a bestseller overnight. In Holland the ''Interest van Holland'' gained notoriety and infamy as a republican manifesto. Abroad the ''Interest'' was widely translated and read as an explanatory guide to the miraculous economic success of the Dutch.

De la Court's second wife Catharina van der Voort gave him two children, Magdalena (1661) and Pieter (1664), later named Pieter de la Court van der Voort. In 1665 the family moved from Leiden to [[Amsterdam]], by then the undisputed centre of world trade. There De la Court expanded the scope of his business activities by participating in the ventures of his two brothers in law.

De la Court became the leader of a consortium of Amsterdam merchants who sought to break the monopoly of the [[Dutch East India Company]] on all trade with the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The group filed petitions which claimed that the monopoly was limited to the trade route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In 1668 they actually sent an exploratory vessel to the Arctic to find a shipping route around Siberia. The endeavour failed but shows De la Court was an advocate of free trade in theory and practice.

De la Court's publishing activity had made him a well known protagonist of the republican "party" in contemporary Dutch politics. This group, consisting primarily of the wealthy businessmen in the cities of Holland and led by John de Witt, effectively ran the Dutch Republic from 1650 until 1672. They strongly opposed the political powers and ambitions of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] which usually held the office of [[Stadholder]], a pseudo-royal position that somehow survived in the otherwise republican institutions of the [[Dutch Republic]], except during this [[First Stadtholderless Period]]. De la Court was probably never close to John de Witt, but it has been established that De Witt was actively involved in the writing of De la Court's most outspoken and most widely read text, the ''Interest van Holland''.

When the Orangist faction regained control of the country in 1672, John de Witt was lynched by an [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangist]] mob and Pieter de la Court fled to Antwerp where he stayed with his brother in law Guglielmo van der Voort. He returned to Amsterdam in 1673 where he lived as a merchant until his death in 1685. The last book that was published by De la Court appeared in 1669. A final work, the ''Sinryke Fabulen'', was published posthumously in 1685.

==Works==
De la Court's works were published anonymously, but contemporaries immediately identified Pieter de la Court as the author of most of them. It is now generally believed that some of these books were actually written by his brother, Johan, and that at least one other title was the work of his business friend Johan Uytenhage de Mist. It has been established as a fact that John de Witt and a number of other government officials contributed to the ''Interest van Holland''. De la Court's ''oeuvre'' can be divided into three groups of titles.

===Political Economy===
The ''Interest van Holland'' was published in 1662 and immediately became a bestseller in Holland and later also elsewhere. The book contained an analysis of the miraculous economic success of Holland, the leading province of the Dutch Republic, and then set out to establish the economic and political principles on which that success was based. De la Court identified free competition and the republican form of government as the leading factors contributing to the wealth and power of his home country. The book was written in an outspoken and polemic style and went through eight editions in 1662. A revised luxury edition appeared in 1669. It was translated into German in 1665, English in 1702 and French in 1709. A new English translation appeared as late as 1746.

===Political Theory===
In 1660 De la Court published the ''Consideratien van Staet'' (Considerations of State), followed in 1662 by the ''Politike Discoursen''. Both titles seek to establish a theoretical basis for the superiority of the republican form of government. Although the texts share the ''Interest'''s republican penchant, they have an altogether different nature. The tone is subdued and the style philosophical
with extensive references to other political theorists. Both texts are now thought to have been written by De la Court's brother Johan.

===Political Pamphlets===
The third and most extensive part of De la Court's work is the series of republican and anti-monarchist pamphlets he published in 1662 and 1663. The most well-known are the ''Historie der gravelike regering in Holland'' (History of the counts of Holland) and ''De stadthouderlijcke regeeringe in Hollandt ende West-Vrieslandt'' (History of the stadholders of Holland and West-Friesland). Both books contain vivid albeit rather one-sided descriptions of the damage that had been done to the country by monarchical leaders since the Middle Ages.

==Influence==
The ''Interest van Holland'' is one of the preeminent textbooks of economic and political freedom in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The book was an immediate bestseller in the Dutch Republic and went through eleven editions between 1662 and 1671. The Dutch version was read in political circles throughout Europe and translations appeared in German (1665 and 1671), French (1709) and English (1702, 1743 and 1746). The book had a significant influence on political and economic thinking but its primary importance lay in the impact it had on office holders and political reality. The ''Interest van Holland'' was not a philosophical disquisition, but a recipe book for political and economic success.

===Dutch Republic 1662 - 1795===
Within the Dutch Republic the ''Interest van Holland'' became the ''de facto'' government manifesto of the republican oligarchy led by John de Witt until 1672. The ''Interest van Holland'' viciously attacked the pseudo-royal stadtholders. De Witt abolished the office in 1669. The ''Interest'' was wary of war and geographical expansion. The States of Holland neglected the army and sought to evade conflicts with their bigger neighbours. Instead the money was spent on a naval buildup, another ''Interest'' recommendation. At sea the military would not primarily be a cost, but a useful tool in protecting and promoting the commercial interests of the Republic and its rulers. Finally the ''Interest'' was vehemently opposed to monopoly, most notably the Dutch East and West India Companies and the guilds, the closed associations of craftsmen that controlled most manufacturing activity. The two trading companies, huge sovereign entities way beyond the control of the provincial and city governments of Holland, were immune to these attacks and survived all the way to the end of the Dutch Republic. But De la Court did play a role in the demise of the [[guilds]] that were increasingly seen as obstacles to economic innovation and growth. The regime of De Witt ended in 1672. The ''Interest van Holland'' remained a leading source of republican inspiration until the dissolution of the [[Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden]] in 1795.

===Europe and United States 1662 - 1789===
The ''Interest van Holland'' was widely read in Europe for a number of reasons. When the book appeared it stirred the curiosity of political rulers throughout the continent because it was seen as a look into the backrooms of the Dutch political and economic machinery. Later the text was espoused by supporters of free trade and republicanism throughout Europe, for whom it remained a source of inspiration until the end of the eighteenth century. It is hard to overestimate the profound influence of the ''Interest van Holland'' on the European and American political elites of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as can be seen from numerous examples. The book was read and used by politicians as diverse as [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[James Madison]] and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]. It was quoted and discussed by free trade pamphleteers in Britain and [[Physiocrats]] in France. It can be assumed that the book was also one of the sources of inspiration also for [[Adam Smith]]'s ''Wealth of Nations''.

==Literature==
The text of the last English edition of the ''Interest'' can be downloaded from the website of the [[Liberty Fund]]: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=85&amp;Itemid=99999999  Pieter de la Court, ''The True Interest and Political Maxims, of the Republic of Holland (1662)''].
The leading source on De la Court's life and works is Ivo W. Wildenberg, ''Johan &amp; Pieter de la Court'' (Amsterdam &amp; Maarssen, 1986).

This table lists the [[Chemical element|elements]] by their name and gives some historical prices for them and their commonly traded compounds. The first of the two price columns shows the price in US dollars per kg of the compound specified. The second shows the [[USD]] price per kg of element in the compound.  Dates on prices facilitate [[Foreign exchange market|forex]] conversion.

Elements of only short [[Half-life|half-lives]] are unlikely to be traded on a secondary market outside of nuclear lab production, and were therefore excluded from the main table.  The current cutoff excludes elements with [[atomic number]] greater than 105.  They have no known isotope with a half-life greater than 1.5 hours and are listed separately later.

Prometic was founded in 1988, as a commercial spinoff of research at the University of Cambridge on [[affinity chromatography]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/ceo-of-the-year/most-innovative-ceo-pierre-laurin-prometic-life-sciences/|title=Most Innovative CEO of the Year: Pierre Laurin, Prometic|date=2015-10-19|work=Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its founder was the current President and CEO, Pierre Laurin, whose research formed the basis for the company's products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On May 19, 1998,the Corporation went public through a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In August 2016, the company announced the acquisition of [[Telesta Therapeutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/prometic-to-acquire-telesta-therapeutics/81253125/|title=ProMetic to Acquire Telesta Therapeutics - GEN|website=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==

Most of the company's products are based on its affinity chromatography process.  One use of this process is the purification of drugs, reducing impurities and thus side effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A second use is removing pathogens from human blood; in 2002, ProMetic formed a joint venture with the American Red Cross to remove pathogens and viruses from collected blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/prometic-to-team-with-red-cross/article4133590/|title=ProMetic to team with Red Cross|last=|first=|date=2002-04-22|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third application is to extract and purify therapeutic proteins from human plasma, which are then used in the creation of therapeutics and orphan drugs.

Prometic has two business segments: the protein technologies segment and the small-molecule therapeutics segment.

The small-molecule therapeutics segment produces products for sufferers of [[fibrosis]], [[cancer]] and [[autoimmune diseases]].  The company most prominent product is PBI-4050, an anti-fibrosis product. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/three-top-stock-picks-from-selective-assets-robert-mcwhirter/article20285042/|title=Three top stock picks from Selective Asset’s Robert McWhirter|last=|first=|date=2014-08-29|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4279">{{distinguish|Proxy war}}
A '''proxy fight''', '''proxy contest''' or '''proxy battle''', sometimes also called a '''proxy war''', is an unfriendly contest for the control over an organization. The event usually occurs when corporation's stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance, often focusing on directorial and management positions. Corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their [[Proxy voting|proxy votes]] (i.e., votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another) to install new management for any of a variety of reasons. Shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an [[Proxy firm|agent]] to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf. That agent is the shareholder's proxy.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ramseyer, and Bainbridge. Business Associations: Cases and Materials on Agency, Partnerships, and Corporations. (7th Ed.) Foundation Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a proxy fight, [[Incumbent#In business|incumbent]] directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change. These incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power, including: staggering the boards (i.e., having different election years for different directors), controlling access to the corporation's money, and creating restrictive requirements in the [[bylaws]]. As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful. However, it has been recently noted that proxy fights waged by [[hedge fund]]s are successful more than 60% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01432.x/full.html Klein, April and Zur, Emanuel. 2009. Entrepreneurial shareholder activism: Hedge funds and other private investors. Journal of Finance 64(1): 187-229.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*An acquiring company, frustrated by the [[Takeover#Tactics against hostile takeover|takeover defense]]s of the management, may initiate a proxy fight to install a more compliant management of the target.
*An early history of proxy fighting, detailing such 1950s battles as the fight for control of some of U.S. largest corporations, including the [[Bank of America]] and the [[New York Central Railroad]], can be found in [[David Karr]]'s 1956 volume, ''Fight for Control''.
*Stockholder dissidents opposed to an impending takeover in the view that it will dilute value may also use a proxy fight to stop it. An example of a proxy fight took place within [[Hewlett-Packard]], when the management of that company sought to take over [[Compaq]]. Opponents of the Compaq takeover lost the fight. The management, under [[Carly Fiorina]], remained in place, and the merger went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/03/20/fin_hp_declares_proxy.html HP declares proxy win]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the absence of any looming takeover, proxy fights can come about because dissidents are unhappy with management, as with [[Carl Icahn]]'s effort in 2005–2006 to oust a majority of the board of [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2006/01/31/frank-biondi-joins-carl-icahn-in-time-warner-proxy-fight Frank Biondi Joins Carl Icahn in Time Warner Proxy Fight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218183834/http://dmwmedia.com/news/2006/01/31/frank-biondi-joins-carl-icahn-in-time-warner-proxy-fight |date=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key players==
Due to their out-sized influence with many institutional investors, [[proxy advisor]]s play a key role in many proxy fights. In many cases, the proxy firms end up determining the result of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/protecting-shareholders-from-activist-proxies-1432860067 Protecting Shareholders From Activist Proxies HP declares proxy win]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32219">The '''Public Administration of Spain''' is the governmental apparatus that manages the [[Spain|Spanish]] public interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martín Rebollo|first1=Luis|title=Leyes Administrativas|isbn=978-84-9135-888-6|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] declares in article 103.1 that the Public Administration serves objectively the general interests and acts in accordance with the principles of [[efficiency]], [[hierarchy]], [[decentralization]], deconcentration and coordination, with full submission to the [[Law of Spain|Law]].

The Law 40/2015, of October 2, about the Juridical Regime of the Public Sector, establish that are Public Administration the ''[[General State Administration]], the [[Administrations of the Autonomous Communities]], the Entities that integrate the Local Administration, as well as the public organisms and the entities of public law''.

The structure of the Public Administration of Spain is composed of many Administrations, which can be divided into three groups: Territorial administrations (this are the administrations that needs territory to exist like the [[General State Administration]]), the Instrumental or Institutional Administrations (the key to exist is the personnel) and the Corporative Administrations (group of people of the same guild that sometimes they do activities of a public nature)

The Public administrations, in their task of satisfying the [[Common good|general interest]], hold a series of exorbitant powers with respect to legal persons of a private nature. As a counterweight to such exorbitant powers, Administrations are subject to a set of limits and guarantees of the [[rule of law]] (submission to the law, [[judicial review]], property guarantees, etc.).

==Regulation==
===Basic regulation===
The main axis of the basic regulation of the Public Administration is the Law 39/2015, of October 1, about the Common Administrative Process of the Public Administrations and Law 40/2015, of October 2, about the Juridical Regime of the Public Sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10566&amp;p=20151002&amp;tn=2 Ley 40/2015, de 1 de octubre, de Régimen Jurídico del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565 Ley 39/2015, de 1 de octubre, del Procedimiento Administrativo Común de las Administraciones Públicas.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other laws that affect all the Public Administrations are Law 33/2003, about the Patrimony of the Public Administrations, Law 38/2003, about Public Subsidies, the [[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]] 5/2015, about the Basic Statute of the Public Employee and [[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]] 3/2011, about Public Sector Contracts.

===Development regulation===
Apart from the bases, there are other laws that develop and implement the previous ones like Law 6/1997, about Organization and Functioning of the General State Administration and Law 50/1997, of November 27, about the Government.

In the autonomous field, the Administrations of the [[Autonomous Communities]] are subject to their respective autonomous laws, in development of the basic state regulation mentioned above. It should be noted that local administrations (such as a [[town hall]]) do not have [[legislative power]] but [[regulatory authority]].

==Organization==
The Spanish Public Administrations has a decentralized character as the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]] says. There are not a hierarchy criterion between administrations but a competencial criterion. This means that every administations has its competencies and another administration can not influence them because it is not competent. There are around 10,000 public administrations in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeconomyjournal.com/texto-diario/mostrar/591729/espana-casi-10000-administraciones-publicas En España, casi 10.000 Administraciones públicas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial administrations===
Administrations, depending on the territory in which they are competent, are classified into three levels. The first level is the [[General State Administration]] which competencies spread throughout the [[Spain|country]]. The second level is made up of the different [[Autonomous Communities Administration|Autonomous Administrations]]. Its competences cover the territory of the corresponding [[Autonomous Community]]. Finally, the third level are the Local Administrations develop their powers over the corresponding municipal or provincial term, depending on whether it is a [[Municipality |Municipality]] or a [[Province |Province]].

It must be understood that the three levels differ because they are legally different, insofar as each one has its own [[legal personality]]. It is what is known as public entity, in front of the internal structure of the same, the so-called ''organs'', considered as each of the functional units of the public entity.

===Instrumental or Institutional administrations===
Together with the three territorial administrative levels, there is an extremely heterogeneous group of Administrations with a purely instrumental or institutional character (Institutional Administration), dependent on a parent administration. The plurality of territorial administrations allows them to be created with their own administrative [[legal personality]], different from the parent administration, for the exercise of certain competences. Unlike the parent or creative administration, which has a political character, the instrumental or institutional administration has a strong [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] character.

==Patrimony==
The patrimony of the Administration has its essential regulation in the article 132 of the Constitution, as well as in the Law 33/2003, of November 3, of the Patrimony of the Public Administrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2003-20254 Ley 33/2003, de 3 de noviembre, del Patrimonio de las Administraciones Públicas.]&lt;/ref&gt; The assets and rights of said Administrations may be classified, according to article 4 of Law 33/2003, in public domain goods and private domain goods.

The money, securities, credits and other financial resources of its finances are not considered patrimony of the Administration nor, in the case of public business entities and similar entities dependent on the autonomous communities or local corporations, the resources constituting their treasury.

===Public domain goods===
Public domain assets are those that are publicly owned but are used for general use or [[public service]]. Public property is also considered to be the dependencies and offices of State bodies, as well as the maritime-terrestrial zone, the [[Beaches of Spain|beaches]], the [[territorial sea]] and the natural resources of the [[Exclusive economic zone|economic zone]] and the [[continental shelf]].

===Private domain goods===
Patrimonial assets or private domain are all those assets owned by the state that do not fall within the category of public domain assets. In this way, ''[[leasing|leasing rights]], securities representing shares and shares in the capital of commercial companies or of bonds issued by them, as well as futures and options contracts whose underlying assets consist of shares or participations in commercial entities, [[Incorporeal property|incorporeal property rights]], and rights of any nature arising from the ownership of the assets and [[economic rights]]''.

===Special Properties===
====Communal goods====
The communal goods are assigned to a general use and use by the neighbors of a certain [[municipality]]. The [[Town Hall]] and neighbors are co-owners of the property, having the right to use and enjoy direct and simultaneous neighborhood, whenever possible. If this is not the case, [[local ordinances]] and custom will determine the regime of use and use of [[communal property]].

====Neighborhood forests in common hand====
The ''neighborhood forests in common hand'' are a special category of property, whose ownership and use corresponds to those who are at any moment neighbors of a certain place (without the intervention of the [[Town Hall]]). The management will also be carried out by these through [[Neighborhood association|neighborhood assemblies]].

====National Heritage====
The [[Patrimonio Nacional|National Heritage]] is constituted by goods and rights reserved for the use and enjoyment of the members of the [[Spanish royal family|Royal House]]. They have a marked public domain, and an intense protection that makes them more inalienable than the common public domain goods.

There is no assumption that the assets and rights of the National Heritage can be removed from their public domain character to be converted into patrimonial assets (private law) and subsequently alienated.

==Public employment==
[[Public employee|Public employment]] comprises all the cases in which the Administration makes use of natural persons so that, in return for [[remuneration]], they work for the account of the body or entity to which they are attached. The basic regulations are found in Law 5/2005, of April 12, about the Basic Statute of the Public Employee. Four general classes of public employees are regulated: career officials, interim officials, labor staff and eventual staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-11719 Real Decreto Legislativo 5/2015, de 30 de octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Estatuto Básico del Empleado Público.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career officials===
The backbone of public employment rests on career [[official]]s, people linked to the Administration by a statutory relationship. Their access to the public function is carried out by opposition or competition (such as via exams and through open competition for vacancies), and their separation is limited to certain cases contemplated in the legislation.

===Interim officials===
The Interim officials or Temporary officials enjoy, as well as career officials, a statutory relationship with the Administration. His access and separation from the [[public service]] also follow the same guidelines, differing from the career official in the provisional character, as opposed to the alleged stability of the former.

===Labor staff===
The massive incorporation of labor staff in the service of the Public Administration is a relatively recent phenomenon. Its relationship with the Administration is not statutory, like the one of the civil servants, but by [[Work contract|contract]]. Its legal regime is governed by the rules of [[administrative law]], something that does not preclude the application of the common [[labor law]] regime. In its contracting and dismissal, the principles of [[Equality (law)|equality]], [[publicity]], merit and [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] must continue to be respected.

The Administration can not freely contract labor staff, but must adjust to the jobs that the law allows.
===Eventual staff===
Eventual staff are [[public employees]] who have been appointed on a discretionary basis to perform a series of special functions or advice in the administrative apparatus of the State. Their general character is of non-permanent workers and they can be fired freely by the authority of which they depend or that made his appointment. In any case, they cease when the authority they consult is ceased.

==Administrative Procedure==
The Public Administration governs its action on the basis of a series of rules that [[Coercivity|coercively]] impose a procedure, making administrative acts subject to a ritual form. Both the decisions taken and the way in which they are carried out must be carried out through formal procedures, a concept inherited from [[Francia|French]] legal doctrine.

Among the functions of the [[administrative procedure]], it is worth mentioning its role as a source of administrative predictability. In this way, it is considered desirable that the performance of the Administration is moderately predictable, for the sake of [[legal certainty]]. On the other hand, imposing a series of formal guidelines reduces the spaces in which the professional officials must act in an excessively creative way (something typical of positions of political trust), with the consequent reduction of [[arbitrariness]] in the management of [[Public interest|Public affairs]]. By regulating the procedure, it will be possible to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative action without affecting labor pressures, which are possible in the private organization, but completely unthinkable in a contemporary Public Administration that operates on a [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and regulated basis, safe from the changes that come with the political future.

==Public Procurement Regime==
The [[public administration]] usually uses the contracting mechanism with individuals to carry out an immense variety of tasks. However, the contracting regime differs from that provided for contracting between individuals, traditionally governed by [[Civil law (Civil law)|civil law]]. When the administration acts as a contractor, a specific contracting regime must be used, in which [[administrative law]] plays a fundamental and indispensable role.

[[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]] 3/2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2011-17887 Real Decreto Legislativo 3/2011, de 14 de noviembre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Contratos del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt; about Contracts of the public sector is responsible for regulating public procurement, guaranteeing the principles of free access to tender, publicity and transparency of the procedure, equality of treatment between candidates and efficiency in public expenditure. To ensure the latter, a prior definition of the need to satisfy, free competition between tenderers, and the choice of the most economically advantageous tender are required.

==Patrimonial liability regime==
The Public Administration of Spain responds patrimonially of certain type of damages that produce incidentally as a consequence of the administrative action. The principle of patrimonial guarantee of the individual against the Administration is consecrated by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], specifically in article 106.

===Characteristics===
The administrative responsibility is complete, so that it covers all the damages produced by any public power, not only the Administration proper. It is also a direct responsibility, so that the injured party will not have to go against the official who has performed the harmful action, but against the Administration itself, directly, and in no case subsidiary. The Administration, in turn, may punish the official in case of [[dolus]], [[negligence]] or [[Guilt (law)|guilt]].

===Requirements===
====Redeemable Injury====
One of the most basic presupposition for which there is responsibility on the part of the Administration is the existence of a qualified damage to the [[property]] or [[rights]] of a [[Natural person|natural]] or [[legal person]]. Point out that not only refers to pecuniary goods, but also of another nature, such as moral damages, which in the case will also involve a [[pecuniary|pecuniary]] compensation.

Among the qualities that administrative damage must meet in order to comply with this requirement, it is necessary to emphasize, first of all, the illegality of the action of the Administration. Unlike the regime of responsibility regulated in the [[Civil Code]], where the illegality occurs when there is [[fraud]] or [[Guilt (law)|guilt]], in the system of objective responsibility of the Administration, the criterion of illegality focuses on the existence or nonexistence of a duty to support the damage that laws can attribute to subjects. If the victim of administrative damage had no duty to bear it, the injury will be unlawful. Otherwise, the responsibility of the Administration will not arise, and the private individual will be responsible for the damage (it will be the case of [[taxes]], in which the subject suffers property damage, but as a consequence of a law that empowers the Public authority to effect such an injury, and therefore exempts it from liability.)

The experts also speak of the need for the damage to be effective, referring to current and actual damages, and ruling out compensation for future or merely possible damages. Similarly, there is no liability when the damage consists in the mere frustration of expectations, provided that such expectations do not have a highly tangible probability of becoming an increase in [[property]] or [[rights]].

On the other hand, the damage must be economically evaluable. However, this does not mean that only damage to property or property rights is compensated, because in a conventional way, personal and moral damage (pretium doloris) can also be assessed.

The damage must be individualized, it may be a single person or a small group, but never a group of such magnitude that can not be concretized who receive the damage.

====Imputation of injury====
The damage must have been produced by an official or employee of the Administration, or by one of the organs of political trust. In addition, it must occur as a result of acting within the public functions performed by such persons. However, damages caused by contractors and concessionaires of the Administration are excluded, unless the injury was caused by a clause imposed by the latter, so that the individual was obliged to cause the damage in question. Likewise, exceptions are included in which a professional with public functions responds personally, as may be the case of the [[notary]].

On the other hand, analyzing the formal characteristics of the damage, it is necessary to emphasize that four types of actions (and omissions) can be found. Thus, damage can come from the regulatory activity of the Administration, some of its administrative acts, a purely material administrative action or the inactivity of the Administration.

====Causal link====
The cause-effect relationship seems to be an obvious and simple requirement in the framework of the liability of the Public Administration for damages in its action. However, the causes of harm are often not unique, nor are they clearly related. Throughout history, three different theories have been applied, focused essentially on resolving cases in which there is a concurrence of causes, which by the way, are the most common assumptions.

At first, the theory of exclusive causality predominated, which only held the Administration responsible when its performance was the sole and exclusive cause of the injury. Obviously, the assumptions in which the Administration is the exclusive cause of harm are very small, and the theory was extremely advantageous for the public body, since it rarely had to compensate.

In later moments the theory of equivalence of the conditions would be applied, which affirmed that all the factors that caused the injury have equal importance, taking into account that the absence of any of them would have meant the absence of such an [[injury]]. It concluded that the total compensation could be demanded from any of the causal sources that caused the damage, having to repeat the defendant against the other causes. With this, a kind of tacit [[solidarity]] was established in which the interest of the damaged subject prevailed, in spite of the [[arbitrariness]] of the system.

Finally, the theory of adequate causality, in which the corresponding court selects from among the causes that is suitable to provoke the injury, and decisive for it to occur. The reparation of damage is still given absolute priority, although on this occasion, the person causing the damage, who pays the total compensation and repeats it against the other offenders, is not arbitrarily selected, but based on the degree to which acting involved in the production of the lesion.

Among the cases in which there is a concurrence of causes, three types may be mentioned. First, when the victim has contributed in causing the damage, the compensation of the Administration was reduced in equal proportion to the degree of intervention of the injured subject. If there is intentionality or gross [[negligence]] in the action of the victim, the Administration does not have to compensate. In addition, full compensation is allowed for cases where the administrative action was notoriously disproportionate (a [[protest]] in which the [[riot police]] carried fire with the lethal ammunition).

The second case of causes is that in which the action of a third party, alien to the victim and the Administration, assists in causing the damage. Normally, in these cases, the Administration is obliged to fully indemnify the injured party, especially when the third party can not be identified.

The third and last possibility is that in which several Public Administrations concur in the causation of the damage. When the damage has occurred in the context of a joint action between Administrations, the regime that may provide for the instrument regulating such joint action will be taken first and, in the absence thereof, the principle of solidarity will govern, so that the Administration against which the victim wishes to act will compensate. In the event that it is not a joint action, liability shall be fixed for each Administration independently, and where such determination is not possible, joint and several liability shall govern.

==Administrative review==
The Public Administration has a series of mechanisms by which it tries to self-correct its own action. The administrative review is a method to rectify those acts that suffer from some vice of illegality, being also an indispensable prerequisite for the individual who wishes to access the contentious-administrative (In [[Spain]], it is the [[jurisdictional]] level that deals with the conflicts of the Administration with the [[citizens]]), which this time, it is a reviewer of judicial nature.

Thus, there are three basic categories by which the Administration can perform the review of its own acts. First, the [[ex officio]] review, initiated (with exceptions) by the Administration itself in order to review its actions.

Next would be the administrative [[appeal]], a system of contentious character whose initiation is made at the request of the interested parties, and which intends to review an administrative act. The administrative appeal is a prerequisite for access to contentious-administrative jurisdiction.

Finally, there is the previous complaint, a very similar system to the administrative appeal, which also has an initiation at the request of the interested party, but whose object is an underlying conflict between the individual and the Administration (not necessarily an administrative act). 

===Ex officio review===
As previously stated, the [[ex officio |ex officio]] review is a quasi-exclusive mechanism of Spanish [[Administrative Law]] that allows the Public Administration to review its acts [[motu proprio]], without the need for an individual to urge such a review.

The ex officio review will proceed in four different assumptions. First, the existence of an act or regulation that can be considered [[null and void]] by law; Then, the review of an annulable declarative act of rights; Also the revocation of an act of taxation; And finally the correction of material and arithmetical errors.

===Administrative appeal===
The administrative appeal is that administrative act exercised preferably at the request of a party (the administrator) to obtain the modification, revocation or invalidation of an administrative resolution, generally when it causes a tort to the administered.

===Economic-Administrative Courts===
The Economic-Administrative Courts are a special courts unique from Spain that resolve the economic-administrative claims that has the objective of challenging the tax acts before the Administration itself.

==Contentious-administrative review==
If, in the administrative review, the Administration verified the legality of its own acts, the contentious-administrative procedure results in a verification of the legality of the administrative act by independent courts belonging to the [[Judiciary of Spain|judicial branch]].

{{quote|"The Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction is a key piece of our Rule of Law. Since it was established on our country by the Laws of April 2 and July 6, 1845, and through many vicissitudes, has given a good sample of its virtues since the Act of 27 December 1956, which endowed it with the characteristics that it has today and of the attributions essential to assume its mission to control the legality of administrative activity, guaranteeing the rights and legitimate interests of The citizens against the excess of the Administration."|author=Explanatory Memorandum of the Law of Contentious Administrative Jurisdiction of 1998.}}

Not only administrative acts are challenging, but also the general provisions issued by the Administration, the absence of due administrative action and even ways of doing things. Contentious-administrative control is an important component of the [[rule of law]], since it guarantees the supremacy of the legal norms on the regulatory norms and the action (or omission) of the Public Administration.

This principle, according to its importance, is enshrined in Article 106.1 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], which states that the courts control the regulatory power and the legality of administrative action, as well as submitting it to the purposes that justify it.

===Object===
When referring to the subject of the contentious-administrative appeal, reference is made to that which can be challenged before the Contentious Administrative-Jurisdiction.

In the first place, any general provision issued by the Administration by virtue of its regulatory power is subject to contentious review. Likewise, it is possible to resort to the contentious-administrative appeal to review the mere material actions of the Administration. Finally, it can be claimed against the only passivity or administrative omission in situations that legally require its activity.

===Subject===
The rules on the standing to file a contentious-administrative appeal are set out in articles 19 and 20 of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction.

According to article 19, they are entitled to appeal:
* The [[Natural person|natural]] and [[legal persons]] that hold a right of legitimate interest.
* The groups of affected, unions without personality and independent or autonomous patrimonies that have a right or legitimate interest.
* Territorial administrations (general, autonomous and local).
* The instrumental administrations that have a legitimate right or interest.
* The [[Spanish Attorney General|Attorney General's Office]] for cases legally envisaged.
* Any [[citizen]], in those cases in which the Law allows the popular action.

It also contemplates those situations in which the affected are a plurality of people indeterminate or difficult to determine, in which case the standing to sue in defense of these diffuse interests will be exclusively the public bodies with jurisdiction in the matter, Unions and state-level associations whose primary purpose is [[Gender equality|equality between women and men]].

The appeal of an administrative body against the Administration of which it forms part is not allowed. Nor will it be possible for a member of a collegiate body to appeal against its own administration. It will not be acceptable for an Entity governed by public law to challenge the decision of the Administration on which it depends or with which it is bound.

===Contentious-administrative procedure===
The contentious-administrative procedure is the result of a set of formal rules of a [[Procedural law|procedural]] nature that form the channel to be followed to settle the [[lawsuit]], and to apply the substantive rules, which are the ones that ultimately must determine the merits of the matter.

====Ordinary procedure====
It is initiated by a brief reduced to citing the provision, act, inactivity or action constituting a [[de facto]] route that is contested and to request that the appeal be filed.

Once the procedure has been initiated, the court will require the Administration to forward the administrative file and to place the interested parties thereon by means of a notification that it will follow the rules established for the common administrative procedure. The administrative file will be placed in the hands of the [[appellant]] so that within 20 days, he files a writ of complaint, this time yes, with all the arguments and legal reasoning that he has deduced from the file. If there is no referral of the file, the Law raises multiple measures to compel the Administration, ranging from the impossibility of answering without accompanying file until the personal fine to the official or authority responsible for sending.

Once the claim has been filed by the appellant, it will be transferred to the defendants, who will also have a period of 20 days to respond. Both the demand and the answer must respect a structure with the proper separation of the facts, the grounds of Law and the claims that are deduced.

When there is disagreement about the facts and these have significance for the resolution of the lawsuit, the process will be tested. The evidence can be given at the request of a party or ex officio by the court. The general provisions issued in the field of evidence for civil proceedings are followed, although the deadline for proposing it will be fifteen days, and thirty days for it to be practiced.

At the end of the trial period, or not having occurred, the parties may request that a hearing be held, that conclusions be presented or that the suit be declared conclusive, without further formalities, for judgment.

Once the process of hearing or conclusions is concluded, and unless the court decides to practice additional evidence, the suit shall be declared final for judgment.

===Appeals===
====Ordinary appeal====
It is a appeal that is filed in order for a resolution to be revoked, by court or authority higher than the one that dictated it.
====Cassation appeal====
Appeal filed before the Supreme Court against final judgments, in which laws or legal doctrine are alleged to have been violated, or any essential procedural guarantee breached.
====Reviewal appeal====
It is the most extraordinary resource that knows the order of the contentious-administrative. It is filed when a judgment has already been issued and is requested to be reviewed by the appearance of new cases.

The law establishes 4 assumptions that allow to appeal this resource:
* If, after pronouncement of the judgment, decisive documents are recovered, not contributed by [[force majeure]] or by the party in whose favor it was given.
* If it had fallen on the basis of documents which, at the time of its being pronounced, were unaware of one of the parties having been recognized and declared to be false or whose falsity was recognized or later declared.
* If it has been issued by witness evidence, the witnesses have been convicted of [[false testimony]] given in the statements that served as the basis of the sentence.
* Information and communications technologyIf a judgment has been given by virtue of [[bribery]], [[Deception|prevarication]], [[violence]] or other fraudulent machinations.

Prior to the publication of ''The ONE Thing'' in 2013, the two collaborated on ''The Millionaire Real Estate'' series of books which discussed how to invest in and earn money from real estate properties.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite news | last=Coles Johnson| first=Donna Maria| title =November 2013 Indie Business Book Club: The ONE Thing by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Indie Business Network | date =1 November 2013 | url =http://www.indiebusinessnetwork.com/book-club-the-one-thing-by-indie-business-network-founder-and-ceo-donna-maria/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The ONE Thing'' is the duo's first book that is not specifically focused on real estate. Instead, it discusses the general business principle of choosing a single task to work on to theoretically maximize the efficiency of that task and the overall project.&lt;ref name="Kirkus"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =The One Thing| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''| date =15 March 2013 | url =https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gary-keller/the-one-thing/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quartz"&gt;{{cite news | last=Elmer| first=Vickie| title =Forget the long to-do lists and choose one thing to be good at| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]| date =19 April 2013 | url =http://qz.com/75571/the-path-to-success-choose-one-thing-to-be-good-at/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zoia"&gt;{{cite news | last=Zoia| first=Robert| title =The One Thing: The surprisingly simple truth behind extraordinary results, by Gary Keller (Book Review)| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Zoia.org| date =15 January 2015 | url =http://zoia.org/2015/01/15/the-one-thing-the-surprisingly-simple-truth-behind-extraordinary-results-by-gary-keller-book-review/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The book discusses the benefits of prioritizing a single task, and it also provides examples of how to engage in those tasks with a singular focus.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; The book begins with a section entitled, "The Lies: They Mislead and Derail Us," which analyzes the ways in which multitasking has erroneously been praised as a desirable trait.&lt;ref name="Blu"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =The Business Book Review: The ONE Thing, Gary Keller| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Blu Pagoda| date =5 May 2015 | url =http://www.blupagoda.com/blog/2015/5/5/the-business-book-review-the-one-thing-gary-keller| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also challenge the concept of "work-life balance", calling it "[i]dealistic, but not realistic."&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

This then leads to the "Focusing Question" which asks "What’s the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?" This second section of the book deals with productivity principles like habit-building and benchmarking.&lt;ref name="Blu"/&gt; For instance, the book suggests that readers should engage in four hours of work on their "ONE thing" each day.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite news | last=Brady| first=Arlo| title =The ONE Thing | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[The Huffington Post]] | date =13 October 2013 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-arlo-brady/the-one-thing_1_b_3732007.html| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors cite [[economist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]] as one of the inspirations behind this philosophy. Pareto's principle suggested that 20% of the effort produces 80% of the results. According to the book, this means that engaging in the one most important task will be more likely to produce the desired results without any extraneous effort.&lt;ref name="PStar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quartz"/&gt; The book also differentiates between the Big-Picture Question ("What’s my ONE Thing?") and the Small-Focus Question ("What’s my ONE Thing right now?").&lt;ref name="Blu"/&gt; The core idea is that focusing on an excessive amount of tasks will more likely lead to discord and under-performance.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite news | last=Maresca| first=Joseph S.| title =Book Review: The One Thing by Gary Keller, Jay Papasan | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Blogcritics]] | date =18 May 2013 | url =http://blogcritics.org/book-review-the-one-thing-by/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atiim"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rotenberg| first=Zorian| title =Book Insights from The ONE Thing by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Atiim| date =14 January 2016 | url =https://www.atiim.com/blog/the-one-thing-by-gary-keller-and-jay-papasan/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third section of the book discusses "Extraordinary Results," which details how to make the above principles actionable. One of the concepts it illustrates is "time blocking," which means that one should focus on only their ONE thing during a given amount of time. It also suggests that readers should schedule time to reflect, plan, and even relax. Everything else during scheduled time blocks is characterized as a distraction. Each section of the book is followed up by a "Big Ideas" review that gives a summary of the sections' concepts and principles.&lt;ref name="Blu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EntreTime"&gt;{{cite news | last=Vozza| first=Stephanie| title =Time Blocking: a Productivity Power Tool | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]''| date =8 April 2013 | url =https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226231| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

''The ONE Thing'' garnered success both critically and commercially. It was listed as a best seller by ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'',&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; ''USA Today'', and Amazon.com.&lt;ref name="Howes"/&gt; [[Hudson Booksellers]] listed it among their best "Business Interest" books of 2013.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Hudson Booksellers Announces the Best Books of 2013 | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Digital Journal| date =12 November 2013 | url =http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1582146| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', Brandon Turner named ''The ONE Thing'' one of the "5 Powerful Books That Changed the Direction of My Life."&lt;ref name="Entre5"&gt;{{cite news | last=Turner| first=Brandon| title =5 Powerful Books That Changed the Direction of My Life  | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]''| date =25 March 2015 | url =https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244123| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', Alice Haine notes that the book "has the necessary ingredients to boost those feeling a little overwhelmed by the pressures of work and home life."&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite news | last=Haine| first=Alice| title =Actions speak louder than to-do lists | newspaper =''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]''| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =24 July 2013 | url =http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/the-life/actions-speak-louder-than-to-do-lists| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on [[Blogcritics]] states "[t]his book will benefit management at virtually every level in an organization."&lt;ref name="BC"/&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted that book had "an appealing style and energy."&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; It has won a total of 12 book awards and been translated into 26 languages.

A '''trade sale''' is a common means of exit to a [[trade]] buyer. This allows the management to withdraw from the business and may open up the prospect of collaboration on larger projects. The term trade sale is mostly used in the context of venture capital funded businesses and refers to the sale of a company in its early stages. 

It normally entails the disposal of a company's [[shares]] or [[assets]] and even liabilities, in whole or in part. This may refer to a strategic buyer who intends to grow theirs business or to a financial buyer who wants to generate a financial return on their invested capital at the time of exit. 

Trade sales are the most frequently used to exit vehicle both in Europe and the US.

The term trade sale may also refer to [[business-to-business]] sales, rather than sales made directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=trade-sale|title=Trade Sale Definition from Financial Times Lexicon|website=lexicon.ft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Transport}}

'''Transport''' or '''transportation''' is the movement of humans, animals and [[cargo|goods]] from one location to another. In other words the action of transportation is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to the Point B.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[Ground transportation|land]] ([[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport|road]]), [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s and [[business operations|operations]]. Transport is important because it enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of [[civilization]]s.

Transport [[infrastructure]] consists of the fixed installations, including [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway stations]], [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s) and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.

Vehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobile]]s, [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[watercraft]], [[spacecraft]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]].

Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.

Passenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and [[globalization]], but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain [[urban sprawl]].

==History==
{{Main|History of transport}}
[[File:Bronocice drawn.png|thumb|[[Bronocice pot]] with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world, found in [[Poland]]]]
[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]
Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of [[vehicle]]s. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The first forms of [[road transport]] involved animals, such as [[horse]]s ([[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), [[ox]]en (from about 8000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;

or humans carrying goods over [[dirt]] tracks that often followed [[game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s. Many early civilizations, including those in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], constructed paved roads.  In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.

[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in [[rail transport]], made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased rapidly, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], which sped up global transport.

With the development of the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first "modern" highways were constructed during the 19th century{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} with [[macadam]]. Later, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] demonstrated the first successful controllable [[airplane]], and after World War I (1914–1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II (1939–1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.&lt;ref name=cooper277&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of [[containerization]] gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=bcn21114&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211–14&lt;/ref&gt; International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the [[jet engine]]. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines.&lt;ref name=cooper277 /&gt;

Early in [[U.S. history]],{{when|date=February 2016}} [[privately held company|private]] [[joint-stock]] [[corporations]] owned most [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[bridge]]s, [[canals]], [[railroads]], [[roads]], and [[tunnels]]. Most such transportation infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the [[nationalization]] of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of [[Amtrak]]. Recently,{{when|date=February 2016}} however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some{{quantify|date=February 2016}} ground and adherents.&lt;ref&gt;

{{further|Timeline of transportation technology}}

==Mode==
{{Main|Mode of transport}}
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.

===Human-powered===
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}
[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]
Human-powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transportation]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].

===Animal-powered===
{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}
Animal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.

===Air===
{{Main|Aviation}}
[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]].|alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine]]
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft.

Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.

The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places [[helicopter]]s can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 28, 2009, ''The Guardian'' article notes that, "the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land===
{{Main|Ground transportation}}
Land transport covers all land-based transportation systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.

====Rail====
{{Main|Rail transport}}
[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[InterCityExpress]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train|alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside]]
[[File:R160A E Train entering World Trade Center.jpg|thumb|right|The [[New York City Subway]] is the world's largest [[rapid transit]] system by length of routes and by number of [[train station|stations]].]]

Rail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].

A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.

[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al'', 1998: 279&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. [[Freight trains]] traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, [[container train]]s have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.

====Road====
{{Main|Road transport}}
[[File:Harborfreeway2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Harbor Freeway]] is often heavily congested at rush hour in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].]]
A road is an identifiable [[route number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].&lt;ref Name="Major_Roads_of_the_United_States"&gt;{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |date=2006-03-13 |url=http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413153426/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |archivedate=13 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;&lt;ref Name="RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url=http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063243/http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;Lay, 1992: 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.&lt;ref name="difference_between_road_and_street"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.
Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.

Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278&lt;/ref&gt; Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.

===Water===
{{Main|Ship transport}}
[[File:Negombo canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fishermen to get to the sea, [[Negombo]] Dutch canal, [[Sri Lanka]]]]
[[File:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|Automobile ferry in [[Croatia]]|alt=White ferry with ramps in the up-position, moored at jetty]]
Water transport is movement by means of a [[watercraft]]—such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]]—over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.

In the 19th century, the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced in a [[boiler]] using wood or [[coal]] and fed through a steam [[external combustion engine]]. Now most ships have an [[internal combustion engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engines]] to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See [[Marine propulsion]].)

Although it is slow compared to other transportation, modern [[sea transport]] is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. [[Commercial vessel]]s, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&amp;nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[short sea shipping]] and [[ferry|ferries]] remain viable in coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other modes===
[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] for [[crude oil]]|alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped]]
[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].

[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[Wire rope|cables]] instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.

[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.

[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant "other place" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.

==Elements==

===Infrastructure===
{{Main|Infrastructure}}
[[File:GoldenGateBridge BakerBeach MC.jpg|thumb|Bridges, such as [[Golden Gate Bridge]], allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water.]]
Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] and [[sea lane|seaway]] do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.

Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275–76&lt;/ref&gt; For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.

The [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as [[landing fees]] at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and Søren L. Buhl, "How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'' '''71''':2, pp. 131–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
{{Main|Vehicle}}
[[File:1992 Fiat Uno IE 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|A [[Fiat Uno]] in 2018]]
A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].

Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.

===Operation===
[[File:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea|alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to "arms" that extend from the central building]]
Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]]. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 422&lt;/ref&gt; but ports can be public-owned.&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy===
As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population - according to the United Nations, 55% of the world’s population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meredith |first=Sam |date=2018-5-17 |title=Two-thirds of global population will live in cities by 2050, UN says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/two-thirds-of-global-population-will-live-in-cities-by-2050-un-says.html |work=CNBC |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public transportation policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S038611121400017X |title=The evolution of urban mobility: The interplay of academic and policy perspectives |last=Jones |first=Peter |date=July 2014 |website=Science Direct |access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of policy enforces order in transportation, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.

==Functions==
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.

===Passenger===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Passenger transportation"; if the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. --&gt;
{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}
[[File:ACTION Bus-467.jpg|thumb|A local transit bus operated by [[ACTION]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]|alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi-story building.]]
Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], leisure or [[human migration|migration]].

Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and [[rapid transit]] in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]].

Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[demand-responsive transport]], offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.

[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.

===Medical transport===
[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|An ambulance from World War I]]An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, "The Origin of Medical Terms". Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going "emergency ambulances", which form part of [[emergency medical service]]s, administering [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] to those with acute medical problems.

''Air medical services'' is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transportation to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.&lt;ref name="pmid15928284"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Branas CC, MacKenzie EJ, Williams JC, Schwab CW, Teter HM, Flanigan MC | title=Access to trauma centers in the United States. | journal=JAMA | year= 2005 | volume= 293 | issue= 21 | pages= 2626–33 | pmid=15928284 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2626 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15928284  |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7832345"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Burney RE, Hubert D, Passini L, Maio R | title=Variation in air medical outcomes by crew composition: a two-year follow-up. | journal=Ann Emerg Med | year= 1995 | volume= 25 | issue= 2 | pages= 187–92 | pmid=7832345 | doi= 10.1016/s0196-0644(95)70322-5|doi-access=free| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=7832345  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freight===
{{Main|Shipping}}

Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the [[value chain]] in manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3&lt;/ref&gt; With increased specialization and [[globalization]], production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Transportation creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]]]
[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[International trade|international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering a huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=bcn21114 /&gt;

[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, [[cereals]] and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.

[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to mail, common items sent by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.

==Impact==
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}

===Economic===
{{Main|Transport economics}}
[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.|alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area.]]

Transport is a key necessity for [[Departmentalization|specialization]]—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.  Throughout history transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 2&lt;/ref&gt; But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land and is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.

Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.

===Planning===
{{Main|Transport planning}}

Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is also studied through [[transport economics]], a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handled through [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]].

[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving.|alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey]]
Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transportation some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transportation facilities consume land, and in cities, pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.

Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput means that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places, and as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociologists as well as economists—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.

{{Main|Transport and the environment}}

Transport is a major use of [[energy (society)|energy]] and burns most of the world's [[petroleum]]. This creates air pollution, including [[nitrous oxide]]s and [[particulate]]s, and is a significant contributor to [[global warming]] through emission of [[carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref name = "pnas_pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0702958104v1.pdf |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |author=Fuglestvet et al., [[Center for International Climate and Environmental Research]] |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |title=Analysis: Nano Hypocrisy? |author=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |date=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jan Fuglestvedt et al. |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |journal=[[PNAS]] |date=Jan 15, 2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702958104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/2/454.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[ Environmental regulation]]s in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle.&lt;ref name="pnas_pdf" /&gt; Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-pathways-analysis-informing-development-of-a-carbon-reduction-strategy-for-the-transport-sector.html |title=Claverton-Energy.com |publisher=Claverton-Energy.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Data on the barriers and motivators to more sustainable transport behaviour is available in the UK Department for Transport study "[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ Climate Change and Transport Choices] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530124709/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ |date=2011-05-30 }}" published in December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased [[transport electrification]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

Other environmental impacts of transport systems include [[traffic congestion]] and automobile-oriented [[urban sprawl]], which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's [[air quality]], [[acid rain]], [[smog]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |title=Transportation |author=[[Environment Canada]] |accessdate=30 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713192836/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vincenzo Florio Jr.''' (18 March 1883 – 6 January 1959) was an Italian entrepreneur, heir of the rich [[Florio]] economic dynasty, one of the wealthiest Italian families during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=florio&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/florio/ Flòrio], Treccani Enciclopedie on line (retrieved 10 April 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; An automobile enthusiast, he is best known as the founder of the [[Targa Florio]].


==Early life==
He was the son of the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy|Senator of the Kingdom of Italy]], [[Ignazio Florio Sr.]] and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. He was born in [[Palermo]] and was named after his grandfather [[Vincenzo Florio Sr.]] (1799–1886) who founded the [[Florio]] wine and spice company. He was the younger brother of [[Ignazio Florio Jr.]]. Not inclined to business, he loved traveling and was a frequent visitor of [[Paris]], [[Nice]], [[Montecarlo]] and [[Cannes]]. Luxury boats were one of his passions: in the family they owned five yachts.&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-florio_res-3f57584f-87ed-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Florio, Vincenzo], by Simone Candela - Treccani Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 48 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 he married principessa Annina Alliata di Montereale. After her death to [[cholera]] in 1911, he married [[Lucie Henry]] of [[Épernay]], France, a year later.

==Career==
[[File:Buste of Vincenzo Florio.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Buste of Vincenzo Florio, located between the spectators balconies at the Targa Florio pitcomplex]]
An automobile enthusiast, he initiated the financial basis and the engineering plans for the "Brescia Motor Week" in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]]. He had finished third in the 1904 edition, and generously funding the 1905 race, which was renamed [[Coppa Florio]]. He donated 50,000 lire and a Cup for the winner.  His greatest fame came from creating the [[Targa Florio]] race in [[1906 Targa Florio|1906]], based on discussions with [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]] and [[Henri Desgrange]]. The Targa also claimed to be a worldly event not to be missed. Renowned artists, such as [[Alexandre Charpentier]] and [[Leonardo Bistolfi]], were commissioned to design medals. A magazine was initiated, ''Rapiditas'', which aimed to enhance, with graphic and photographic reproductions of the race, the myth of the car and the typical character of modern life, speed.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

Florio also raced himself. His best result was the win in the [[Targa Rignano]] ([[Padova]] - [[Bovolenta]]) 1903, named after Count Rignano, thus inspiring Florio to pick the surname-based Targa Florio.  His own racing team, however, got [[Felice Nazzaro]] to leave [[Fiat]] and join as driver,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; who had won the 1907 race. In 1913 Vincenzo Florio founded the Automobile Club of Sicily, of which he remained president for a long time.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

==Death==
He died at Épernay. He is buried in the family chapel, in the cemetery of [[Santa Maria di Gesù]].

==Commemoration==
Florio was also a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043815/http://www.comune.palermo.it/Eventi/Palazzo%20Ziino/Secondo_Piano/Florio/florio_e.htm Vincenzo Florio, il gusto della modernità]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Vincenzo Florio – A taste for modernity'' was on display in [[Palermo]] in 2003.

The '''Whitfield family''' was a prominent slave-owning [[List of United States political families|American political family]] of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]], and of the Northern United States having established https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Whitfield_House the Henry Whitfield House in 1639 in the town of Guilford, Connecticut.  Historically, it is Connecticut's oldest house. The house, with its massive stone walls, also served as a fort to protect the community Henry Whitfield, for whom the house was built, was a Puritan minister who had come from England to flee religious persecution The house was remodeled in 1868 and opened to the public in 1899 as the first museum of the State of Connecticut, the Henry Whitfield State Museum. The house was restored in 1902–04 and in the 1930s and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. It was named a State Archeological Preserve in 2006.

In the Southern States, the Whitfields formed the American branch of the British [[Whitfield family]] - having descended from the [[British aristocracy]], particularly the [[Earls of Kilmorey]] and having established colonial residency under Sir. Thomas Whitfield, whom headed East India Trading for the British Empire. In early days of [[Colonial America]], the family [[First Families of Virginia|emigrated to Virginia]] in the seventeenth century, particularly, [[Nansemond County, Virginia]] from [[Lancashire, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Connelley|first= William Elsey|date= 1923|title= History Of Kentucky, Volume 5|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=Nabu Press |page= 914|isbn=978-1273257155 |access-date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hathaway|first= James Robert Bent|date= 1900|title=

The family produced many [[United States]] [[United States House of Representatives|Congressmen]], [[US Senator|Senators]] and [[Governor (United States)|Governors]], as well as businessmen and military generals active from the [[American Revolutionary War]] and past the [[American Civil War]], with significance during the [[antebellum period]].

==Background==
[[File:Gaineswood_in_October_2011_01.JPG|thumb|The [[Gaineswood]] plantation home.]]
[[File:Gaineswood_Ballroom.jpg|thumb|Ballroom at Gaineswood.]]
Born in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], patriarch [[William Whitfield I]] moved to [[Nansemond County, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lHIxq9iDgYQC&amp;pg=PA569&amp;lpg=PA569&amp;dq=william+whitfield+iii+genealogy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4L4bgJvYP&amp;sig=WkNK1zcDNzqLlBKGHNt1t0K5-qY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dxGtVMazKtiBygSNiYLYAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20whitfield%20iii%20genealogy&amp;f=false The North Carolina Historical and Genealogical Register] Volume I&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, Whitfield, along with his wife, were killed by the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora Indians]]. His son, [[William Whitfield II]] purchased [[Seven Springs, North Carolina]] from Buckskin Williams, the father of [[Benjamin Williams]], the [[Governor of North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title= Daughters of the American Revolution|url= |accessdate= |year= |publisher=[[Daughters of the American Revolution|DAR]] |location= |isbn= |page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Revolutionary War]], he served as a [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] of the [[6th Virginia Regiment]], along with his sons, Needham Whitfield and [[William Whitfield III]] who were in the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]] during the revolutionary war. The former was a clerk to Colonel [[Richard Caswell]] and the other a private in the Light Horse [[Cavalry]], taking prisoner General McDonald, who was the Commander of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitfield |first=Emma |authorlink= |title=Whitfield, Bryan, Smith &amp; Related Families |url= |accessdate= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitfield II was a [[Dobbs County, North Carolina|Dobbs County]] member to the 1761 and 1762 [[North Carolina General Assembly]] held in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. In 1779 he was a member of Governor [[Richard Caswell]]'s Council held in New Berne, and a [[Justice of Peace]] for [[Johnston County, North Carolina]]. He was later a [[Colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Whitfield Record, The North Carolina historical and genealogical register.

Along with his son, he was a Director and Trustee for designing and building the town of [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Wanesboro]]. He had 29 children&lt;ref&gt;[http://walkofhonor.com/whitfield_william_army.html Whitfield, William, Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]&lt;/ref&gt; and forty of his descendants served in the [[confederate army]] during the American Civil war.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

This included, [[Nathan Bryan Whitfield]], William III's nephew, who became the Counselor of State for the State of North Carolina and was a State Senator. He was later commissioned to [[Major General]] rank to succeed his father for the militia. His son, Dr. Bryan Watkins Whitfield, was [[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States|pardoned]] by U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]] on September 12, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67161672 Dr Bryan Watkins Whitfield] at [[Find a Grave]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaineswood]], which still stands today, was the most significant remaining examples of [[Greek Revival architecture]] in Alabama.&lt;ref name="gamble"&gt;Gamble, Robert ''Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930'', page 76.

Whitfield is known to have designed most of the house from pattern books by [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]], [[Minard Lafever]], [[Nicholas Revett]] and others.&lt;ref name="marengo"/&gt;  Much of the work on the house was executed by highly skilled [[artisan]] slaves.&lt;ref name="Gaineswood"/&gt; Whitfield moved from [[North Carolina]] to Marengo County, Alabama in 1834.  In 1842 Whitfield bought the {{convert|480|acre|km2|adj=on}} property from [[George Strother Gaines]], younger brother of [[Edmund P. Gaines]].

[[File:Gaineswood_Library.jpg|thumb|The library inside the [[Gaineswood]] residence.]]
Much of the work on the house was executed by highly skilled [[artisan]] slaves.&lt;ref name="Gaineswood"/&gt; The grounds had been the site of a notable historic event while owned by George Gaines.  When Gaines was serving as the US [[Indian Agent]], he is said to have met with the famous [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Pushmataha]], of the [[Choctaw]] Nation, under an old [[post oak]] tree on what would become the Gaineswood estate.  They were negotiating the terms of the treaty that would lead to the Choctaw [[Indian removal|removal]] to [[Indian Territory]].  The tree became known as the Pushmataha Oak.&lt;ref name="hammond"&gt;Hammond, Ralph ''Ante-bellum Mansions of Alabama'', pages 114-120.  New York: Architectural Book Publishers, 1951. {{ISBN|0-517-02075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitfield first named the estate Marlmont in 1843; he renamed it Gaineswood in 1856 in honor of Gaines.&lt;ref name="marengo"&gt;Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: ''The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama'', page 18. Clanton, Alabama: Heritage Publishing Consultants, 2000. {{ISBN|1-891647-58-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whitfield family tradition maintained that Gaines' original log house was the nucleus around which Whitfield had the mansion built, and that it was located at the present site of the south entrance hall and office.&lt;ref name="Gaineswood"&gt;"{{cite web|title=Gaineswood|work="Alabama Historical Commission"|url=http://www.preserveala.org/gaineswood.aspx?sm=g_i|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gen. Whitfield sold the house to his son, Dr. Bryan Watkins Whitfield, in 1861. The second generation of Whitfields maintained Gaineswood as a residence. Mary Foscue Whitfield inherited the nearby [[Foscue-Whitfield House]] in 1861 upon her father's death and used that as a residence as well.&lt;ref name="marengo"/&gt; For later descendants, post Civil War, the lands and plantations were sold.

In November 2014, it was reported that The Business Council along with JR Simplot Co, are examining the possibility of re-opening the Fremont County iron mine. The mine was shuttered in 1983 and was one of the highest employers in the area. The study will examine the cost of reviving the mine along with the benefits of an estimated 150 million to 200 million tons of iron remaining in the old mine.&lt;ref&gt;http://trib.com/business/energy/wyoming-business-council-jr-simplot-co-study-reopening-fremont-county/article_026fea42-7af5-586c-a48b-d323ec4c97a9.html&lt;/ref&gt;
