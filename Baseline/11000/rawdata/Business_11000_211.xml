'''Per Adolf Lindskog''' (1751–1836) was a notable businessman and shipbuilder in [[Jakobstad]] at the turn of the 19th century. He was married to ''Anna Catharina Malm'', the daughter of the prominent merchant and shipbuilder ''Niclas Malm''. When his [[father-in-law]] Niclas Malm died in 1785, Adolf Lindskog took over the management of the city's [[Chewing tobacco|twist tobacco]] factory.

Trade started to develop rapidly in [[Jakobstad]] as of 1765, when the cities along the Finnish shore of the Gulf of Botnia were granted privileges by the Swedish crown to trade directly with foreign countries, and Jakobstad became one of the wealthiest cities per capita in [[Finland]]. This also meant brisk business for Lindskog, and he was periodically the city's wealthiest man, competing with his [[brother-in-law]] [[Pehr Malm]] for this title.

In 1797 Adolf Lindskog had built the city's first house built of stone at the market square (it is today Jakobstad's oldest house). The same year, he founded a shipyard, with the intention to concentrate all ship building in Jakobstad to the same location.  This shipyard was built on ''Calholmen'', and was named ''Calholmens skeppsvarv'' (the shipyard of Calholmen). This area is today called ''Varvet''. During a period of 75 years, around 150 ships were built at this shipyard.

Lembergs was born in [[Jēkabpils]], Latvia. He studied [[economics]] in Latvian State University (now known as the [[University of Latvia]]), graduating in 1977. He then worked in various positions in the [[Communist party of Latvia]], becoming mayor of Ventspils in 1988. He stayed in this position after Latvia became independent and has been re-elected five times. Lembergs was the leader of the local political party, ''[[Latvijai un Ventspilij]]'' ("For Latvia and Ventspils") which he founded in 1994. ''Latvijai un Ventspilij'' has completely dominated the city politics since it was founded. Before the 2006 parliamentary election, Lembergs' party ''Latvijai and Ventspilij'' entered into an alliance with the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] and the Union of Greens and Farmers named Lembergs as its candidate for the Prime Minister of Latvia. He remains its leading figure and chief financial supporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nations in Transit 2007: Democratization from Central Europe to Eurasia |last=Goehring |first=Jeannette |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=London |isbn=978-0-932088-26-0 |pages=404 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drjJRxs2HRMC |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the three "oligarchs" against which [[Zatlers' Reform Party]] had pledged to act if it achieves office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-18/latvian-parties-agree-on-budget-euro-as-coalition-talks-begin.html Eglitis, Aaron.

'''Antonín Petrof''' (August 15, 1839 – September 9, 1915) was a Czech piano maker.&lt;ref&gt;Palmieri, R., ''The Piano: An Encyclopedia''
([[Oxfordshire]]: [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
In 1857, when Petrof was 18 years old, he was visited by his maternal uncle Jan Heitzmann at his family's [[Hradec Králové]] home. Heitzmann and his partner Hölzl were already known piano manufacturers in [[Vienna]]. Petrof learned the trade in Vienna and in 1864 returned to Bohemia, where he built his first piano. In 1865 he transformed his father's cabinetry enterprise in the old town square, behind the [[Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, Hradec Králové|Cathedral of the Holy Spirit]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Marchal, J., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/recession/4930704/Luxury-piano-maker-Petrof-turns-to-furniture-in-global-economic-crisis.html "Luxury piano maker Petrof turns to furniture in global economic crisis"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Mar 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; into a piano-making workshop.

In 1866, a few months before the enveloping [[Battle of Königgrätz]], Petrof registered his company, A. Petrof. After a brief compulsory interruption, during which the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] defeated the [[Austrian Empire]], production resumed. In 1874 his company relocated to new premises on the outskirts of Hradec Králové.

The company grew, and in 1880 an auxiliary factory opened in Temesvár, Austria-Hungary (today [[Timișoara]], [[Romania]]). A year later, in 1881, Petrof premiered his own keyboard and mechanical design. In 1883, production of the piano began.

In 1894–95 the first instruments were exported, and A. Petrof was quickly able to establish itself. A warehouse and comptoir were opened in Vienna. Clients included nobility and the imperial court. By the early 20th century, A. Petrof was the largest piano manufacturer in the [[Austria-Hungary|monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Veselinovic, M., [https://www.economist.com/news/business/21591243-chopins-piano-maker-gives-up-others-are-fighting-chinese-rivals-major-challenges-minor "Piano-makers: Major challenges, minor successes"], ''[[The Economist]]'', Dec 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Petrof's 1915 death, the company was supplying living rooms, concert halls and royal families across Europe. Its 30,000th piano had been delivered to [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], two weeks before his [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauerova, L. M., [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-19/czech-piano-maker-petrof-focuses-on-china-sales-to-survive "Czech Piano Maker Petrof Focuses on China Sales to Survive"], [[Bloomberg_L.P.#Bloomberg_News|Bloomberg]], Sep 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the company began making luxury furniture, using the same skills and technology used to build grand pianos, in an effort to branch out and dodge ingravescent effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]]. Since that time, production has settled at 50% pianos, 50% furniture. Such diversification is characteristic of a survival strategy that has seen Petrof through two world wars and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi invasion]], as well as 40 years of the [[Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|communist regime]], during which, following forced nationalisation in 1948, it was incorporated into the state concern "Piano and Organ Factory".&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [https://books.google.com/books?id=FtwJAQAAMAAJ ''Czech Music''] (Prague: Czech Music Foundation, 2006), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under communist rule, though factory installations were expanded and production figures increased, instrument quality concomitantly declined. The current company president, Zuzana Ceralová Petrofová, was among tens of thousands of peaceful protesters who successfully demanded an end to the communist regime in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesverband Klavier e.V. , [https://www.pianos.de/en/the_instrument/index.php?id=27 "History: 1915"], 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; "During the [[Great Depression|1930s crisis]] Petrof manufactured [[Railroad tie|wooden railway sleepers]]," says Ms. Ceralová Petrofová, "and during [[World War II]] it focused on [[grenade]] boxes."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

'''''Balfour v Balfour''''' [1919] 2 KB 571 is a leading [[English contract law]] case. It held that there is a [[rebuttable presumption]] against an intention to create a legally enforceable agreement when the agreement is domestic in nature.

==Facts==
Mr Balfour was a civil engineer, and worked for the Government as the Director of [[Irrigation]] in [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). Mrs Balfour was living with him. In 1915, they both came back to England during Mr Balfour's leave. But Mrs Balfour had developed [[Rheumatism|rheumatic]] [[arthritis]]. Her doctor advised her to stay in England, because the Ceylon climate would be detrimental to her health. Mr Balfour's boat was about to set sail, and he orally promised her £30 a month until she came back to Ceylon. They drifted apart, and Mr Balfour wrote saying it was better that they remain apart. In March 1918, Mrs Balfour sued him to keep up with the monthly £30 payments. In July she got a [[decree nisi]] and in December she obtained an order for [[alimony]].

At first instance, [[Charles Sargant|Sargant J]] held that Mr Balfour was under an obligation to support his wife.

==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal unanimously held that there was no enforceable agreement, although the depth of their reasoning differed. [[Warrington LJ]] delivered his opinion first, the core part being this passage.&lt;ref&gt;[1919] 2 KB 571,574-575&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The matter really reduces itself to an absurdity when one considers it, because if we were to hold that there was a contract in this case we should have to hold that with regard to all the more or less trivial concerns of life where a wife, at the request of her husband, makes a promise to him, that is a promise which can be enforced in law. All I can say is that there is no such contract here. These two people never intended to make a bargain which could be enforced in law. The husband expressed his intention to make this payment, and he promised to make it, and was bound in honour to continue it so long as he was in a position to do so. The wife on the other hand, so far as I can see, made no bargain at all. That is in my opinion sufficient to dispose of the case.}}

Then [[Duke LJ]] gave his. He placed weight on the fact that the parties had not yet been divorced, and that the promise had been made still whilst as husband and wife.

{{cquote|[[Image:1stLordMerrivale.jpg|thumb|right|[[Duke LJ]], previously a Conservative party politician, became the president of the divorce division from 1919 to 1933.]]
In the Court below the plaintiff conceded that down to the time of her suing in the Divorce Division there was no separation, and that the period of absence was a period of absence as between husband and wife living in amity. An agreement for separation when it is established does involve mutual considerations.

That was why in ''[[Eastland v Burchell]]'' 3 QBD 432, the agreement for separation was found by the learned judge to have been of decisive consequence. But in this case there was no separation agreement at all. The parties were husband and wife, and subject to all the conditions, in point of law, involved in that relationship. It is impossible to say that where the relationship of husband and wife exists, and promises are exchanged, they must be deemed to be promises of a contractual nature. In order to establish a contract there ought to be something more than mere mutual promises having regard to the domestic relations of the parties. It is required that the obligations arising out of that relationship shall be displaced before either of the parties can found a contract upon such promises. The formula which was stated in this case to support the claim of the lady was this: In consideration that you will agree to give me 30l. a month I will agree to forego my right to pledge your credit. In the judgment of the majority of the Court of Common Pleas in ''[[Jolly v Rees]]'' (1864) 15 C. B. (N. S.) 628, which was affirmed in the decision of ''[[Debenham v Mellon]]'' (1880) 6 App. Cas. 24 Erle C.J. states this proposition 5 : “But taking the law to be, that the power of the wife to charge her husband is in the capacity of his agent, it is a solecism in reasoning to say that she derives her authority from his will, and at the same time to say that the relation of wife creates the authority against his will, by a presumptio juris et de jure from marriage.” What is said on the part of the wife in this case is that her arrangement with her husband that she should assent to that which was in his discretion to do or not to do was the consideration moving from her to her husband. The giving up of that which was not a right was not a consideration. The proposition that the mutual promises made in the ordinary domestic relationship of husband and wife of necessity give cause for action on a contract seems to me to go to the very root of the relationship, and to be a possible fruitful source of dissension and quarrelling. I cannot see that any benefit would result from it to either of the parties, but on the other hand it would lead to unlimited litigation in a relationship which should be obviously as far as possible protected from possibilities of that kind. I think, therefore, that in point of principle there is no foundation for the claim which is made here, and I am satisfied that there was no consideration *578 moving from the wife to the husband or promise by the husband to the wife which was sufficient to sustain this action founded on contract. I think, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed.}}

[[Lord Justice Atkin]]&lt;ref&gt;[1919] 2 KB 571, 579-580&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach, emphasising that there was no "intention to effect legal relations". That was so because it was a domestic agreement between husband and wife, and it meant the onus of proof was on the plaintiff, Mrs Balfour. She did not rebut the presumption.

{{cquote|&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Lord Atkin of Aberdovey.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Atkin, Baron Atkin]] became well known for his original judgments, including ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' and ''[[Liversidge v Anderson]]'']] --&gt;
The defence to this action on the alleged contract is that the defendant, the husband, entered into no contract with his wife, and for the determination of that it is necessary to remember that there are agreements between parties which do not result in contracts within the meaning of that term in our law. The ordinary example is where two parties agree to take a [[walk]] together, or where there is an offer and an acceptance of [[hospitality]]. Nobody would suggest in ordinary circumstances that those agreements result in what we know as a contract, and one of the most usual forms of agreement which does not constitute a contract appears to me to be the arrangements which are made between husband and wife. It is quite common, and it is the natural and inevitable result of the relationship of husband and wife, that the two spouses should make arrangements between themselves - agreements such as are in dispute in this action - agreements for allowances, by which the husband agrees that he will pay to his wife a certain sum of money, per week, or per month, or per year, to cover either her own expenses or the necessary expenses of the household and of the [[children]] of the marriage, and in which the wife promises either expressly or impliedly to apply the allowance for the purpose for which it is given. To my mind those agreements, or many of them, do not result in contracts at all, and they do not result in contracts even though there may be what as between other parties would constitute consideration for the agreement. The [[Consideration in English law|consideration]], as we know, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other. That is a well-known definition, and it constantly happens, I think, that such arrangements made between husband and wife are arrangements in which there are mutual promises, or in which there is consideration in form within the definition that I have mentioned. Nevertheless they are not contracts, and they are not contracts because the parties did not intend that they should be attended by legal consequences. To my mind it would be of the worst possible example to hold that agreements such as this resulted in legal obligations which could be enforced in the Courts. It would mean this, that when the husband makes his wife a promise to give her an allowance of 30s. or 2l. a week, whatever he can afford to give her, for the maintenance of the household and children, and she promises so to apply it, not only could she sue him for his failure in any week to supply the allowance, but he could sue her for non-performance of the obligation, express or implied, which she had undertaken upon her part. All I can say is that the small Courts of this country would have to be multiplied one hundredfold if these arrangements were held to result in legal obligations. They are not sued upon, not because the parties are reluctant to enforce their legal rights when the agreement is broken, but because the parties, in the inception of the arrangement, never intended that they should be sued upon. Agreements such as these are outside the realm of contracts altogether. The common law does not regulate the form of agreements between spouses. Their promises are not sealed with seals and sealing [[wax]]. The consideration that really obtains for them is that natural love and affection which counts for so little in these cold Courts. The terms may be repudiated, varied or renewed as performance proceeds or as disagreements develop, and the principles of the common law as to exoneration and discharge and accord and satisfaction are such as find no place in the [[Home|domestic]] code. The parties themselves are advocates, judges, Courts, sheriff's officer and reporter. In respect of these promises each house is a domain into which the King's writ does not seek to run, and to which his officers do not seek to be admitted. The only question in this case is whether or not this promise was of such a class or not. For the reasons given by my brethren it appears to me to be plainly established that the promise here was not intended by either party to be attended by legal consequences. I think the [[Legal burden of proof|onus]] was upon the plaintiff, and the plaintiff has not established any contract. The parties were living together, the wife intending to return. The suggestion is that the husband bound himself to pay 30l. a month under all circumstances, and she bound herself to be satisfied with that sum under all circumstances, and, although she was in ill-health and alone in this country, that out of that sum she undertook to defray the whole of the medical expenses that might fall upon her, whatever might be the development of her illness, and in whatever expenses it might involve her. To my mind neither party contemplated such a result. I think that the [[parol evidence]] upon which the case turns does not establish a contract. I think that the letters do not evidence such a contract, or amplify the oral evidence which was given by the wife, which is not in dispute. For these reasons I think the judgment of the Court below was wrong and that this appeal should be allowed.}}

==Significance==
The case is often cited in conjunction with ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' [1970] 2 All ER 760; [1970] 1 WLR 1211.  Here the court [[distinguish]]ed the case from ''Balfour v Balfour'' on the fact that Mr and Mrs Merritt, although still married, were estranged at the time the agreement was made and therefore any agreement between them was made with the intention to create legal relations.  Both cases are often quoted examples of the principle of [[precedent]].

"Jokes are sometimes taken seriously...  if such is the case, and thereby the person deceived is led to give valuable services in the full belief and expectation that the joker is in earnest, the law will also take the joker at his word, and give him good reason to smile."

'''Banco di Chiavari e della Riviera Ligure''' (BCRL) was an Italian regional bank based in [[Chiavari]], Liguria. it was acquired and absorbed into [[Banca Popolare di Lodi]] in 2003. Currently it is a division and a brand of [[Banco Popolare]].

==History==
The bank was found in 1870 as '''Banco di Sconto del Circondario di Chiavari'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bancopopolare.it/banco-di-chiavari-e-della-riviera-ligure/la-storia/|title=La Storia |access-date=10 February 2016|publisher=Banco di Chiavari e della Riviera Ligure|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 it was acquired by  [[Banca Commerciale Italiana]] (BCI). In 1999 BCRL became part of [[Banca Intesa]] Group. That year Intesa acquired 70% shares of BCI, which owned 69.62% shares of BCRL. In 2001 Intesa held all the shares previously owned by BCI. On 21 January 2003 BCRL was sold to [[Banca Popolare di Lodi|Bipielle]] Group. Bipielle acquired all the bank activity of the company and renaming the company into [[Reti Bancarie]], which ''de facto'' making the company publicly float the retail banking subsidiaries of the group in [[Borsa Italiana]].

In 2008 BPL relaunched the brand as the name of the branches in Liguria region. After BPL was absorbed into the parent company, BCRL was a department of bank division BPL instead.

'''Birchwood Park''' is a [[business park]] in Birchwood near [[Warrington]], United Kingdom.

During World War II it was the site of [[ROF Risley|Risley Royal Ordnance Factory]]. It was then used by the [[Admiralty]] as a storage depot until 1961, except for the north west section which was taken over by [[UKAEA]] in 1956.

The '''capacity''' of [[natural person|natural]]  and [[juridical person|juridical]] persons ([[legal person]]s) in general, determines whether they may make binding amendments to their [[rights]], [[duty|duties]] and [[obligation]]s, such as getting [[marriage|married]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions|merging]], entering into [[contract]]s, making [[gift (law)|gifts]], or writing a valid [[will (law)|will]]. Capacity is an aspect of [[status (law)|status]] and both are defined by a person's ''personal law'':
*for natural persons, the law of [[domicile (law)|domicile]] or ''[[lex domicilii]]'' in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, and either the law of [[nationality]] or ''[[lex patriae]]'', or of [[habitual residence]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] states;
*for juridical persons, the law of the place of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], the ''[[lex incorporationis]]'' for [[company (law)|companies]] while other forms of business entity derive their capacity either from the law of the place in which they were formed or the laws of the states in which they establish a presence for trading purposes depending on the nature of the entity and the transactions entered into.
When the [[law]] limits or bars a person from engaging in specified activities, any [[Contract|agreements]] or [[contract]]s to do so are either [[Voidable contract|voidable]] or [[Void contract|void]] for '''incapacity'''.  Sometimes such legal incapacity is referred to as ''incompetence''.  For comparison, see [[Competence (law)]].

==Discussion==
As an aspect of the [[social contract]] between a state and its [[citizen]]s, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In [[public policy (law)|public policy]] terms, this is the policy of ''[[parens patriae]]''. Similarly, the state has a direct social and economic interest in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of [[consanguinity]]), she cannot [[evasion (law)|evade]] that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.

===Natural persons===
{{see also|Testamentary capacity}}
Standardized classes of person have had their freedom restricted. These limitations are exceptions to the general policy of [[freedom of contract]] and the detailed [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] that a person of ordinary capacity might enjoy. Hence, for example, freedom of movement may be modified, the [[right to vote]] may be withdrawn, etc. As societies have developed more equal treatment based on gender, race and ethnicity, many of the older incapacities have been removed. For example, [[English law]] used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, which removed the wife's domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).

====Minor (law)====
{{main article|Minor (law)}}

The definition of an ''infant'' or ''minor'' varies, each state reflecting local [[culture]] and [[prejudice]]s in defining the [[age of majority]], [[marriageable age]], [[voting age]], etc. In many [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, legal [[contract]]s, in which (at least) one of the contracting parties is a minor, are voidable by the minor.  For a minor to undergo [[medical procedure]], [[consent]] is determined by the minor's parent(s) or [[legal guardian]](s).  The right to vote in the United States is currently set at 18 years, while the right to buy and consume [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often set at 21 years by U.S. [[state law]].  Some laws, such as marriage laws, may differentiate between the sexes and allow women to marry younger. There are instances in which a person may be able to gain capacity earlier than the prescribed time through a process of [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]]. Conversely, many states allow the inexperience of childhood to be an excusing condition to criminal liability and set the [[age of criminal responsibility]] to match the local experience of emerging behavioral problems (see ''[[doli incapax]]''). For sexual crimes, the [[age of consent]] determines the potential liability of [[adult]] accused.

As an example of liability in contract, the law in most of Canada provides that an infant is not bound by the contracts he or she enters into except for the purchase of necessaries and for beneficial contracts of service. Infants must pay fair price only for necessary goods and services. However, the [[British Columbia]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040617060433/http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm Infants Act]'' (RSBC 1996 c.223) declares all contracts, including necessities and beneficial contracts of service, are unenforceable against an infant. Only student loans and other contracts made specifically enforceable by statute will be binding on infants in that province.

In contracts between an adult and an infant, adults are bound but infants may escape contracts at their option (i.e. the contract is voidable). Infants may ratify a contract on reaching age of majority. In the case of executed contracts, when the infant has obtained some benefit under the contract, he/she cannot avoid obligations unless what was obtained was of no value. Upon repudiation of a contract, either party can apply to the court. The court may order restitution, damages, or discharge the contract. All contracts involving the transfer of real estate are considered valid until ruled otherwise.

====Minors and Contractual Capacity====
A [[Minor (law)|minor]] (typically under 18) can disaffirm a contract made, no matter the case. However, the entire contract must be disaffirmed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the minor may be required to return any of the goods still in his possession. Also, [[barter]] transactions such as purchasing a [[retail]] item in exchange for a cash payment are generally recognized through a [[legal fiction]] not to be contracts due to the absence of promises of future action.  A minor may not disavow such a trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. &lt;u&gt;[http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm A Consent Theory of Contracts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925033415/http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/u&gt; Columbia Law Review (March, 1986) pp. 299, fn 123&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Disaffirmance''' - it  must be timely. For example, a contract that goes beyond two years of reaching the age of majority would be considered ratified. Minors are still allowed to disaffirm, even if their age is misrepresented. They will not face tort violations. Some states don't allow disaffirmance if the consideration cannot be returned.
*'''Obligations''' - most states hold that a minor only must return the goods (consideration) if the goods are still in the minor’s possession. Many states are requiring that the minor restore the adult (other party) to the state they were in before the contract was made. Minors are beginning to be held responsible for damages, wear, tear, etc. of the good in question upon return. A suit for tort is considered by some states to be an enforcement of the contract and is not allowed.
*'''Liability''' - for necessities, (1) the item contracted for must be necessary for minor’s existence, (2) the value must be up to that of the current standard of living or financial/social status (not excessive in value), (3) the minor must not be under the care of a parent/guardian who is required to supply the item. A minor could be held liable for a contract for the purchase of luxury items (those that are not in the financial/social/standard of living range).
*'''Ratification''' - accepting and giving legal force to an obligation. Express ratification (for a minor) is expressly stating, orally or in writing that he/she intends to be bound by the contract. Implied ratification is when the conduct of the minor is inconsistent with that of disaffirmance or when minor fails to disaffirm an executed contract within a reasonable period.
Generally, the courts base their determination on whether the minor, after reaching the age of majority, has had ample opportunity to consider the nature of the contractual obligations he or she entered into as a minor and the extent to which the adult party to the contract has performed.&lt;ref&gt;Jentz, Gaylord A. and Roger LeRoy Miller &lt;u&gt;Business Law Today: The Essentials&lt;/u&gt; South-Western College/West, Ohio, 2003 pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;
As one court put it, "the purpose of the infancy doctrine is to protect 'minors from foolishly squandering their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Hauer v. Union State Bank of Wautoma'', 192 Wis. 2d 576, 593 (1995), quoting ''Halbman v. Lemke'', 99 Wis. 2d 241, 245 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insanity, mental illness, or mental/medical condition====
{{See also|Insanity|mental disorder}}
Individuals may have an inherent physical condition which prevents them from achieving the normal levels of performance expected from persons of comparable age, or their inability to match current levels of performance may be caused by contracting an illness. Whatever the cause, if the resulting condition is such that individuals cannot care for themselves, or may act in ways that are against their interests, those persons are vulnerable through dependency and require the protection of the state against the risks of abuse or exploitation. Hence, any agreements that were made are voidable, and a court may declare that person a ward of the state and grant [[power of attorney]] to an appointed [[legal guardian]].

In England and Wales, this is a specific function of the [[Court of protection|Court of Protection]], and all matters concerning persons who have lost, or expect soon to lose, mental capacity are regulated under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. This makes provision for [[Lasting power of attorney|lasting powers of attorney]] under which decisions about the health, welfare and financial assets of a person who has lost capacity may be dealt with in that person's interests.

In Ireland the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act addresses the capacity of people with intellectual disabilities. The general principles are set out in section 8 of the Act.

This sort of problem sometimes arises when people suffer some form of medical problem such as unconsciousness, [[coma]], extensive [[paralysis]], or delirious states, from accidents or illnesses such as [[stroke]]s, or often when older people become afflicted with some form of medical/mental [[disability]] such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Lewy body]] disease, or similar dementia.  Such persons are often unable to consent to medical treatment and otherwise handle their financial and other personal matters.  If the afflicted person has prepared documents beforehand about what to do in such cases, often in a revocable living [[Trust law|trust]] or related documents, then the named legal guardian may be able to take over their financial and other affairs.  If the afflicted person owns his/her property jointly with a spouse or other able person, the able person may be able to take over many of the routine financial affairs.  Otherwise, it is often necessary to petition a court, such as a [[probate court]], that the afflicted person lacks legal capacity and allow a legal guardian to take over their financial and personal affairs.  Procedures and court review have been established, dependent on the area of jurisdiction, to prevent exploitation of the incapacitated person by the guardian.  The guardian periodically provides a financial accounting for court review.

In the [[Criminal Law]], the traditional common law [[M'Naghten Rules]] [[excuse]]d all persons from liability if they did not understand what they were doing or, if they did, that they did not know it was wrong. The consequences of this excuse were that those accused were detained indefinitely or until the medical authorities certified that it was safe to release them back into the community. This consequence was felt to be too draconian and so statutes have introduced new defenses that will limit or reduce the liability of those accused of committing offenses if they were suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time (see the [[insanity defense|insanity]] and [[mental disorder defense|mental disorder]] defenses).

====Drunkenness or drug abuse====
Although individuals may have consumed a sufficient quantity of intoxicant or drug to reduce or eliminate their ability to understand exactly what they are doing, such conditions are self-induced and so the law does not generally allow any defense or excuse to be raised to any actions taken while incapacitated. The most generous states do permit individuals to repudiate agreements as soon as sober, but the conditions to exercising this right are strict.

====Bankruptcy====
{{See also|Bankruptcy}}
If individuals find themselves in a situation where they can no longer pay their debts, they lose their status as credit-worthy and become bankrupt. States differ on the means whereby their outstanding liabilities can be treated as discharged and on the precise extent of the limits that are placed on their capacities during this time but, after discharge, they are returned to full capacity. In the United States, some [[U.S. state|states]] have spendthrift laws under which an irresponsible spender may be deemed to lack capacity to enter into contracts (in Europe, these are termed prodigality laws) and both sets of laws may be denied extraterritorial effect under public policy as imposing a potentially penal status on the individuals affected.

====Enemy aliens and/or terrorists====
During times of war or civil strife, a state will limit the ability of its citizens to offer help or assistance in any form to those who are acting against the interests of the state. Hence, all commercial and other contracts with the "enemy", including terrorists, would be considered void or suspended until a cessation of hostilities is agreed.

===Business entities===
*[[Corporations]]
The extent of an artificial person's capacity depends on the law of the place of incorporation and the enabling provisions included in the [[constitutional documents|constitutive documents]] of incorporation. The general rule is that anything not included in the corporation's capacity, whether expressly or by implication, is ''[[ultra vires]]'', i.e. "beyond the power" of the corporation, and so may be unenforceable by the corporation, but the rights and interests of innocent third parties dealing with the corporations are usually protected.
*General and limited partnerships
There is a clear division between the approach of states to the definition of partnerships. One group of states treats [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership|limited]] partnerships as aggregate. In terms of capacity, this means that they are no more than the sum of the natural persons who conduct the business. The other group of states allows partnerships to have a separate legal personality which changes the capacity of the "firm" and those who conduct its business and makes such partnerships more like corporations.
*Unions
In some states, [[trade union]]s have limited capacity unless any contract made relates to union activities.
*[[Insolvency]]
When a business entity becomes insolvent, an [[Administrator (law)|administrator]], receiver, or other similar legal functionary may be appointed to determine whether the entity shall continue to trade or be sold so that the creditors may receive all or a proportion of the money owing to them. During this time, the capacity of the entity is limited so that its liabilities are not increased unreasonably and to the detriment of the existing creditors.

'''Carlos Alberto Bulgheroni''' (March 9, 1945 – September 3, 2016) was an Argentine businessman prominent in the nation's [[Energy in Argentina|energy sector]], and the country's richest man at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Carlos Bulgheroni was born in [[Rufino, Santa Fe|Rufino]], [[Santa Fe Province]], to a [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]] mother and an [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] father.&lt;ref name=blue&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluechipmag.com/bc/content_detail.php?content=64 |title=Carlos Bulgheroni - the intrepid entrepreneur |work=Blue Chip |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110033932/http://www.bluechipmag.com/bc/content_detail.php?content=64 |archivedate=2010-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and earned a ''[[juris doctor]]'' in 1970. Bulgheroni developed [[lymphoma]] at age 24, but recovered.&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2010/03/15/noticia_0018.html|title=Petróleo y millones: la historia de los Bulgheroni|work=Perfil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He joined his father Alejandro in [[Bridas Corporation]], founded by the Bulgheroni family in 1948 and by the 1970s one of the largest private firms in the Argentine energy sector. The senior Bulgheroni died in 1985 and left a controlling stake in the firm to Carlos and his elder brother, Alejandro. Carlos Bulgheroni became the firm's chief political point man, establishing good working relationships with the various administrations in power since 1983.&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt; He was named president and chairman in 1993; president of the [[British Petroleum|BP]]-controlled PanAmerican Energy in 1997; of [[Allis-Chalmers]]'s energy unit in 2006; and of EDIC, a company specializing in the exploration and production of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in the [[North Africa]]n, [[Russia]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, and [[Middle East|Middle]] and [[Far East]]ern markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=28799704&amp;ric=ALY&amp;previousCapId=1066957&amp;previousTitle=Allis-Chalmers%20Energy%2C%20Inc. ''BusinessWeek'': Carlos Alberto Bulgheroni]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgheroni obtained, in 1992, some of the first gas exploration concessions granted in [[Turkmenistan]] to a foreign energy company.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt; He was further involved during 1997 in negotiations between Bridas and the ruling [[Taliban]] faction in [[Afghanistan]] to build the [[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline|Trans-Afghanistan Gas Pipeline]] from Turkmenistan to [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/11/08/elpais/p-02003.htm ''Clarín'' (11/8/2005) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations were in competition with those undertaken by [[Unocal]],&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/37021.stm Taleban in Texas for talks on gas pipeline (12/4/1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; and although an agreement with Unocal-led corporation [[CentGas]] was reached, the deal was forfeited in January 1998 in favor of one with Bridas.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/44521.stm BBC: Taleban says it's ready to sign Turkmen pipeline deal (1/4/1998)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Instability in Afghanistan delayed construction of the pipeline, however, and following the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|United States Invasion of Afghanistan]] in October 2001, the Bridas contract was rescinded in favor of the former one with Unocal. In 2006, Bulgheroni indicated interest in Bridas' involvement with the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline project, which continued to be hampered by the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|ongoing chaos]] in the Central Asian nation.&lt;ref name=envir&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2006/2006-04-17-05.asp ''Environment News Service'': Afghanistan's New Pipeline Deal May Be Just Another Pipe Dream (4/17/2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgheroni is a co-founder of the [[Teatro Colón|Colón Theatre]] Foundation (1978) and of the [[Policia Federal Argentina|Federal District Police]] Foundation (1989); the latter helps maintain the Churruca Police Officers Hospital, in [[Buenos Aires]]. He is also a member of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research (FIEL), the [[Peres Center for Peace]], the Argentine Russian Business Council, and the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS). At CSIS, in addition to acting as a trustee, he also serves as an international councillor and a senior adviser to the [[Space Exploration Initiative]].&lt;ref name=csis&gt;[http://csis.org/expert/carlos-bulgheroni CSIS:Carlos Bulgheroni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225062528/http://csis.org/expert/carlos-bulgheroni |date=2009-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He previously served as co-chairman of the International Committee at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and currently serves as a member there. He is the founder and current partner of the U.S. &amp; Argentine Caucus. He was named Grand Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]. Previously, Bulgheroni served as president of the Argentine Business Council, as a member of the Business Advisory Board of the [[World Trade Organization]] in [[Geneva]], as president and representative for [[Mercosur]] from 1990 to 2002 for the Mercosur European Business Forum, and as a member of the Executive Board of the [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=csis/&gt; The Bulgheroni brothers sold a 50% stake in Bridas to Chinese oil giant [[CNOOC]] in 2010 for US$3.1 billion.&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt; They retained a 20% stake in PanAmerican Energy (whose operations in Argentina had grown to become the nation's second-largest) through Bridas.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Death==
Bulgheroni died in Washington DC, on 3 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2016/09/03/murio-el-empresario-carlos-bulgheroni/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">'''Court auction''' is an auction which takes place at a public location designated by the court.

If a property owner fails to pay the mortgage, the mortgage holder can [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on that property. If the owner is unable to make sufficient payments, the property can be sold at auction. The time and place of the auction is published in official records.

In case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property, this can finish the trouble for the debitor by paying all the credits.

== Germany ==

In [[Germany]] the court may suspend the auction for 6 months on the debtor's justified request. Justification may be hardship, e.g. if debtor has a physical disability and cannot find adequate housing. The creditor can object up to twice if the result of the auction is not sufficient to fulfil the claim. The bidder must deposit security in the amount of 10%. The highest bidder becomes the owner of the real property. If the claim is greater than the market value of the real property, debts are handled in an [[insolvency]] proceeding.

== Spain ==

Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees.

== United States ==

Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner. In 2009 there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country’s acute economic downturn. The rules for court auction differ in the states.

He had trained at [[Star City, Moscow]] in Russia to fly with two members of [[Expedition 14]] on board [[Soyuz TMA-9]], which was launched on September 18, 2006.

However, on August 21, 2006, a Russian Federal Space Agency spokesman announced that Enomoto was "deemed not ready to fly for exclusively medical reasons", although he hinted that Enomoto might recover and join a later mission. His replacement on this particular flight was [[Iranian-American]] businesswoman [[Anousheh Ansari]]. Enomoto was involved in a [[lawsuit]] against Virginia-based [[Space Adventures]] in which he hoped to reclaim the $21 million he paid the company over a two-year span.&lt;ref name="Klotz"&gt;{{cite web |first=Irene |last=Klotz |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080925/sc_nm/us_space_touristscience |title=Grounded space tourist wants $21 million refund |date=2008-11-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5b7JP4I6O?url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080925/sc_nm/us_space_touristscience |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the lawsuit, it was revealed that the "medical reason" was chronic [[kidney stones]].&lt;ref name="BARAKAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081121/ap_on_re_us/space_tourism_lawsuit |title=Would-be Japanese space tourist wants $21M back |first=Matthew |last=Barakat |date=2008-09-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5dF129PAb?url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081121/ap_on_re_us/space_tourism_lawsuit |archivedate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Space Adventures claims it advised Enomoto to treat the kidney stones aggressively and when he did not, they had to disqualify him from spaceflight. Enomoto claims the real reason for his disqualification was his refusal to provide additional funds to Space Adventures.&lt;ref name="BARAKAT" /&gt;

Enomoto would have been the first ''self-funded'' [[space tourist]] from Japan and Asia (journalist [[Toyohiro Akiyama]] flew on [[Soyuz TM-11]] in 1990, and could be regarded as the first space business traveller). Enomoto's flight would have taken him to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) after lifting off from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan, the world's oldest [[spaceport]].

Enomoto made international news when it was revealed that he intended to go into space wearing a [[cosplay|costume]] akin to that of [[Char Aznable]], a character from the [[anime]] series ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''.&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kravets |first=David |title=Wannabe Space Tourist Wants $21 Million Back Over Scuttled Mission |work=[[Wired News]] |date=2008-09-24 |url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/09/enomoto_lawsuit |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021104401/http://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/09/enomoto_lawsuit |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Spencer |last=Reiss |title=Space Get Up |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 2006 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/start.html?pg=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His planned experiment was to put together one or more [[Gundam model]]s in [[zero gravity]].&lt;ref name="wired1" /&gt;

In 2012, FinBank merged with First City Monument Bank(FCMB), allowing them to become the 7th largest bank in Nigeria in terms of branch network and coverage. Prior to the merger, FinBank had about 180 branches in the 36 states of Nigeria. Post Merger, the new bank (FCMB) has over 310 branches, including a branch in the [[United Kingdom]] and business office in South Africa.

The '''Handelsgesetzbuch''' ('''HGB''', in English ''Commercial Code'') contains the core of the commercial law in Germany. It regulates the legal relations of merchants and therefore it is also designated as "the special private law for merchants".  

The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]] (English ''Civil Code'') is only subsidiary applied to merchants beside the HGB. 
Beside that the HGB contains the regulations for the Offene Handelsgesellschaft (OHG) (English ''General partnership''), the Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) (English ''Limited partnership'') and the Stille Gesellschaft (stG) (English ''Dormant partnership'').

HGB provides regulation to accounting for limited companies.

HGB also has a few penal provisions.

== History ==
Precursor of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) was the [[Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch|Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB)]] of 1861. ADHGB was replaced in the [[German Empire]] by the HGB, that was legislated on 10 May 1897. The HGB came into force together with the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]] on 1 January 1900.

== Content ==
HGB also contains in the fifth Book the Maritime Trade Law (Seehandelsrecht).

'''Hog Island''' is the historic name of an area southeast of [[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania]] along the [[Delaware River]], to the west of the mouth of the [[Schuylkill River]]. [[Philadelphia International Airport]] now sits on the land that was once Hog Island.

==History==
European settlers purchased Hog Island from the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) tribe in 1680.  The settlers gradually developed the island by building log and earthwork dikes to minimize storm damage and convert the marshes into good grazing meadows. Hog Island supposedly got its name from the pigs which local residents left to roam free, as no fencing was needed.

[[File:Air view of Emergency Fleet Corporation's Hog Island yard.png|thumb|Air view of Emergency Fleet Corporation's Hog Island yard.]]
In 1917, as part of the [[World War I]] effort, the US government contracted [[American International Shipbuilding]] to build [[ship]]s and a [[shipyard]] at Hog Island.  At the time Hog Island was the largest shipyard in the world, with 50 [[slipway]]s.  The first ship (named {{SS|Quistconck}} for the Lenape name for the site) was christened August 5, 1918, by [[Edith Bolling Wilson]], wife of US president [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Worcester |first1=Kimball |title=The Great War's Largest Shipyard: Hog Island, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |url=http://roadstothegreatwar-ww1.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-wars-largest-shipyard-hog.html |website=roadstothegreatwar-ww1.blogspot.com |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shipbuilding process practiced on Hog Island was an early experiment in standardized construction of ships.  The ships built there, known as "[[Hog Islander]]s", were considered ugly but well built.  In all, 122 Hog Islanders were built, mostly cargo ships, and a few troop transport ships.  The shipbuilding continued until 1921, after which the facility was rapidly demolished.  None of the ships were ready in time to participate in World War I, but many of them were involved in [[World War II]].  Two of the locomotive steam gantry cranes were sold as surplus to the city of [[Trenton, New Jersey]], where they remain today as the [[Hog Island Cranes]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kardas|first1=S.|last2=Larrabee|first2=E.|title=Hog Island Cranes|url={{NRHP url|id=80002500}}|website=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another crane, a 20-ton Industrial locomotive crane, was sold to the [[Hyde, McFarlan &amp; Burke]] contracting company.&lt;ref name="ironage1921"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UydKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1151&amp;lpg=PA1151&amp;dq=Hyde,+McFarlan+%26+Burke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z-yVmAM9Pb&amp;sig=mQv8HByowVjR0pQKRUzvTyjxUL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim0M-rtMbKAhWNPB4KHQEMA3oQ6AEIMzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hyde%2C%20McFarlan%20%26%20Burke%22&amp;f=false | title=Machinery Markets and News of the Works | journal=The Iron Age | date=March 1921 | volume=107 | page=1151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] filled in the creek separating Hog Island from the mainland with silt dredged out of the shipping channels so that Hog Island became part of the mainland. Starting in 1925, the Pennsylvania [[Air National Guard]] used a small part of Hog Island as a training field for its pilots. In 1927, the site was dedicated as the "Philadelphia Municipal Airport" by [[Charles Lindbergh]], who flew in on the [[Spirit of Saint Louis]].  In 1930 the city of Philadelphia purchased Hog Island from the federal government for $3 million, in order to expand the airport.  Because of the [[Great Depression]], work on the airport did not actually begin until 1937, and the airport was formally opened as Philadelphia Municipal Airport on June 20, 1940.

==Cultural context==
One [[Submarine sandwich|legend of the origin]] of the [[hoagie]] sandwich is tied to Hog Island. Domenic Vitiello, professor of Urban Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, asserts that Italians working on Hog Island in the old [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|Navy Yard]] introduced the sandwich, by putting various meat, cheese, and lettuce between two slices of bread. This became known as the "Hog Island" sandwich; hence, the "hoagie".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.34st.com/article/2007/04/node-3965 Philly Via Italy]", ''thirtyfourthstreetmagazine'', April 17, 2007, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James McCosh Clark''' (12 August 1833 – 26 January 1898) was mayor of Auckland, New Zealand, in the 1880s. He was a successful businessman until many of his ventures failed during the depression of the 1880s, causing him to return to England for the last decade of his life. He was the son of [[Archibald Clark (politician)|Archibald Clark]].

==Early life==
Clark was born in [[Beith]], Scotland, in 1833, the eldest son of the merchant [[Archibald Clark (politician)|Archibald Clark]] and his first wife, Margaret McCosh.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark"&gt;{{DNZB|McCallum|Janet |2c18|Clark, Kate Emma – Biography|18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Largs]].&lt;ref name="Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. James McCosh Clark|url=http://gilliandr.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/death-of-a-native-of-beith-1898/|accessdate=19 September 2011|newspaper=Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald|date=4 February 1898|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archibald Clark decided to emigrate to New Zealand with his third wife and four children; the family left London on the barque ''Thames'' on 18 July 1849 and arrived in [[Auckland]] on 25 November.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shipping Lists|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=DSC18491127.2.3|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Daily Southern Cross|volume=V |issue=252 |date=27 November 1849|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archibald Clark &amp; Sons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Archibald Clark &amp; Sons, Limited.|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TO19080815.2.70|accessdate=17 September 2011|newspaper=Observer|volume=XXVIII |issue=48 |date=15 August 1908|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He joined the Volunteer Forces and was a captain in the [[Invasion of Waikato]] in 1863.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;

==Professional life==
Clark joined his father's company as a partner in 1856 or 1857, and the company was renamed Archibald Clark and Sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;  They manufactured clothing and were a wholesaler, at one time employing some 500 staff.{{sfn|Cyclopedia Company Limited|1902|p=103}}  Clark became the senior partner following his father's death in October 1875.  He was involved in numerous other companies.  His investment in the Moanataiari gold mining company made him a rich man.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;  Moanataiari is now a suburb of [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] in the [[Coromandel Peninsula|Coromandel]].

Together with [[John Logan Campbell (politician)|John Logan Campbell]], [[Gustav von der Heyde]], [[John Shera]] and others, Clark set up the New Zealand Freight Company in 1872, which amalgamated with the New Zealand Shipping Company the following year.{{sfn|Brett |1924 |p=359}}  All the Auckland shipping owners combined into one company in 1881, the [[Northern Steamship Company|Northern Steam Ship Company]], of which Clark was appointed one of the directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Birth of the Northern Steam Ship Company |url= http://www.nzmaritimeindex.org.nz/nssco/birth.htm |publisher=Voyager New Zealand Maritime Museum|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The depression in the second half of the 1880s affected this company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaky Beginnings 1881–1887 |url= http://www.nzmaritimeindex.org.nz/nssco/shaky_beginnings.htm |publisher=Voyager New Zealand Maritime Museum| accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Clark managed to the secure the services of a new managing director in 1888 who could turn the situation around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ranson Period 1887–1921 |url= http://www.nzmaritimeindex.org.nz/nssco/ranson.htm |publisher=Voyager New Zealand Maritime Museum| accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark was one of the financial backers of business entrepreneur [[Thomas Russell (New Zealand politician)|Thomas Russell]], who in 1859 had founded the [[NZI|New Zealand Insurance]] (NZI).  The group of businessmen and companies behind Russell became known as the Limited Circle, and they were financing much of the development of Auckland.  The funds came from the proceeds of the Thames gold rush.&lt;ref name="crony capitalists"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunt|first=Graeme|title=Auckland: Rise of the crony capitalists|url=http://mobile.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.php?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10666749|accessdate=25 September 2011|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Limited Circle founded the [[Bank of New Zealand]] in 1861 and Clark was on the board of directors.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crony capitalists" /&gt;  He was president of the [[Auckland Chamber of Commerce]] in 1879–1881.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;

With [[Josiah Firth]], Clark established the Te Aroha Battery Company, a gold mining company. It was one of the many speculative deals which did not go well, and the depression in the second half of the 1880s necessitated a sale, which was done in 1887 incurring a great loss.  The [[Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company]] was another such venture; it built parts of the [[Rotorua Branch|Rotorua]] and [[Kinleith Branch|Kinleith]] branches before its collapse.  While Archibald Clark and Sons prospered, several other of Clark's businesses failed, and having lost his high standing in society, he took his family back to England in 1889.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:James McCosh Clark, 1882.jpg|thumb|left|upright|James McCosh Clark in 1882 during his time as [[Mayor of Auckland City|Mayor of Auckland]]]]
Clark was a member of the [[Auckland Province|Auckland Provincial Council]], representing the Newton electorate on the 6th Council from December 1869 to September 1870.{{sfn|Scholefield |1950|p=182}}

He was [[Mayor of Auckland City|Mayor of Auckland]] from 1880 to 1883.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;  In November 1880, 1881 and 1882, respectively, he was elected unopposed on all occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Mayor|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=AS18801116.2.36 |accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Auckland Star|volume=XI |issue=3221 |date=16 November 1880|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auckland|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DTN18811123.2.22.4|accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=23 November 1881|issue=3244|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auckland|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=THS18821117.2.8.2|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Thames Star|volume=XIII |issue=4331 |date=17 November 1882|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his term in Office, the first [[Trams in New Zealand#Auckland|tramway]] (Horse drawn) was constructed and the site for the [[Auckland Town Hall]] was purchased. Clark's council also decided on the site of the library and art gallery, still occupied today by the [[Auckland Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Thames Star obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of James McCosh Clark|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=THS18980128.2.26 |accessdate=19 September 2011|newspaper=Thames Star|volume=XXX |issue=8978 |date=28 January 1898|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{NZHPT|92|Auckland City Art Gallery|20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On retiring from the mayoralty, he was given a [[telescope]] in appreciation of his services.{{sfn|Cyclopedia Company Limited|1902|p=125}}  In 1886–1887, Clark represented the Grafton ward as a Councillor.{{sfn|Cyclopedia Company Limited|1902|p=130}}  Other local body roles included the chairmanship of the Auckland Harbour Board and of the Education Board.{{sfn|Cyclopedia Company Limited |1902 |p=126}}

Clark stood for [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] on three occasions.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;  In the [[New Zealand general election, 1875–76|1875–76 general election]], he was nominated by [[Thomas Peacock (politician)|Thomas Peacock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nominations at City East|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18751223.2.26|accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Auckland Star|volume=VI |issue=1827 |date=23 December 1875|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but unsuccessfully contested the [[Auckland East]] electorate against [[William Lee Rees]], polling 266 votes against 300.{{sfn|Scholefield |1950|p=134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auckland|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TH18760101.2.16.1 |accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Taranaki Herald|volume=XXIV |issue=2373 |date=1 January 1876|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark then contested the Auckland East electorate in the [[New Zealand general election, 1879|1879 general election]] against [[William Speight]] and was narrowly defeated with 363 to 371 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The City East Election|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18790915.2.43 |accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Auckland Star|volume=X |issue=2939 |date=15 September 1879|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark was re-elected mayor in 1881 and declared that he would not stand in the [[New Zealand general election, 1881|1881 general election]], as he could not do justice to both commitments, but he changed his mind when it was announced that Sir [[George Grey]] would stand in Auckland East. It is said that Clark did not intend to be elected, he merely stood to oppose and defeat Grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The True Story of City East Election|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TO18811217.2.20|accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Observer|volume=3 |issue=66 |date=17 December 1881|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were 349 and 315 votes for Grey and Clark, respectively, and Grey was declared elected with a majority of 34 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poll Declarations|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18811210.2.19.1|accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Auckland Star|volume=XII |issue=3540 |date=10 December 1881|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Clark was active in the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] and was the national treasurer for ten years from 1862. In 1865, he purchased The Tower, a large house in Remuera, as his residence.  The building is these days part of [[King's School (Auckland)|King's School]].&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;

He married Kate Emma McCosh Clark (née Woolnough) on 8 April 1875 in Melbourne.  Two days later, on a Saturday, the Auckland premises of Archibald Clark and Sons were closed to give staff the opportunity to celebrate the wedding at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Untitled|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18750410.2.8 |accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Auckland Star|volume=VI |issue=1609 |date=10 April 1875|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife was born at [[Ipswich]], Suffolk, England in 1847.  She studied art and lived in London, earning a living by undertaking research for writers. 
They had five children while they lived in Auckland, and their first son was born on 28 December 1875.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Birth|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18751229.2.7|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Auckland Star|volume=VI |issue=1830 |date=29 December 1875|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many of Clark's businesses had failed, the family migrated to London.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;{{sfn|Platts|1980 |p=158}} While there Kate Emma McCosh Clark wrote the first New Zealand children's story ''A southern cross fairy tale'', which she partly illustrated, published in London in 1891. Her last work ''Maori tales and legends'' (1896), was intended to interest and instruct young people about New Zealand and the Maori.
In early 1898, they were making plans to return to New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald obit" /&gt;

==Death==
Clark died on 26 January 1898 at [[St Leonards-on-Sea]]. He was survived by his wife and his five children.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald obit" /&gt;  His wife returned to New Zealand in 1900 and died at Auckland on 3 November 1926.&lt;ref name="DNZB McCosh Clark" /&gt;

In 1977, together with [[Alistair Grant]], a [[marketing]] specialist for whom he had worked with at Fine Fare, and David Webster, a [[merchant bank]]er, he founded James Gulliver Associates. In September 1978, he bought the meat company belonging to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] chairman [[Louis Edwards]] for £100,000 plus shares and renamed it [[Argyll Foods]], acquiring numerous retail concerns including 130 [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] outlets.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Within 10 years of the purchase, the company was worth £1.7&amp;nbsp;billion. Gulliver also bought 100,000 of Edwards' shares in Manchester United for £250,000 and was given a seat on the club's board of directors (although fellow director and former manager [[Matt Busby]] abstained from the vote to give Gulliver a seat, saying he did not know who Gulliver was).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Dewhurst |title=When You Put on a Red Shirt |year=2009 |publisher=Yellow Jersey Press |location=London |isbn=9780224082839 |page=258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulliver later became the club's vice-president.

'''Krit Ratanarak''' ({{th-lang|กฤตย์ รัตนรักษ์}}; {{RTGS|''Krit Rattanarak''}}; born 19 April 1946) is the Chairman of [[Bangkok Broadcasting &amp; Television Company]] (operator of Channel 7) and head of one of Thailand’s leading family business groups.  The Ratanarak family have substantial holdings in a number of Thai-based companies including [[Bank of Ayudhya|Krungsri Bank]], Siam City Cement, Allianz Ayudhya, Sri Ayudhya Capital, Matching Studio, Media of Medias and Eastern Star Real Estate as well as holding a majority stake in BBTV.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Family==
Krit Ratanarak was born in 1946 and is the eldest of six children with five sisters, four of whom now live outside Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3715/is_199809/ai_n8814582/pg_33/ |title=Global Finance 600: The world's most powerful financial players |publisher=BNET Find Articles |accessdate=2009-11-09 |year=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026001643/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3715/is_199809/ai_n8814582/pg_33/ |archivedate=26 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Sasithorn, still lives in [[Bangkok]].  

The Ratanarak family are known to be very private; Forbes call them ‘a very secretive clan’&lt;ref name="forbesmag"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Forbes Magazine|date=18 July 1994|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Krit’s son Chachchon has been described as being ‘influential while staying below the radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Business Report Thailand|date=January 2012|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ratanaraks are one of the few remaining ‘old money’ families in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Forbes Magazine|date=18 July 1994|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krit is the son of [[Chuan Ratanarak]], who founded Bank of Ayudhya (known today as Krungsri Bank), Siam City Cement (producer of the Insee Cement brand) and Bangkok Broadcasting and Television &lt;ref&gt;Hiscock (1997), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of Thailand’s last great self-made business Titans.&lt;ref name="chuan"&gt;{{cite news|title=BANK OF AYUDHYA CHAIRMAN PASSES AWAY|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=4 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krit took over the family businesses after the death of his father in 1993.

==Career==
Ratanarak is one of the most successful and businessmen in Thailand.&lt;ref name=forbesmag /&gt; He joined [[Bank of Ayudhya]] in 1972 becoming President in 1982 and CEO in 1990. In 1993 he became Chairman and CEO of the bank, Chairman of BBTV, Chairman of Siam City Cement and Chairman of Ayudhya Insurance.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, Ratanarak navigated [[Bank of Ayudhya]] and the other family businesses through the worst of the Asian financial crisis with the result that the Ratanaraks were one of only 8 business groups that had been in Thailand’s top 40 in 1979 to survive in the top rankings in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the crisis Ratanarak strengthened the major family businesses by introducing outside capital and international management expertise.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt;

Ratanarak recapitalised Siam City Cement in 1998 in the process selling part of the family’s equity to Holderbank (later to become [[Holcim]]). Contemporary newspaper reports wrongly suggested that the sale of equity to Holderbank was used by the family to raise the funds required to recapitalize Bank of Ayudhya.  However, as part of the terms of the sale, the full proceeds received by the family from Holderbank – as well as additional funds from the Ratanarak Group - were reinvested in Siam City Cement via a rights issue to recapitalize the business and the capital injected by the family into the bank came instead from contingency reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before Nowadays…40 Years of Siam City Cement PCL.

While other banks closed or were nationalized, Ratanarak completed a recapitalization of Bank of Ayudhya,&lt;ref name=ASEAN&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Akira Suehiro|author2=Natenapha Wailerdsak|title=Family Business in Thailand|journal=ASEAN Economic Bulletin|year=2004|volume=21|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bank continued to improve its performance in the post-crisis aftermath.  In 1996 before the crisis the bank had a market value of US $4 billion in 2014 prices&lt;ref name="DJ Stock 1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand Closing Stock Prices|work=Dow Jones Newswire|accessdate=20 August 2013|date=10 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this had risen to US $7 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies/Securities in Focus|url=http://www.set.or.th/set/companyprofile.do?symbol=BAY&amp;language=en&amp;country=US|website=The Stock Exchange of Thailand|accessdate=2 July 2014|ref=Bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family shareholding in the bank was reduced in 2007 from 35%&lt;ref name=AWSJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Utumporn|first=Pichayaporn|title=Bank of Ayudhya Share-Issue Plan Pleases Shareholders and Analysts|newspaper=The Asian Wall Street Journal|date=7 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 25%&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt; to comply with a reduction in the maximum permitted holding under new banking regulations which came into force in 2008.  The reduction in the family’s holding was taken up by GE Capital whom the family brought into the management of the bank in 2007 to install best practice.&lt;ref name=NationBAY&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanoksilp|first=Jiwamol|title=BAY gears up for new era as Krit steps down|newspaper=The Nation (Thailand)|date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 GE Capital sold their holding to Japan’s MUFJ following losses incurred in the 2008 banking crisis,&lt;ref name=bloombergnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Vallikappen|first=Sanat|title=GE Raises $462 Million From Selling 7.6% of Bank of Ayudhya|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/ge-raises-462-million-from-selling-7-6-of-bank-of-ayudhya-1-.html|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=8 April 2013|author2=Joyce Koh|author3=Anuchit Nguyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a change in strategy by GE to reduce their exposure to financial services.&lt;ref name=lex&gt;{{cite news|last=Lex|title=General Electric: the long game|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/3/d95e609c-a073-11e2-88b6-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper=Financial Times|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Ratanarak family controlled 25% of the bank’s equity with the remaining equity held by MUFJ.&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt;

The Ratanarak Group emerged from the crisis with Ratanarak at the head of one of the top five business families in Thailand,&lt;ref name=ASEAN /&gt; and one of three of Thailand’s most powerful banking families along with the Sophonpanich and [[Lamsam family|Lamsam]] families.&lt;ref name=Wingfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Gomez|first=Edmund|title=Political business in East Asia|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-27149-5|pages=253–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, Ratanarak has added property companies Eastern Star and Grand Canal Land and media company Matching Maximise Solution to the family business group.

In 1981 Ratanarak became Thailand’s youngest senator at the age of 35, serving for four terms.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International''' ({{lang-ar|المؤسسة اللبنانية للإرسال انترناسيونال}}), widely known as '''LBCI''', is a private television station in [[Lebanon]]. LBCI was founded in 1992 by acquiring the assets, liabilities and logo of LBC, an entity founded in 1985 during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] by the Lebanese Forces.&lt;ref name=sk&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanese media coverage of oil and gas sector|url=http://www.mestrategicperspectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lebanese-Media-Coverage-of-the-Oil-and-Gas-Sector.pdf|publisher=SKeyes|accessdate=16 September 2014|date=August 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; LBCI went global in 1996 when it launched its satellite channel LBC ''Al-Fadha'iya Al-Lubnaniya'' ({{lang-ar|الفضائية اللبنانية}}) covering [[Lebanon]], the [[Arab world]], [[Europe]], [[Americas|America]], [[Australia]] and [[Africa]]. Ownership of LBCI is currently in dispute between the [[Lebanese Forces]] party and a group of Lebanese businessmen led by the company CEO Pierre El-Daher.

==Post-war era==
The Lebanese Forces, a militia that had founded LBC in 1985,&lt;ref name=sk/&gt; was militarily and financially weakened by [[Lebanese civil war]] which ended in 1990 and its leader [[Samir Geagea]] was imprisoned in 1994. In 1992 Pierre El Daher had founded LBCI along with other shareholders and registered it at the Commercial Register of Baabda . El Daher was the driving force for the purchase by LBCI of LBC's assets.

In April 1996, El Daher and other shareholders launched LBCsat  a free satellite channel . The new channel was a success, especially to the Lebanese diaspora, disseminated throughout the world.

In 2003, as a result of an agreement between Saleh Kamel, founder of LMH company (Lebanese Media Holding, owner of 49% of LBC SAT and Pac 's shares ) and [[Al-Waleed bin Talal|Al Waleed bin Talal]], the latter, through Kingdom, replaced Kamel in LMH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.middleeastevents.com/site/pres_dtls.asp?pid=94 |title=Saudi's Prince Alwaleed Buys 49% Stake In LBCsat from Sheikh Saleh Kamel of Art|publisher=Middle East Events|date=3 December 2003|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, it was decided to increase the capital of LMH considerably. Accordingly, HRH Al-Waleed Bin Talal became the largest shareholder after acquiring the absolute majority in PAC (a content provider for both LBCI and LBC SAT) and LBC SAT, based on an understanding that the capital increase would be invested to improve the programs’ network and upgrade productivity under the supervision of Sheikh Pierre Daher.

In 2010, Rupert Murdoch joined the group and PAC and LBC SAT were merged with Rotana. Rumor was that this merger would improve and develop the group, which seemed an obvious result of the cooperation between the Saudi prince and the owner of the biggest media empire in the world, Rupert Murdoch. These expectations did not materialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/26385/what-is-the-real-story-behind-pac |title=What is the real story behind PAC?|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Al Hayat and LBC SAT merger==
[[File:Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation logo.png|right|100px|Al Hayat LBC SAT logo]]
At the end of the year 2002, LBC SAT and the London-based ''[[Al Hayat]]'' newspaper owned by Saudis, merged their news programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-95439751.html |title=First merger of TV, print press in Middle East. - Xinhua News Agency |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=1994-03-10 |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; LBC SAT daily news bulletin was called the "Al Hayat-LBC SAT  news bulletin". The cooperation ended in 2010.

==LBCI ownership battle==
The Lebanese Forces, initiated proceedings in Lebanon claiming ownership of LBCI and alleging criminal violations by Mr. El Daher. The Court of Appeal rejected these claims but the Court of Cassation - Criminal Chamber decided to refer the case to the Sole Criminal Judge in Beirut.

The Sole Criminal Judge in Beirut will in due course examine the case as a trial judge and will decide on the substance. His decisions are subject to appeal before the Beirut Court and cassation before the competent court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/57115/lbci-company-will-not-be-affected-by-the-decision LBCI: Company will not be affected by the decision of the Court of Cassation] LBCI 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liquid Roofing and Waterproofing Association (LRWA)''' is a UK member organisation of manufacturers of liquid applied coatings for buildings.  The association's aim is to educate and inform specifiers, contractors, and the industry as to the properties, correct applications, installation methods, and aftercare of [[liquid roofing|liquid waterproofing systems]].

==History==
The association was formed in the 1970s and was originally known as the '''BRCMA (Bituminous Roof Coating Manufacturers Association)'''. The primary purpose of the association was to promote good practice in all areas of the UK bituminous roof coatings industry.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the rise in popularity of non-bituminous products and in particular [[liquid roofing]].

Recognising this trend, the association reinvented itself as ELRA (European Liquid Roofing Association), now focusing solely on [[liquid roofing]] systems. The 'European' tag reflected the associations involvement in the drafting of European standards for all areas of [[liquid roofing]].

In 2005 a second reinvention took place as '''ELRA''' became '''ELWA (European Liquid Waterproofing Association)''' in recognition of the wider applications for liquid waterproofing products, for example the protection and [[waterproofing]] of [[car park]] decks.

In 2010 the association identified a need for an industry voice for [[liquid roofing]], which was and remains the fastest growing sector of the roofing market in the UK. The 'European' label was dropped as the association re-launched as '''LRWA (Liquid Roofing and Waterproofing Association)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrwa.org.uk/Our-History |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001231113/http://www.lrwa.org.uk/Our-History |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prinz von Anhalt claims his parents owned a jewelry store, before their business was declared bankrupt and the family lost vast amounts of their wealth.&lt;ref name="princegermany.com/aboutme"&gt;princegermany.com/aboutme/&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, Eberhardt held many jobs, and left school at 16 to become an apprentice butcher. He started a cleaning service, which was a subsidiary for the butcher business, and was receiving a combined income of 6000 Deutsche Mark at age 16. He completed another apprenticeship to become a chef, opening several restaurants and starting an interior design business.&lt;ref name="princegermany.com/aboutme"/&gt;

Eberhardt further diversified his organisation by opening several table-dance bars and gentlemen's clubs in the [[United States]]. He later bought several brothels, earning the nickname "red-light king." After this investment, Eberhardt was charged with money laundering, tax fraud and human trafficking.&lt;ref name="princegermany.com/aboutme"/&gt;

He is one of the largest and most visible owners of [[prostitution in Germany|brothels in Germany]], with over twenty brothels and night clubs. He has served four years in prison,&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/a-580861.html Pamelas Prinz], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 29 September 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; for human trafficking and tax evasion.&lt;ref name=sw&gt;[http://www.suedwest-aktiv.de/region/swp_neuulm/ulm_und_neu_ulm/3975954/artikel.php Der Bordellkönig besucht sein Reich], ''Südwest Presse'', 19 November 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to be a millionaire "in the three digit range," owning about 40 cars, real estate in Los Angeles (a mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] he shares with [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] and [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]]), [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Pforzheim]], [[St. Gallen]], [[Dubai]] and [[Monaco]], and to have 12 bodyguards and 25 servants.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sw"/&gt;

==Adoption and title==
In 2006, he bought his name for several million U.S. dollars by being adopted by [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]], husband of [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], who had himself obtained his name by adoption. The adoption and name change did not confer any actual title or nobility. "Prinz von Anhalt" is a surname (literally Prince of Anhalt), rather than a title, as per German laws abolishing [[German nobility|the country's former nobility]] in 1919. Furthermore, the [[Duchy of Anhalt|Anhalt family]] does not include Marcus Prinz von Anhalt as a member. He likes to refer to himself as "Prinz Germany." His brothers by adoption include Oliver Prinz von Anhalt, Michael Prinz von Anhalt and Markus Maximilian Prinz von Anhalt. His sister by adoption is [[Francesca Hilton]], who is the stepdaughter of his adoptive father and birth daughter of his adoptive mother. In 2008, he organized the "Royal Race," a tour of expensive cars and prominent drivers across Europe. [[Pamela Anderson]] was his partner at the race.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; In February 2009 he was seen having lunch with her in Los Angeles. In 2009, when Zsa Zsa Gabor lost a substantial amount of money to [[Bernie Madoff]]'s [[Ponzi scheme]], he helped out with a cheque for $6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princegermany.com/press/press145.html Sein Adoptivsohn hilft ihm aus der Patsche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307040411/http://www.princegermany.com/press/press145.html |date=7 March 2009 }}, ''Freizeitwoche'', 18 February 2009. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
In November 2014 Marcus Prinz von Anhalt was sentenced to prison again. The judgment is not legally binding yet. While appealing the sentence, Prinz von Anhalt spent two years in detention.&lt;ref name=spiegel2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diehl |first1=Jörg |title=Verdacht der Steuerhinterziehung: Der Prinz und sein Porsche-Problem |trans-title=Suspected of tax evasion: The prince and his Porsche problem |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/steuerhinterziehung-prinz-marcus-von-anhalt-in-haft-a-966234.html |newspaper=Spiegel Online |accessdate=24 November 2018 |date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordbayern.de/ressorts/schlagzeilen/protz-prinz-marcus-von-anhalt-muss-vier-jahre-ins-gefangnis-1.4132886 |title=′Protz-Prinz′ Marcus von Anhalt muss vier Jahre ins Gefängnis |date=16 January 2015 |website=nordbayern.de |publisher=[[Nürnberger Nachrichten]] |language=de |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prison sentence of 4 years was based on charges of tax evasion and fraud.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; The prosecution had accused Prinz von Anhalt of tax evasion of 1.5 million Euros.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; The prosecution had put forward an estimation of monetary damages for the tax authorities by Anhalt of Euro 747,000&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; and another attempt to evade taxes of Euro 820,000.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; In particular, the prosecution accused von Anhalt that he declared the private usage of his 14&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; luxury cars (all of a value of at least 1 Million Euros&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt;) and vacations in Las Vegas as professional and business expenditures towards the tax authorities.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; Von Anhalt argued that "his glamorous lifestyle" is part of his profession as a "TV star" and that therefore, he merely used his luxury cars for "representational" reasons, stating: "Driving in my [[Porsche]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] and traveling to a show in [[Las Vegas]] occurred for professional reasons only."&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; In addition, von Anhalt attempted to persuade the judge and the prosecution that if he did commit tax evasion, then it must have been unintentional as he did not fully understand the German tax laws at the time concerned, stating: "I know that the German tax laws are extremely complicated and maybe even the most complicated in the world. Some people may be able to understand the German tax laws but he is not one of them; but he knows how to successfully manage a brothel".&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; The judges did not believe von Anhalt's explanations and consequently imposed a prison sentence of 4 years. Von Anhalt had declared previously that "he does not see a criminal offense in his case"&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; and that the sums he supposedly evaded from tax authorities are "petty"&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; and "ridiculous"&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; given that "his brothels and disco clubs generate revenues in the two digit million range."&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt;

In prison it was discovered that von Anhalt had sent a letter to an acquaintance where he would insult the district attorney who had represented the prosecution in von Anhalts trial.&lt;ref name="Focus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus: 60,000 Euro Strafe - Von Anhalt beleidigt Staatsanwalt|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/vermischtes/brief-aus-jva-abgefangen-60-000-euro-strafe-protz-prinz-beleidigt-staatsanwalt_id_4773236.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Anhalt had stated in the letter that "the district attorney is probably the dumbest district attorney in the world, that he has serious personal issues, that he squints and is poky and he merely is a cheap George Clooney wannabe."&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt; Von Anhalt was consequently imposed a fine of 60,000 Euros.&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt;

==Connections to Hells Angels==
Marcus Prinz von Anhalt reportedly has connections to the [[Hells Angels]] with whom von Anhalt engaged with in the past as business or security partners for his brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburger Allgemeine: Der Protz-Prinz und der Höllenengel|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Der-Protz-Prinz-und-der-Hoellenengel-id32641947.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Prinz von Anhalt has a daughter, Zsana Prinzessin von Anhalt, named for her adoptive grandmother [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]].

Born in a poor family of whom both parents worked as rubber-tapers, while the father also drives school buses too in the morning, he was set to change the family’s fate.

== Disabled community’s voice in manifesto campaign ==
One of the most notable issues raised and became a manifesto of Dr Mazlan during the general election was the pledge to assist the needy particularly the disabled community in Malaysia.
Inspired by his own eldest son who's an OKU (Orang Kelainan Upaya) with blind disability from birth, Dr Mazlan is set to bring up the disabled community’s voice into parliament if he was elected into it. Notable appearance of his son was when he prayed in public for his father’s victory in the election ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-dFBPi2ym0 video]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.bharian.com.my/bharian/articles/PRU13__Anakistimewa_Mazlanharapayahmenang/m/mArticle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150413205007/http://www2.bharian.com.my/bharian/articles/PRU13__Anakistimewa_Mazlanharapayahmenang/m/mArticle |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Mazlan was quoted saying that having had a personal experience in raising a disabled child, he empathise and understand more of the feeling and challenges faced by parents with similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.nst.com.my/latest/permatang-pauh-personal-touch-of-bn-candidate-1.270651&lt;/ref&gt; He promised to adopt three existing rehabilitative centres in the constituency, namely in Kampung Pertama, Seberang Jaya and Kampung Tanah Liat.

== Social contribution ==

In the aftermath of the Malaysia’s 13th General Election where Dr Mazlan lost to the incumbent Anwar Ibrahim, he took the chance of his reputation by establishing a religious study centre for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/studies-centre-to-unite-muslims-malays |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081545/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/studies-centre-to-unite-muslims-malays |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Dalam_Negeri/20130716/dn_14/Rumah-Penyatuan-Ummah-semai-perpaduan-masyarakat-Islam&lt;/ref&gt; With the objective to unite the people regardless of political ideology, and where everyone can come and study Al Quran or hear religious sermons, Pusat Pengajian Darul Wehdah was set up in Simpang Tiga Kubang Ulu, aiming to hold programmes focusing on education, motivation, development issues and women. He criticized religious-schools that were used to incite hatred towards political enemies and these are detrimental to the people’s unity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.negarakita.com/Post-806688-Ribuan+rakyat+hadiri+Majlis+Kesyukuran+Ramadhan+Dr+Mazlan+Isnail&lt;/ref&gt;
The study centre has since organized various programmes especially the weekly sermons, Islamic event talks and others. Videos of the programmes held can be watched in [http://darulwehdah.blogspot.co.uk/ Darul Wehdah’s youtube channel] and [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Darul-wehdah/141556305922700 Facebook page].

In 1969 he joined the Central Bank of Malta as a research assistant and later served as senior research officer from 1971 to 1978. Bonello was also president of the Malta Branch of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, now the Institute of Financial Services. In 1978, he left the bank to join the private sector, where he held senior management positions and sat on the councils of the Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Industry until he joined UNCTAD in 1983.

He was initially appointed governor of the Central Bank of Malta on 1 October 1999. His appointment has been extended for five years, with effect from 1 October 2008.

'''Count Mihály Mátyás Cseszneky de Milvány et Csesznek''' (1910–1975) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] industrialist and [[nobility|nobleman]], and nominal [[Grand Voivodeship of Macedonia|Grand Voivode of Macedonia]].

Count Mihály Cseszneky's father was an inventor and impoverished aristocrat, while his mother was the only daughter and heir of a wealthy grain merchant with extended commercial links throughout [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Balkans]]. After [[World War I]], most of their properties were confiscated by the Serbian government. 

In the 1930s, Count Cseszneky played an important role in the restoration of the mill industry of Hungary. In September 1943, after the forced abdication of his brother [[Count Gyula Cseszneky de Milvány et Csesznek]], he was proclaimed Grand Voivode of Macedonia, but he did not respond to the offer. During the Nazi German occupation of Hungary he actively helped his former business partner [[Giorgio Perlasca]] to save the life of the persecuted Jews. 

After World War II his properties were confiscated by the Hungarian and Yugoslav Communist regimes. As an aristocrat and prominent supporter of the [[Civic Democratic Party (Hungary)|Civic Democratic Party]], he was labelled a class enemy and was deported to a re-education camp, along with his wife and young children. As a political prisoner, Count Mihály Cseszneky spent several years in jail and forced labour camps in [[Komló]] and [[Sztálinváros]]. He died in 1975.

Count Mihály married a Hungarian noble lady with whom he had four children, among them [[Count László Cseszneky de Milvány et Csesznek]], whose son [[Count Miklós Cseszneky de Milvány et Csesznek]] is the current head of the family.

'''Nils Persson''' (January 20, 1836 – April 28, 1916) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[Consul (representative)|consul]], businessman, and politician from [[Helsingborg]].

Persson was born in [[Allerum]], [[Sweden]]. He started his career career as a fifteen-year-old in 1851, as a shop assistant in a store run by his uncle.&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nils Persson |url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=7119 |website=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 he opened his own business,&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; where he imported and sold [[guano]] for use in fertilizers. The operation went well, and from 1872 to 1875 he ran the company ''Nils Persson's guano-svavvelsyrefabrik'' (Nils Persson's Guano–Sulfuric Acid Factory) in Helsingborg. In 1875 he became the director and chairman of the company ''Skånska superfosfat- og svafvelsyrefabrik AB'' (Skåne Superphosphate and Sulfuric Acid Factory, now part of [[Kemira]]), also in Helsingborg.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johannesson |first1=Gösta |title=Skåne, Halland og Blekinge: om Skånelandskapens historia |date=1984 |publisher=Norstedts |location=Stockholm |page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this he needed phosphate and sulfuric acid. In the beginning, the phosphorus was obtained from fossil bones, but soon he started imported phosphorus from Florida and North Africa.

In 1887, Persson started the company [[Sulitjelma Mines]] in [[Norway]], where he extracted pyrite. The ore in [[Sulitjelma]] was also rich in copper, which  resulted in him co-founding the Helsingborg Copper Works (''Helsingborgs Kobarverk AB'') in 1900 together with a sulfuric acid plant.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; In Norway, he also mined iron ore. In 1901, he sold his rights in the [[Dunderland Valley]] to the Edison Ore-Milling Syndicate Limited. The sale price was reported to be [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 3 million, which was partly transferred in the form of bonds in the company. Persson was requested to become the "consulting director" of the company, owned by 55 stakeholders, of whom 52 were English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fabelagtige Rigdomme. Dunderlandsdalens kolossale Malm-Dimenssioner |url=https://www.nb.no/items/URN:NBN:no-nb_digavis_nordisktidende_null_null_19010530_11_22_1 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=Nordisk Tidende |date=May 30, 1901 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edison Ore-Milling Syndicate had been created to exploit a method invented by [[Thomas Edison]]. The new method involved processing the iron ore with an electromagnetic separator, resulting in iron concentrates, which were then used to produce pig iron and steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rønhaug |first1=Eliseus Johan |title=Salangen kommune 125 år 1871-1996 : jubileumsskrift |date=1996 |publisher=Kommunen |location=Sjøvegan |isbn=8299396506 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Persson, together with the engineer Alfred Hasselbom, discovered and acquired the rights to the ore deposits at [[Salangen]] in [[Troms]] county. In 1906, Persson sold his rights in Salangen to two German companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bjørklund |first1=Gunnar |last2=Jensvold |first2=Alvin |title=Salangsverket. Et nordnorsk industrieventyr |date=2013 |publisher=Sør-Troms museum |location=Harstad |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, the company Salangen Mining Limited (''Salangen Bergverksaktiebolag'') started up the Salang Works (''Salangsverket''), which were closed down in 1912 after a short but busy period of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wågø |first1=Solvår |title=Ut av svartaste fjell - den rø'aste malm : Salangsverket |date=1997 |publisher=Troms fylkeskommune, Kulturetaten |location=Tromsø |isbn=8278190356 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persson was criticized by some Norwegians for his profitable business in Norway. By a royal decree of October 28, 1907, he and the Røstvangen Company Ltd. (''Aktieselskabet Røstvangen'') were refused their joint application for a license to acquire mining rights at the Røstvangen deposits in [[Hedmark]], in the same area where the [[Røstvangen Mines]] had been established in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dokument nr. 12 |journal=Stortingsforhandlinger |date=1908 |volume=57 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1875 to 1903, Persson served as the vice-consul for the Netherlands. From 1894 to 1911 he was the German consul in Helsingborg.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; Persson died in Helsingborg.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;

'''Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates''' (commonly known as '''"Out &amp; Equal"''') is a [[United States]] lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) workplace equality [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]].

Out &amp; Equal describes its organizational vision as, "To achieve workplace equality for all regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, or characteristics ." Out &amp; Equal provides training and resources to LGBT employees and corporations alike through advocacy, training programs and events.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://outandequal.org/mission-vision Mission/Vision &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt;

Out &amp; Equal achieved 501(c)(3) status in 2004.

==Mission==

Out &amp; Equal's mission is to "educate and empower organizations, human resource professionals, [[Employee Resource Groups]] (ERGs) and individual employees through programs and services that result in equal policies, opportunities, practices, and benefits in the workplace regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, or characteristics".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==History==

Out &amp; Equal's founder, [[Selisse Berry]], was hired in December 1996 by the [[United Way of America|United Way]] of the Bay Area as director of the Building Bridges&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversity-executive.com/article.php?article=427 Who’s Who in Diversity and Inclusion]&lt;/ref&gt; training program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://outandequal.org/history History &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt; The Building Bridges program developed partnerships with fellow LGBT organizations around the Bay Area. Berry ran the program and built coalitions as a single-person staff working out of the [[Pacific Center in Berkeley]], California, and by September 1997 she moved into the United Way Bay Area (UWBA) offices in San Francisco.

[[File:Pride2010.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Out &amp; Equal at San Francisco Pride 2010|Out &amp; Equal at ''[[San Francisco]]'' Pride 2010.]]

By 1998, three LGBT workplace organizations merged in an effort to effectively collaborate on their common mission of creating safe and affirming workplaces for LGBT individuals—called the Pride Collaborative. These organizations included Building Bridges, [[A Group of Groups]] (AGOG), and Progress.

In 1999 [[The Pride Collaborative]] merged with [[COLLEAGUES]], a national organization that sponsored the annual Out &amp; Equal Conference aimed at human resource professionals and LGBT employees, to form Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates, and the current organizational structure was born. That same year, [[Progress's Leadership Summit]] and COLLEAGUES' Out &amp; Equal Conference combined resources to produce the annual Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit, one of the keystone programs of the organization.

In January 2004, after years of being supported by the United Way of the Bay Area, Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates became an independent 501 [c] 3 organization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Out &amp; Equal is headquartered in San Francisco's Financial District and in 2015 announced the opening of a second office in Washington, DC.

[[File:KateClinton.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Comedian Kate Clinton hosts Out &amp; Equal's Outies| [[Kate Clinton]] hosts ''[[The Outies]]'']]

Out &amp; Equal annually holds a training and networking event called the [[Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit]] in rotating locations around the United States. The Workplace Summit hosts thousands of LGBT employees, human resource professionals and organizational representatives each year for a few days of training and networking. The Workplace Summit includes an award ceremony aimed at recognizing leaders in LGBT workplace equality called [[The Outies]].

Out &amp; Equal's Workplace Summit is considered to be appropriate for federal training in compliance with [[5 U.S.C. Chapter 41]]. As proclaimed by Human Resources Director [[John Berry (administrator)|John Berry]] on August 6, 2010, the Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit is open to all federal employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://outandequal.org/annual-summit About the Workplace Summit &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224011735/http://outandequal.org/annual-summit |date=2014-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global LGBT Workplace Summit===
In 2012 Out &amp; Equal held their first international Summit in London. This dynamic event brought together people from around the world to consider ways to build greater equality in the workplace for LGBT people and allies. Attendees came together to share best practices, engage with colleagues from around the world, and strengthen the diversity of global workplaces. Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, IBM Europe Chairman Harry van Dorenmalen, and organizational consultant John Amaechi were among the speakers at the Global LGBT Workplace Summit. The conference featured 24 workshops covering a broad range of topics focused on LGBT workplace issues around the world.[[File:Walllogo.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Out &amp; Equal at Workplace Summit | Out &amp; Equal in Dallas, TX]]

Out &amp; Equal's LGBTCareerLink&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.outandequal.org/resources/lgbt-careerlink/|url = http://www.outandequal.org/resources/lgbt-careerlink/|website = www.outandequal.org|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in November 2008 and serves as a job search engine and professional networking website, designed to expand members' career-building networks by connecting them to other job seekers as well as employment recruiters. LGBTCareerLink allows users to upload job ads, articles and tips, as well as other career-building resources .

==Workplace Policies==
===ENDA===
As a workplace equality advocacy organization, Out &amp; Equal has publicly supported the passage of [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|ENDA]] . Out &amp; Equal has issued public statements urging constituents to contact their United States House Representatives to proceed with the passage of ENDA. During San Francisco Pride Parades, Out &amp; Equal has provided signage to parade participants displaying support for ENDA.

===DADT===
Considering the military a workplace, Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates took an early stance against [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] policies. In February 2008, Selisse Berry wrote in an open letter to Congress and [[Nancy Pelosi]] stating, "We believe that in these times of international crisis (and at all times), the military has a duty to recruit and retain the most qualified people, foster genuine teamwork, and set an example that ALL American citizens matter. We believe that Congress has a moral obligation to repeal policies that have prevented the military from achieving these goals."

===Marriage Equality===
Leading up the 2015 [[Supreme Court of the United States|SCOTUS]] ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates was one of 379 employer organizations that signed on to an ''amicus curiae'' brief&lt;ref&gt;"BRIEF OF 379 EMPLOYERS AND ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING EMPLOYERS AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS [http://www.outandequal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MLB_Employees_Amicus_Brief-Obergefell-v.-Hodges-FINAL-FINAL.pdf " http://www.outandequal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MLB_Employees_Amicus_Brief-Obergefell-v.-Hodges-FINAL-FINAL.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; which urged the High Court to consider the burdens imposed on both employers and employees by a fractured legal landscape with no uniform rule on same-sex marriage.

Out &amp; Equal's "Business Case for Marriage Equality" was penned in 2010 and remains a critical tenant of the organization's overall work.

===Immigration===
In light of national outcry for immigration reform, Out &amp; Equal joined a coalition of LGBT organizations around the United States in a public statement to support the [[Uniting American Families Act]] (UAFA) which protects the rights of same-sex couples during the immigration process into the United States. In a partnership with organizations including [[The Council for Global Equality]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], Out &amp; Equal publicly stated that, "An estimated 17,000 young children are being raised by LGBT parents in binational families and those children face the very real possibility of losing a parent, or leaving the only country they have ever called home."

===Other===
In response to public backlash to Target Corporation's large political donation to anti-gay Republican politician [[Tom Emmer]], Target Corporation publicly called upon the Corporation's continued financial sponsorship of Out &amp; Equal's Workplace Summit. Target CEO [[Gregg Steinhafel]] emphasized Target's relationship with Out &amp; Equal in order to demonstrate the company's commitment to LGBT Workplace equality.

[[File:Screenlogo.jpg|thumb|right|alt= Out &amp; Equal at Workplace Summit | Out &amp; Equal at Workplace Summit.]]

[[Stanford University]] lists Out &amp; Equal as the leading organization for LGBT graduates to turn to for job placement advice.

In 2010, Out &amp; Equal launched a series of editorials called "Communities in Common"&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcjmhk.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/communities-in-common/ Communities in Common &amp;#124; TCJM 香港同志社區聯席]&lt;/ref&gt; written by diverse members of the LGBT community in order to recognize and celebrate the roles of other communities within the struggle for equality.

==Awards and recognitions==

On October 8, 2010 Out &amp; Equal was recognized by [[GLSEN]] for outstanding leadership in LGBT rights at the [[GLSEN Respect Awards]] in Los Angeles, California.

In 2016, Selisse Berry, Founder of Out &amp; Equal, was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for her contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uc.utoronto.ca/bcag2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Organizations==

Out &amp; Equal partners with a variety of organizations to promote LGBT workplace equality. To date, some key partners include [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], [[Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network]], [[International Gay &amp; Lesbian Chamber of Commerce]], [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[Linkage (organization)|Linkage]], [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], [[National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force]], [[Out for Work]], [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]], [[Council for Global Equality]], [[United ENDA]], [[ENDA Now]], [[National Center for Transgender Equality|NCTE]], [[Immigration Equality]] and [[ReachOutUSA]].

[[File:Attendees.jpg|thumb|right|alt= Workplace Summit Attendees | Workplace Summit Attendees.]]
Out &amp; Equal also partners with gay media organizations including [[Diversity Inc]].

==Publications==

In 2013, Out &amp; Equal published its second book, "Out &amp; Equal at Work: From Closet to Corner Office".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.outandequal.org/resources/out-equal-books/|url = http://www.outandequal.org/resources/out-equal-books/|website = www.outandequal.org|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Out &amp; Equal at Work is an anthology of personal narratives from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) executives and straight ally workplace leaders who have ushered in policies that affirm and support the LGBT community in their workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://outandequal.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/out-equal-at-work-from-closet-to-corner-office Out &amp; Equal at Work: From Closet to Corner Office; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palo''' is a memory resident multidimensional ([[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) or multidimensional online analytical processing ([[MOLAP]])) [[database]] server and typically used as a [[business intelligence]] tool for [[management accounting|controlling]] and [[budget]]ing purposes with [[spreadsheet]] software acting as the user interface. Beyond the multidimensional data concept, Palo enables multiple users to share one centralised data storage ([[single version of the truth]]).

This type of [[database]] is suitable to handle complex data models for business management and statistics. Apart from multidimensional queries, data can also be written back and consolidated in real-time. To give rapid access to all data, Palo stores them in the memory during run time. The server is available as [[open-source software|open-source]] and [[proprietary software]].

[[Jedox]] was founded by Kristian Raue in 2002 and developed by Jedox AG, a company based in [[Freiburg]], Germany. The firm currently employs approximately 100 people. Kristian Raue's departure from Jedox was announced in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jedox.com/en/about-jedox/news/kristian-raue-leaves-jedox-ag.html Jedox announces founder's departure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606063250/http://www.jedox.com/en/about-jedox/news/kristian-raue-leaves-jedox-ag.html |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Palo for Excel is an open source [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Microsoft Excel]]. There is also an open source plug-in for [[OpenOffice.org]] named [[PalOOCa]] (discontinued), with Java and web client also available from the JPalo project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpalo.com/en/ Tools, Consulting and Service for Palo]&lt;/ref&gt; Palo can also be integrated into other systems via its client libraries for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[PHP]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], or [[.NET Framework]]. It is fairly easy to communicate with Palo OLAP Server, since it uses [[representational state transfer]] (REST).

Starting in October 2008, Palo supports [[XML for Analysis]] and [[MultiDimensional eXpressions]] (MDX) APIs for connectivity, and [[OLE DB for OLAP]] interface which allows standard Excel pivot tables to serve as a client tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palo Open Source OLAP Server now supports MDX and Excel Pivot Tables |url=http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/10965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting September 2011, Palo supports [http://ssasefprovider.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=sdx&amp;referringTitle=Glossary SDX] dialect of [[LINQ]].

Palo also provides a web-based spreadsheet interface called Palo Web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palo.net/index.php?id=5 Palo Web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720170024/http://www.palo.net/index.php?id=5 |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Palo Suite is a tightly integrated framework consisting of: Palo MOLAP Server, Palo ETL Server, Palo Web (Palo Spreadsheet - Connection, User, ETL, File and Report Manager), Palo for Excel, Palo Supervision Server and the Palo Client Libraries.

The Data in Palo database is stored as a cube in the Palo MOLAP server.  The Palo Excel Add-In component is used as a service to communicate between the Excel and the Palo MOLAP Server.

==Licensing==
Jedox announced only commercial licensing is available since 5.1 version (2015).

'''Prescriptive analytics''' is the third and final phase of [[business analytics]], which also includes descriptive and [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans,James R.  |author2=Lindner, Carl H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Business Analytics: The Next Frontier for Decision Sciences|journal=Decision Line|date=March 2012|volume=43|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"&gt;http://www.analytics-magazine.org/november-december-2010/54-the-analytics-journey{{cite journal|last=Lustig,Irv, Dietrich, Brenda, Johnson, Christer, and Dziekan, Christopher|title=The Analytics Journey|journal=Analytics|date=Nov–Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referred to as the "final frontier of analytic capabilities,"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globys.com/2013/06/gartner-terms-prescriptive-analytics-%E2%80%9Cfinal-frontier%E2%80%9D-analytic-capabilities&lt;/ref&gt; prescriptive analytics entails the application of [[mathematical sciences|mathematical]] and [[computational science]]s and suggests decision options to take advantage of the results of descriptive and predictive analytics.  The first stage of business analytics is descriptive analytics, which still accounts for the majority of all business analytics today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davenport,Tom |title=The three '..tives' of business analytics; predictive, prescriptive and descriptive|journal=CIO Enterprise Forum|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting – such as [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[Business operations|operations]], and [[finance]] – uses this type of post-mortem analysis.

[[File:Three Phases of Analytics.png|thumb|left|350px|Prescriptive Analytics extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes, and the interrelated effects of each decision]]The next phase is [[predictive analytics]]. Predictive analytics answers the question what is likely to happen. This is when historical data is combined with rules, [[algorithms]], and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring. The final phase is prescriptive analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas, Peter J., Maglio, Paul P., Selinger, Patricia G., and Tan, Wang-Chie|title=Data is Dead…Without What-If Models|journal=Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment|year=2011|volume=4|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stewart, Thomas. R. |author2=McMillan, Claude, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Descriptive and Prescriptive Models for Judgment and Decision Making: Implications for Knowledge Engineering|journal=NATO AS1 Senes, Expert Judgment and Expert Systems|year=1987|volume=F35|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen&lt;!-- There is no evidence nor citation supporting this statement. Furthermore, if prescriptive analytics analytics "not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen, then what is the role of predictive modelling, forecasting and causal modelling? --&gt;. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy&lt;!-- This lacks evidence and supporting citation. It does not follow that prediction accuracy improves as a result of re-predicting. --&gt; and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riabacke, Mona, Danielson, Mats, and Ekenber, Love |title=State-of-the-Art Prescriptive Criteria Weight Elicitation|journal=Advances in Decision Sciences|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three phases of analytics can be performed through professional services or technology or a combination.  In order to scale, prescriptive analytics technologies need to be adaptive to take into account the growing volume, velocity, and variety of data that most mission critical processes and their environments may produce.

One criticism of prescriptive analytics is that its distinction from [[predictive analytics]] is ill-defined and therefore ill-conceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bill Vorhies|url=http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/prescriptive-versus-predictive-analytics-distinction-without-difference/ |title=Prescriptive versus Predictive Analytics – A Distinction without a Difference?|journal=Predictive Analytics Times|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Components of Prescriptive Analytics.png|thumb|600px|The scientific disciplines that comprise Prescriptive Analytics]]

==History==

Prescriptive analytics incorporates both structured and unstructured data, and uses a combination of advanced analytic techniques and disciplines to predict, prescribe, and adapt. While the term prescriptive analytics was first coined by IBM&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"/&gt; and later trademarked by Ayata,&lt;ref&gt;http://trademarks.justia.com/852/06/prescriptive-analytics-85206495.html&lt;/ref&gt; the underlying concepts have been around for hundreds of years. The technology behind prescriptive analytics synergistically combines hybrid [[data]], business rules with [[mathematical model]]s and [[computational model]]s. The data inputs to prescriptive analytics may come from multiple sources: internal, such as inside a corporation; and external, also known as environmental data.  The data may be structured, which includes numbers and categories, as well as [[unstructured data]], such as texts, images, sounds, and videos. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|author2=Nesavich, Anthony|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80% of the world's data today is unstructured, according to IBM.

In addition to this variety of data types and growing data volume, incoming data can also evolve with respect to velocity, that is, more data being generated at a faster or a variable pace. Business rules define the [[business process]] and include objectives constraints, preferences, policies, best practices, and boundaries. Mathematical models and computational models are techniques derived from mathematical sciences, computer science and related disciplines such as applied statistics, machine learning, operations research, natural language processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and signal processing. The correct application of all these methods and the verification of their results implies the need for resources on a massive scale including human, computational and temporal for every Prescriptive Analytic project. In order to spare the expense of dozens of people, high performance machines and weeks of work one must consider the reduction of resources and therefore a reduction in the accuracy or reliability of the outcome. The preferable route is a reduction that produces a probabilistic result within acceptable limits.

[[File:Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers.png|thumb|right|450px|Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers]]Energy is the largest industry in the world ($6 trillion in size). The processes and decisions related to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production generate large amounts of data. Many types of captured data are used to create models and images of the Earth’s structure and layers 5,000 - 35,000 feet below the surface and to describe activities around the wells themselves, such as depositional characteristics, machinery performance, oil flow rates, reservoir temperatures and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Basu, Atanu|title= How Prescriptive Analytics Can Reshape Fracking in Oil and Gas Fields|journal= Data-Informed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can help with both locating and producing hydrocarbons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Basu, Atanu |title= How Data Analytics Can Help Frackers Find Oil |journal= Datanami|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by taking in seismic data, well log data, production data, and other related data sets to prescribe specific recipes for how and where to drill, complete, and produce wells in order to optimize recovery, minimize cost, and reduce environmental footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mohan, Daniel |title= Machines Prescribing Recipes from 'Things,' Earth, and People |journal =Oil &amp; Gas Investor|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconventional Resource Development===

[[File:Varied datasets.png|thumb|right|450px|Examples of structured and unstructured data sets generated and by the oil and gas companies and their ecosystem of service providers that can be analyzed together using Prescriptive Analytics software]]With the value of the end product determined by global commodity economics, the basis of competition for operators in upstream E&amp;P is the ability to effectively deploy capital to locate and extract resources more efficiently, effectively, predictably, and safely than their peers.  In unconventional resource plays, operational efficiency and effectiveness is diminished by reservoir inconsistencies, and decision-making impaired by high degrees of uncertainty.   These challenges manifest themselves in the form of low recovery factors and wide performance variations.

Prescriptive Analytics software can accurately predict production and prescribe optimal configurations of controllable drilling, completion, and production variables by modeling numerous internal and external variables simultaneously, regardless of source, structure, size, or format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Basu, Mohan, Marshall, &amp; McColpin |title=The Journey to Designer Wells |journal=Oil &amp; Gas Investor |date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option so the operations managers can proactively take appropriate actions, on time, to guarantee future exploration and production performance, and maximize the economic value of assets at every point over the course of their serviceable lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mohan, Daniel |title=Your Data Already Know What You Don't |journal=E&amp;P Magazine |date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oilfield Equipment Maintenance===

In the realm of oilfield equipment maintenance, Prescriptive Analytics can optimize configuration, anticipate and prevent unplanned downtime, optimize field scheduling, and improve maintenance planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Presley, Jennifer |title=ESP for ESPs |journal=Exploration &amp; Production |date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to General Electric, there are more than 130,000 electric submersible pumps (ESP's) installed globally, accounting for 60% of the world's oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/electric_submersible_pumping_systems/}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prescriptive Analytics has been deployed to predict when and why an ESP will fail, and recommend the necessary actions to prevent the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wheatley, Malcolm |title=Underground Analytics |journal=DataInformed |date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[Health, Safety and Environment|Health, Safety, and Environment]], prescriptive analytics can predict and preempt incidents that can lead to reputational and financial loss for oil and gas companies.

===Pricing===

Pricing is another area of focus. [[Natural gas prices]] fluctuate dramatically depending upon supply, demand, [[econometrics]], [[geopolitics]], and weather conditions. Gas producers, pipeline transmission companies and [[Utility companies|utility firms]] have a keen interest in more accurately predicting gas prices so that they can lock in favorable terms while hedging downside risk. Prescriptive analytics software can accurately predict prices by modeling internal and external variables simultaneously and also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Watson, Michael|title=Advanced Analytics in Supply Chain - What is it, and is it Better than Non-Advanced Analytics?|journal=Supply Chain Digest|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in healthcare==

Multiple factors are driving [[healthcare]] providers to dramatically improve business processes and operations as the [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] industry embarks on the necessary migration from a largely fee-for service, volume-based system to a fee-for-performance, value-based system. Prescriptive analytics is playing a key role to help improve the performance in a number of areas involving various stakeholders: payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies.

Prescriptive analytics can help providers improve effectiveness of their clinical care delivery to the population they manage and in the process achieve better patient satisfaction and retention.  Providers can do better population health management by identifying appropriate intervention models for risk stratified population combining data from the in-facility care episodes and home based telehealth.&lt;!-- It's unclear how the definition of prescriptive analytics provides distinguishes itself from the well established area of EBM (evidence based medicine) --&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can also benefit healthcare providers in their capacity planning by using analytics to leverage operational and usage data combined with data of external factors such as economic data, population demographic trends and population health trends, to more accurately plan for future capital investments such as new facilities and equipment utilization as well as understand the trade-offs between adding additional beds and expanding an existing facility versus building a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster, Roger|title=Big data and public health, part 2: Reducing Unwarranted Services|journal=Government Health IT|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can help pharmaceutical companies to expedite their drug development by identifying patient cohorts that are most suitable for the clinical trials worldwide - patients who are expected to be compliant and will not drop out of the trial due to complications.  Analytics can tell companies how much time and money they can save if they choose one patient cohort in a specific country vs. another.

In provider-payer negotiations, [[Health care provider|providers]] can improve their negotiating position with health insurers by developing a robust understanding of future service utilization. By accurately predicting utilization, providers can also better allocate personnel.

{{Other people|Richard Andvord}}
'''Richard Andvord''' (18 January 1920 – 3 February 1997) was a Norwegian businessperson and resistance member.

==Career==
Before [[World War II]] he worked in the family company [[Rich. Andvord]] in [[Oslo]],&lt;ref name=resist&gt;{{cite news|title=Brukte papir som våpen|last=Høiland|first=Terje|authorlink=Terje Høiland|date=21 June 1990|work=Aftenposten|page=10|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Richard Andvord]] in 1865. The company dealt with paper and other writing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Richard Andvord|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Arne|last=Bonde|authorlink=Arne Bonde|volume=|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Richard_Andvord/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], he participated in [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance]] work. In the [[storey#Numbering|fourth floor]] of the company building near [[Stortorvet]], false ID cards and travel licences were manufactured. Because of a far-reaching network of contacts, the counterfeiters managed to keep up with the authorities' constant change of paper quality, [[watermark]]s, etc. There was also a secret weapons stash on the sixth floor.&lt;ref name=resist/&gt; In part, the weapons were brought by Andvord from the [[Gudbrandsdal]] valley, several hours north of Oslo, where they had been secretly paradropped.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Andvord (obituary)|last1=Blidensol|first1=Ivar|last2=Michelet|first2=Chr. F.|date=13 February 1997|work=Aftenposten|page=17|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on 31 March 1942 for working with an [[Underground media in German-occupied Europe|illegal newspaper]]. He was incarcerated in [[Møllergata 19]] until 24 April 1942, then in [[Grini concentration camp]] until 19 January 1943.&lt;ref name=grini&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk fangeleksikon. Grinifangene|editor=Giertsen, Børre R.|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|year=1946|page=103|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed the resistance work afterwards.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Andvord also participated in various sabotage missions, blowing up fuel depots, workshops, offices and archives. He was often teamed with well-known saboteur [[Per Røed]],&lt;ref name=resist/&gt; in the group [[Aks 13000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Milorg D13 i kamp. Fra det hemmelige militære motstandsarbeidet i Oslo og omegn 1940–1945|editor=[[Odd Øyen|Øyen, Odd]]|publisher=Orion|location=Oslo|year=2007|edition=2nd|page=96|isbn=978-82-458-0839-1|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andvord saved Røed's life at least once, during a failed assault on the police station in ''Rådhusgata''.&lt;ref&gt;Øyen, ed, 2007: p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; In all, the group was responsible for fourteen liquidations of Nazis and collaborators.&lt;ref name=resist/&gt;

===Post-war career===
In 1958 he took over the family company.&lt;ref name=obit-haver&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Andvord (obituary)|last=Haver|first=Knut|date=13 February 1997|work=Aftenposten|page=17|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 125-year anniversary and his personal 70-year anniversary both took place in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Torvjubilanten|last=Høiland|first=Terje|date=5 May 1990|work=Aftenposten Aften|page=52|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the board of the [[Norwegian Wholesale Paper Merchants Association]] from 1951 to 1970, and chairman from 1968 to 1971. In 1980 he received honorary membership. He was also a board member of [[Kreditkassen]],&lt;ref name=obit-haver/&gt; and a member of the [[gentlemen's club]] [[Det Norske Selskab (1818)|Det Norske Selskab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norske Selskab – en virkelig herreklubb|last1=Hamre|first1=Astrid|last2=Norland|first2=Cecilie|date=20 April 1991|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=20|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
He died in February 1997,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and was buried at [[Vår Frelsers gravlund]] in a family grave; other family members resting there include [[Richard Andvord]] (1839–1913) and [[Richard Andvord (born 1886)|Richard Andvord]] (1886–1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|21003244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family company still exists, although it was merged with [[C.

'''Robert Gumede''' (born 9 August 1963) is a South African businessman and philanthropist.  He is the founder of the IT firm Gijima Technologies and its holding company  [[Gijima Group]].&lt;ref name="afs"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?lang=en&amp;id=582 |title=African Success : Biography of  Robert MATANA GUMEDE |last=www.lesideesnet.com |first=Les Idées Net - |website=www.africansuccess.org |access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2010-11-05-who-is-robert-gumede |title=Who is Robert Gumede? |last=Sole |first=Adriaan Basson, Sam |date=5 November 2010 |website=The M&amp;G Online |access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Gumede was one of seven children raised by his mother and grandmother in the town of [[Nelspruit]], South Africa.&lt;ref name="afs" /&gt; He worked at as golf caddie, gardener and a petrol attendant to help support his family in his youth. He went on to study law at the [[University of Zululand]], graduating in 1986 with a [[diploma]] in law.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;  After graduating he worked as a clerk and prosecutor at the [[Kabokweni]] Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbs"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/07/01/the-black-knight-of-africa-how-robert-gumede-is-expanding-his-legacy-across-the-continent/#675cd92e4951 |title=The Black Knight Of Africa:  How Robert Gumede is Expanding His Legacy Across the Continent |last=Nsehe |first=Mfonobong |website=Forbes |access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gumede was employed by the Ministry of Justice for a time before leaving that position in 1988.&lt;ref name="afs" /&gt;

==Business career==
In 1988 Gumede left his job with the  Ministry of Justice due to his political activities during [[apartheid]], starting his business career when he founded Gijima Electronic And Security Systems.&lt;ref name="forbs" /&gt; Gumede's worked as a business consultant after moving to Johannesburg in 1992.  This led him to identify a number of business opportunities and by the mid-1990s he had registered a number of companies with the name ''Gijima'' ranging from a firm that provided protection services to the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) led Mpumalanga government&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt; to a [[Office stationary|stationary]] company.&lt;ref name="afs" /&gt;  Gumede's most successful venture was the IT company he setup in 1997 that successfully received government tenders to develop and deploy IT solutions for the [[Department of Justice and Correctional Services]] services and the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]].  The IT company was consolidated in 2002 into Gijima Afrika Smart Technologies (GijimaASTP) which went on to win additional tenders from the government owned telecoms monopoly [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] to produce phonecards.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;

In 2011 Gumede's company GijimaAST settled out of court with the Department of Home Affairs after a dispute over a tender project worth R2.3bn due to escalating project costs.&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/siu-r360m-it-tender-was-rigged-1797803 |title=SIU: R360m IT tender was rigged | publisher = IOL News |last=Magome |first=Mogomotsi |date=21 December 2014 |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2014 the Special Investigating Unit of South Africa concluded that a R360 million tender by the [[Department of Rural Development and Land Reform]], and the State Information Technology Agency awarded to GijimaAST was irregular.&lt;ref name="iol" /&gt;  Reports by the [[Sunday Independent (South Africa)|Sunday Independent newspaper]] about the alleged non-delivery on a government tender by GijimaAST resulted in Gumede threatening to file a R1 billion defamation lawsuit against the publication.&lt;ref name="iol" /&gt;

'''Small businesses''' are privately owned [[corporation]]s, [[partnership]]s, or [[sole proprietorship]]s that have fewer employees and/or less annual revenue than a regular-sized business or corporation. Businesses are defined as "small" in terms of being able to apply for government support and qualify for preferential tax policy varies depending on the country and industry. Small businesses range from fifteen employees under the [[Australia]]n ''[[Fair Work Australia|Fair Work Act 2009]]'', fifty employees according to the definition used by the [[European Union]], and fewer than five hundred employees to qualify for many U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] programs. While small businesses can also be classified according to other methods, such as annual revenues, shipments, sales, assets, or by annual gross or net revenue or net profits, the number of employees is one of the most widely used measures.

Small businesses in many countries include service or [[retail]] operations such as [[convenience store]]s, small [[grocery store]]s, [[bakery|bakeries]] or [[delicatessen]]s, [[cosmetologist|hairdressers]] or [[tradesman|tradespeople]] (e.g., [[carpenter]]s, [[electrician]]s), [[restaurant]]s, [[motel|guest houses]], [[photographer]]s, very small-scale [[manufacturing]], and Internet-related businesses such as [[web design]] and [[computer programming]]. Some professionals operate as small businesses, such as [[lawyer]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[dentist]]s and [[medical doctor]]s (although these professionals can also work for large organizations or companies). Small businesses vary a great deal in terms of size, revenues and regulatory authorization, both within a country and from country to country. Some small businesses, such as a home accounting business, may only require a business license. On the other hand, other small businesses, such as [[day care]]s, [[retirement home]]s and [[restaurant]]s serving liquor are more heavily regulated, and may require inspection and certification from various government authorities.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Centro de Sao Paulo.jpg|thumb|Small businesses in the [[Central Zone of São Paulo]].]]

Researchers and analysts of small or owner-managed businesses generally behave as if nominal organizational forms (e.g., partnership, sole-trader, or corporation), and the consequent legal and accounting boundaries of owner-managed firms are consistently meaningful. However, owner-managers often do not delineate their behavior to accord with the implied separation between their personal and business interests. Lenders also often contract around organizational (corporate) boundaries by seeking personal guarantees or accepting privately held assets as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01531920|title=The irrelevance of organisational boundaries of owner-managed firms|first=Gregory E. P.|last=Shailer|date=1 September 1993|publisher=|journal=Small Bus Econ|volume=5|issue=3|pages=229–237|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF01531920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this behavior, researchers and analysts may wish to be cautious in the way they assess the organizational types and implied boundaries in contexts relating to owner-managed firms. These include analyses that use traditional accounting disclosures, and studies that view the firm as defined by some formal organizational structure.

===Concepts of small business, self-employment, entreprneurship, and startup===
[[File:Genova-Portici di Sottoripa.jpg|thumb|Portici di Sottoripa, [[Genova]], [[Italy]] Galleries tend to form clusters of small business owners over time.]]

The concepts of small business, [[self-employment]], [[entrepreneurship]], and [[startup]] overlap to certain degree but also carry important distinctions. 
These four concepts often conflated with each other. 

Below are the key differences of these concepts in summary:
* [[self-employment]]: an organization created with the primarily intention to give a job to the founders, i.e. sole proprietor operations.
* [[entrepreneurship]]: all new organizations.
* [[startup]]: a temporary new organization created with the intention to be bigger (at least have employees).
* small business: an organization that is small (few employees) and may or may not have the intention to be bigger.

From the summaries, we can see that many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner, but small businesses can have a small number of employees. When big firms start out, they are known as startups, but not all small businesses are startups that aim to become bigger. 
Many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service, and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, startups aim for growth and often offer an innovative product, process or service, and the entrepreneurs of startups typically aim to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales, and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[angel investor|angel investment]]s. Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ondernemerstest.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ICSBv5.pdf|first1=Martyn P. |last1=Driessen |first2=Peter S. |last2=Zwart|title=The role of the entrepreneur in small business success: the Entrepreneurship Scan|year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectacular success stories stem from startups that expanded in growth. Examples would be Microsoft, Genentech, and Federal Express which all embody the sense of new venture creation on small business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-08-01|title=The economics of small business finance: The roles of private equity and debt markets in the financial growth cycle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426698000387|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|language=en|volume=22|issue=6-8|pages=613–673|doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7|issn=0378-4266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-employment provides works primarily for the founders. Entrepreneurship refers all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to grow big or become registered, but startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow beyond the founders, to have employees, and grow large.

=== Size definitions ===
The legal definition of "small business" varies by country and by industry. In addition to number of employees, methods used to classify small companies include annual [[sales]] (turnover), value of [[assets]] and [[net profit]] (balance sheet), alone or as a combination of factors.

*In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] establishes small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis, but generally specifies a small business as having fewer than 500 employees for manufacturing businesses and less than $7.5 million in annual receipts for most non-manufacturing businesses.&lt;ref name="SBA Size"&gt;Small Business Administration. [http://www.sba.gov/content/summary-size-standards-industry Summary of Size]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dilger|first1=Robert Jay|title=Small Business Size Standards: A Historical Analysis of Contemporary Issues|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40860.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition can vary by circumstance—for example, a small business having fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees with average annual wages below $50,000 qualifies for a [[SHOP tax credit|tax credit]] under the health care reform bill [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=223666,00.html Small Business Health Care Tax Credit for Small Employers]. IRS.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a '''medium-sized business''' or '''mid-sized business''' has fewer than 500 employees.
*The [[European Union]] generally defines a small business as one that has fewer than fifty employees and either turnover or balance sheet less than €10 m.&lt;ref name=what&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en What is an SME?] accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but the European Commission is undertaking a review of this definition.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs [http://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2017-2868537_en Revision of the EU SME Definition: Inception Impact Assessment], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a '''medium-sized business''' has fewer than 250 employees and either turnover less than €50 m. or balance sheet less than €43 m.&lt;ref name=what /&gt;
*In [[Australia]], a small business is defined by the ''[[Fair Work Australia|Fair Work Act 2009]]'' as one with fewer than fifteen employees. By comparison, a '''medium-sized business''' or '''mid-sized business''' has fewer than two hundred employees.
*In [[South Africa]], the National Small Business Amendment Act (Act 26 of 2003) defines businesses in a variety of ways using five categories previously established by the National Small Business Act (Act 102 of 1996), namely, standard industrial sector and subsector classification, size of class, equivalent of paid employees, turnover and asset value excluding fixed property.&lt;ref&gt;Banking Association South Africa, [http://www.banking.org.za/what-we-do/sme/sme-definition Small Business Definition], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Small businesses are usually not dominant in their field of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Businesses joined by Facebook|url=http://stevekaplandigital.com/facebook-joining-the-ranks-of-small-business-week/|accessdate=13 May 2014|year=2014|publisher=Steve Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===
In 2016 a study that examined the demographic of small business owners was published. The study showed that the median American small business owners were above the age of 50. The ages were distributed as: 51% over 50 years old, 33% between the ages 35–49, and 16% being under the age of 35. As for sex: 55% were owned by males, 36% by females, and 9% being equal ownership of both males and females. As for race: 72% were white/Caucasian, 13.5% were Latinos, 6.3% were African American, 6.2% were Asian, and 2% as other. As for educational background: 39% had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher, 33% had some college background, and 28% received at least a high school diploma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smallbizlabs.com/2016/06/the-demographics-of-small-business-owners.html|title=The Surprising Demographics of Small Business Owners|website=Small Business Labs|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States census data for the years 2014 and 2015 shows the women's ownership share of small businesses by firm size. The data explains percentages owned by women along with the number of employees including the owner. Generally, the smaller the business, the more likely to be owned by a woman.  The data shows that about 22% of small businesses with 100-500 employees were owned by women, a percentage that rises the smaller the business.  41% of businesses with just 2-4 employees were run by women, and in businesses with just one person, that person was a woman 51% of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Franchise businesses===
[[Franchising]] is a way for small business owners to benefit from the economies of scale of the big corporation (franchiser). [[McDonald's]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] are examples of a franchise. The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable. However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the "worst of both worlds" feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. It is an assumption that small business are just franchisees, but the truth is many franchisers are also small businesses, Although considered to be a successful way of doing business, literature has proved that there is a high failure rate in franchising as well, especially in UK, where research indicates that out of 1658 franchising companies operating in 1984, only 601 remained in 1998, a mere 36%.&lt;ref&gt;*Healeas, S. Purdy, D. Stanworth, C. Watson, A.2004. Franchising as small business growth strategy: A resource based view organisational development : International small business journal,22(6), pp 539-599

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retailers' cooperative===
A [[retailers' cooperative]] is a type of cooperative which employs [[economies of scale]] on behalf of its retailer members. Retailers' cooperatives use their purchasing power to acquire discounts from manufacturers and often share marketing expenses. They are often recognized as "local groups" because they own their own stores within the community.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncdc.unl.edu/typescooperatives.shtml|title=Types of Cooperatives {{!}} Nebraska Cooperative Development Center|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=ncdc.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies to participate in retailers' cooperatives. [[Ace Hardware]], [[True Value]], and [[National Automotive Parts Association|NAPA]] are examples of a retailers' cooperative. Retail cooperatives also allow consumers to supply their own earnings and gain bargaining power outside of the business sector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Retail cooperatives mainly reside within small communities where local businesses are often shut down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Advantages==
[[File:BursaMercatiVerde.jpg|thumb|Small business in [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]]. One of the claimed advantages of small business owners is the ability to serve [[market niche]]s not served by [[mass production]] industries. Consider how few major corporations would be willing to deal the risks and uncertainty that small antique store deals with: buying and selling non-standardized items and making quick assessments of the value of rare items.]]

Many small businesses can be started at a low cost and on a part-time basis, while a person continues a regular job with an employer or provides care for family members in the home. In developing countries, many small businesses are sole-proprietor operations such as selling produce at a market stall or preparing hot food to sell on the street, that provide a small income. In the 2000s, a small business is also well suited to [[Internet]] [[marketing]]; because, it can easily serve specialized niches, something that would have been more difficult prior to the Internet revolution which began in the late 1990s. Internet marketing gives small businesses the ability to market with smaller budgets. Adapting to change is crucial in business and particularly small business; not being tied to the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] inertia associated with large corporations, small businesses can respond to changing marketplace demand more quickly. Small business proprietors tend to be in closer personal contact with their customers and clients than large corporations, as small business owners see their customers in person each week.

One study showed that small, local businesses are better for a local economy than the introduction of new chain stores. By opening up new national level chain stores, the profits of locally owned businesses greatly decrease and many businesses end up failing and having to close. This creates an exponential effect. When one store closes, people lose their jobs, other businesses lose business from the failed business, and so on. In many cases, large firms displace just as many jobs as they create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Murray | first2 = M.N. | year = 2004 | title = Do Economic Effects Justify the Use of Fiscal Incentives? | url = | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 71 | issue = 1| pages = 78–92 | doi=10.2307/4135311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence is another advantage of owning a small business. A small business owner does not have to report to a supervisor or manager. In addition, many people desire to make their own decisions, take their own risks, and reap the rewards of their efforts. Small business owners possess the flexibility and freedom to making their own decisions within the constraints imposed by economic and other environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Longenecker |first= Justin G. |author2=Carlos W. Moore |author3=J. William Petty |author4=Leslie E. Palich |title= Small business management : launching and growing entrepreneurial ventures. | edition= 14th | page= 768 | publisher= [[Cengage Learning]] | oclc=191487420 | year= 2008 |isbn= 0-324-56972-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, entrepreneurs have to work for very long hours and understand that ultimately their customers are their bosses.

Several organizations in the United States also provide help for the small business sector, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed |title=Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2010-09-26 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Small businesses (often carried out by family members) adjust quicker to the changing conditions; however, they are closed to the absorption of new knowledge and employing new labor from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walczak | first1 = D. | last2 = Voss | first2 = G. | year = | title = New Possibilities of Supporting Polish SMEs within the Jeremie Initiative Managed by BGK | url = http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1144/1173 | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = 759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Small businesses often face a variety of problems, some of which are related to their size. A frequent cause of [[bankruptcy]] is [[undercapitalization|under capitalization]]. This is often a result of poor planning rather than economic conditions. It is a common "rule of thumb" that the [[entrepreneur]] should have access to a sum of money at least equal to the projected revenue for the first year of business in addition to his or her anticipated expenses. For example, if the prospective owner thinks that he or she will generate $100,000 in revenues in the first year with $150,000 in start-up expenses, then he or she should have not less than $250,000 available. Start-up expenses are often grossly underestimated adding to the burden of the business.  Failure to provide this level of funding for the company could leave the owner liable for all of the company's debt should he or she end up in bankruptcy [[court]], under the theory of [[undercapitalization|under capitalization]].

In addition to ensuring that the business has enough capital, the small business owner must also be mindful of contribution margin ([[sales]] minus [[variable cost]]s). To break even, the business must be able to reach a level of sales where the contribution margin equals [[fixed cost]]s. When they first start out, many small business owners under price their products to a point where even at their maximum capacity, it would be impossible to break even. [[Cost control]]s or price increases often resolve this problem.

In the [[United States]], some of the largest concerns of small business owners are [[insurance]] costs (such as [[Legal liability|liability]] and [[health insurance|health]]), rising [[petroleum|energy]] costs, [[tax]]es, and [[Tax#Costs of compliance|tax compliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/uploads/SBTCC_Consolidated_Web.pdf|title = Surveying Businesses on Tax Compliance Costs |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], small business owners tend to be more concerned with excessive governmental [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=098116384X|title = Small Business: The Art Of The Start |accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracting fraud has been an ongoing problem for small businesses in the [[United States]]. Small businesses are legally obligated to receive a fair portion (23 percent) of the total value of all the government's prime contracts as mandated by the Small Business Act of 1953. Since 2002, a series of federal investigations have found fraud, abuse, loopholes, and a lack of oversight in federal small business contracting, which has led to the diversion of billions of dollars in small business contracts to large corporations.

Another problem for many small businesses is termed the 'Entrepreneurial Myth' or E-Myth. The [[:wikt:mythic|mythic]] assumption is that an expert in a given technical field will also be expert at running that kind of business. Additional business management skills are needed to keep a business running smoothly. Some of this misunderstanding arises from the failure to distinguish between small business managers as entrepreneurs or capitalists. While nearly all owner-managers of small firms are obliged to assume the role of capitalist, only a minority will act as entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isb.sagepub.com/content/12/3/33.abstract Shailer, G. Capitalists and Entrepreneurs in Owner-managed Firms. ''International Small Business Journal'' 12(3) April-June 1994: 33–41].&lt;/ref&gt; The line between an owner-manager and an entrepreneur can be defined by whether or not their business is growth oriented. In general, small business owners are primarily focused on surviving rather than growing; therefore, not experiencing the five stages of the corporate life cycle (birth, growth, maturity, revival, and decline) like an entrepreneur would.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/3121621781/fmt/pi/rep/NONE?hl=&amp;cit:auth=Armstrong,%20Craig%20E&amp;cit:title=Competence%20or%20flexibility?%20Survival%20and%20growth%20implications%20of%20...&amp;cit:pub=Journal%20of%20Strategy%20and%20Management&amp;cit:vol=6&amp;cit:iss=4&amp;cit:pg=377&amp;cit:date=2013&amp;ic=true&amp;cit:prod=ABI/INFORM%20Complete&amp;_a=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&amp;_s=isTHBF+8fhiXE4YF6oLH5yZLbn0=#statusbar=1&amp;zoom=110&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem for many small businesses is the capacity of much larger businesses to influence or sometimes determine their chances for success. [[Business networking]] and [[social media]] has been used as a major tool by small businesses in the UK, but most of them just use a "scatter-gun" approach in a desperate attempt to exploit the market which is not that successful.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, A., 2013. Targeting networking and social media; how to win new business effectively. The Guardian, [online]27 November. Available at https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/nov/27/targeted-networking-social-media-business [accessed 15 March 2014]
&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of small firms lack a [[business plan]], a tool that is considered one of the most important factors for a venture's success. Business planning is associated with improved growth prospects. Funders and investors usually require a business plan. A plan also serves as a strategic planning document for owners and CEOs, which can be used as a "bible" for decision-making &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richbell | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Wardle | first2 = P. | last3 = Watts | first3 = H. D. | year = 2006 | title = Owner-managers and Business Planning in the Small Firm | url = | journal = International Small Business Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 496–514 | doi=10.1177/0266242606067275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international trade survey indicated that the British share of businesses which are exporting rose from 32% in 2012 to 39% in 2013. Although this may seem positive, in reality the growth is slow, as small business owners shy away from exporting due to actual and perceived barriers.
Learning the basics of a foreign language could be the solution to open doors to new trade markets, it is a reality that not all foreign business partners speak English. China is stated to grow by 7.6% in 2013 and still sadly 95% of business owners who want to export to China have no desire and no knowledge to learn their local language.&lt;ref name="Digital Resource"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalresource1.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/profitable-tactics-using-internet-marketing-for-small-business/|title=Profitable Tactics Using Internet Marketing For Small Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
When small business fails, the owner may file for bankruptcy. In most cases, this can be handled through a [[personal bankruptcy]] [[filing (legal)|filing]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Corporations can file bankruptcy, but if it is out of business and valuable corporate assets are likely to be repossessed by secured creditors, there is little advantage to going to the expense of a corporate bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Many states offer exemptions for small business assets so they can continue to operate during and after personal bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, corporate assets are normally not exempt; hence, it may be more difficult to continue operating an incorporated business if the owner files bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
Researchers have examined small business failures in some depth, with attempts to model the predictability of failure.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://isb.sagepub.com/content/7/4/54 Shailer, G. 1989, The Predictability of Small Enterprise Failures: Evidence and Issues, ''International Small Business Journal'', Vol.7, No. 4, July-September, pp. 54-58.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of examples is available at [http://ser.e-contentmanagement.com/archives/references/4156 ICSB].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social responsibility===
Small businesses can encounter several problems related to engaging in [[corporate social responsibility]], due to characteristics inherent in their size. Owners of small businesses often participate heavily in the day-to-day operations of their companies. This results in a lack of time for the owner to coordinate socially responsible efforts, such as supporting local charities or not-for-profit activities.&lt;ref name="Lepoutre, Jan 2006"&gt;Lepoutre, Jan, and Hoyehnusy Ezekiel "Investigating the Impact of Firm Size on Small Business Social Responsibility: A Critical Review." Journal of Business Ethics 67.3 (2006): 257-273. JSTOR. Web. 3 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a small business owner's expertise often falls outside the realm of socially responsible practices, which contributing to a lack of participation. Small businesses also face a form of [[peer pressure]] from larger forces in their respective industries, making it difficult to oppose and work against industry expectations.&lt;ref name="Lepoutre, Jan 2006"/&gt; Furthermore, small businesses undergo stress from shareholder expectations. Because small businesses have more personal relationships with their patrons and local shareholders, they must also be prepared to withstand closer scrutiny if they want to share in the benefits of committing to socially responsible practices or not.
&lt;ref name="Lepoutre, Jan 2006" /&gt;

===Job quality===
While small businesses employ over half the workforce in the US &lt;ref name="United States 2011"&gt;United States. Small Business Administration. "Frequently Asked Questions." Frequently Asked Question About Small Business. SBA Office of Advocacy, Jan. 2011. Web. 21 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been established as a main driving force behind job creation,&lt;ref name="Edmiston, Kelley 2007"&gt;Edmiston, Kelley. "The Role of Small and Large Businesses in Economic Development." Economic Review 92.2 (2007): 73-97. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of the jobs these businesses create has been called into question. Small businesses generally employ individuals from the [[Secondary labor market|Secondary labour market]]. As a result, in the U.S., wages are 49% higher for employees of large firms.&lt;ref name="Edmiston, Kelley 2007"/&gt; Additionally, many small businesses struggle or are unable to provide employees with benefits they would be given at larger firms. Research from the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] indicates that employees of large firms are 17% more likely to receive benefits including salary, paid leave, paid holidays, bonuses, insurance, and [[retirement plan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hope | first1 = John B. | last2 = Mackin | first2 = Patrick C. | year = 2007 | title = The Relationship Between Employee Turnover and Employee Compensation in Small Business | url = | journal = Small Business Research Summary | volume = 308 | issue = | pages = 1–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both lower wages and fewer benefits combine to create a job turnover rate among U.S. small businesses that is three times higher than large firms.&lt;ref name="Edmiston, Kelley 2007"/&gt; Employees of small businesses also must adapt to the higher failure rate of small firms, which means that they are more likely to lose their job due to the firm going under. In the U.S. 69% of small businesses last at least two years, but this percentage drops to 51% for firms reaching five years in operation.&lt;ref name="United States 2011"/&gt; The U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] counts companies with as much as $35.5 million in sales and 1,500 employees as "small businesses", depending on the industry. Outside government, companies with less than $7 million in sales and fewer than five hundred employees are widely considered small businesses.

=== Cyber crime ===
{{Main|Cyber crime}}

Cyber crime, in the business world can be broken down into 4 main categories. They include loss of reputation and consumer confidence, cost of fixing the issue, loss of capital and assets, and legal difficulties that can come from these problems. Loss of reputation and consumer confidence can be impacted greatly after one attack. Many small businesses will struggle to gain confidence and trust in their customers after being known for having problems prior. Cost of fixing the cyber attack would require experts outside of their field to further the investigation and find the problem. Being down for a business means losing money at the same time. This could halt the online operations and mean the business could potentially be down for a long period of time. Loss of capital and assets ties well in with the cost of fixing the issue. During a cyber attack, a business may lose their funds for that business. Worst-case scenario, a business may actually lose all their working capital and funds. The legal difficulties involved with cyber crime can become pricy and hurt the business itself for not having standard security measures and standards. Security not only for the business but more importantly the customer should be number one priority when dealing with security protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessknowhow.com/security/cybercrime.htm|title=4 Ways Cyber Crime Can Hurt Your Small Business|work=Business Know-How|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monetary dollar damage caused by cyber crime in 2016 equalled out to be over 1.33 billion dollars in the United States alone. In 2016, California alone had over 255 million dollars reported to the IC3. The average company this year in the United States amounted to 17.36 million dollars in cyber crime attacks. Certain cyber attacks can vary on how long it takes to solve a problem. It can take upwards to 69 days for an average everyday attack on a business. The types of attacks include viruses and malware issues. Employee activities within the workspace can also render a cyber attack. Employees using mobile devices or remote work access off the job makes it easier for a cyber attack to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/1731/smb-and-cyber-crime/|title=Topic: U.S. companies and cyber crime|website=www.statista.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
Although small businesses have close relationships with their existing customers, finding new customers and reaching new markets is a major challenge for small business owners. Small businesses typically find themselves strapped for time to do marketing, as they have to run the day-to-day aspects of the business. To create a continual stream of new business and find new clients and customers, they must work on marketing their business continuously. Low sales (result of poor marketing) is one of the major reasons of small business failure. Common marketing techniques for small business include [[business networking]] (e.g., attending [[Chamber of Commerce]] events or [[trade fair]]s), "[[word of mouth]]" promotion by existing customers, customer referrals, [[Yellow pages]] directories, television, radio, and outdoor ads (e.g., roadside billboards), print ads, and Internet marketing. TV ads can be quite expensive, so they are normally intended to create awareness of a product or service. Another means by which small businesses can advertise is through the use of "deal of the day" websites such as [[Groupon]] and [[Living Social]]. These Internet deals encourage customers to patronize small businesses.

[[File:Keyword-research-competition-analysis.jpg|thumb|left|Example of keyword analysis based on market competition.]]

Many small business owners find internet marketing more affordable. [[Google AdWords]] and [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]] are two popular options of getting small business products or services in front of motivated web searchers. Social media has also become an affordable route of marketing for small business. It is a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing and small businesses are able to do it themselves or find small social marketing agencies that they can hire out for a small fee. Statistically, social media marketing has a higher lead-to-close rate than traditional media.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Successful online small business marketers are also adept at utilizing the most relevant [[Index term|keywords]] in their website content. Advertising on [[Niche market|niche]] websites that are frequented by potential customers can also be effective, but with the [[long tail]] of the Internet, it can be time intensive to advertise on enough websites to garner an effective [[Reach (advertising)|reach]].

Creating a business website has become increasingly affordable with many [[do-it-yourself]] programs now available for beginners. A website can provide significant marketing exposure for small businesses when marketed through the Internet and other channels. Some popular services are [[WordPress]], [[Joomla]] [[Squarespace]], [[Wix.com|Wix]] and EXAI . [[Social media]] has proven to be very useful in gaining additional exposure for many small businesses. Many small business owners use [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] as a way to reach out to their loyal customers to give them news about specials of the day or special coupons, generate repeat business and reach out to new potential clients. The relational nature of social media, along with its immediacy and twenty-four-hour presence lend intimacy to the relationships small businesses can have with their customers, while making it more efficient for them to communicate with greater numbers. [[Facebook]] ads are also a very cost-effective way for small businesses owners to reach a targeted audience with a very specific message. In addition to the social networking sites, [[blogs]] have become a highly effective way for small businesses to position themselves as experts on issues that are important to their customers. This can be done with a proprietary [[blog]] and/or by using a back-link strategy wherein the marketer comments on other [[blogs]] and leaves a link to the small business' own website. Posting to a blog about the company's business or service area regularly can increase web traffic to a company website.

'''Marketing plan'''
* '''[[Marketing research|Market research]]''' – To produce a marketing plan for small businesses, research needs to be done on similar businesses, which should include [[Secondary research|desk research]] (done online or with directories) and [[field research]]. This gives an insight in the [[Target audience|target]] group’s behavior and shopping patterns. Analyzing the competitor’s marketing strategies makes it easier for small business to gain [[market share]].
* '''[[Marketing mix]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Dave|title=Business for Higher Awards|year=1996|publisher=Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Marketing mix is a crucial factor for any business to be successful. Especially for a small business, examining a competitor’s marketing mix can be very helpful. An appropriate market mix, which uses different types of marketing, can help to boost sales.
* '''[[Product lifecycle|Product life cycle]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kotler|first=Philip|title=Principles of Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; – After the launch of the business, crucial points of focus should be the growth phase (adding customers, adding products or services, and/or expanding to new markets) and working towards the maturity phase. Once the business reaches maturity stage, an extension strategy should be in place. Re-launching is also an option at this stage. [[Pricing strategies|Pricing strategy]] should be flexible and based on the different stages of the product life cycle.
* '''[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion techniques]]''' – It is preferable to keep promotion expenses as low as possible. ‘Word of mouth’, ‘email marketing’, ‘print-ads’ in local newspapers etc. can be effective.
* '''[[Distribution (business)|Channels of distribution]]''' – Selecting an effective channel of distribution may reduce the promotional expenses as well as overall expenses for a small business.

==Contribution to the economy==
In the US, small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) account for more than half the non-farm, private GDP and around half the private sector employment.&lt;ref name="United States 2011"/&gt; Regarding small business, the top job provider is those with fewer than ten [[employee]]s, and those with ten or more but fewer than twenty [[employee]]s comes in as the second, and those with twenty or more but fewer than one hundred [[employee]]s comes in as the third (interpolation of data from the following references).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sb_econ2001.pdf The Small Business Economy - A Report to the President: 2001 pg. 84 - Table A.3] (the last time data was granular enough for the figures for fewer than 10 employees was 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent data shows firms with fewer than twenty employees account for slightly more than 18% of the employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sb_econ2008.pdf |title=U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy: The Small Business Economy 2008, A Report to the President |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to "The Family Business Review," "There are approximately seventeen million sole-proprietorship in the US. It can be argued that a sole-proprietorship (an unincorporated business owned by a single person) is a type of family business" and "there are twenty-two million small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) in the US and approximately 14,000 big businesses." Also, it has been found that small businesses created the newest jobs in communities, "In 1979, David Birch published the first empirical evidence that small firms (fewer than 100 employees) created the most new jobs", and Edmiston claimed that "perhaps the greatest generator of interest in entrepreneurship and small business is the widely held belief that small businesses in the United States create most new jobs. The evidence suggests that small businesses indeed create a substantial majority of net new jobs in an average year." The U.S. Small Business Administration has found small businesses have created two-thirds of net new private sector jobs in the US since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Job_Creation_fact_sheet_FINAL_0.pdf |title=Small Business Facts: Small Business Job Creation Deconstructed |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local businesses provide competition to each other and also challenge corporate giants. Of the 5,369,068 employer firms in 1995, 78.8 percent had fewer than ten employees, and 99.7 percent had fewer than five hundred employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/stats/ch_em97.pdf |title=Office of Advocacy - U.S. SBA - Characteristics of Small Business Employees and Owners |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of funding==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 119152 Small businesses in Biloela, 1949.jpg|thumb|Small businesses in [[Biloela]], [[Central Queensland]], [[Australia]], 1949]]

Small businesses use various sources available for start-up [[Financial capital|capital]]:
* Self-financing by the owner through cash savings, [[Ownership equity|equity]] [[loan]] on his or her home, and or other assets
* Loans or financial gifts from friends or relatives
* Grants from private foundations, government or other sources
* Private [[stock]] issue
* Forming [[partnerships]]
* [[Angel investor]]s
* Loans from banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions
* [[SME finance]], including collateral-based lending and [[venture capital]], given sufficiently sound business venture plans

Some small businesses are further financed through [[credit card]] debt—usually a poor choice, given that the interest rate on credit cards is often several times the rate that would be paid on a [[line of credit]] at a bank or a [[bank]] [[loan]]. Recent research suggests that the use of credit scores in small business lending by community banks is surprisingly widespread. Moreover, the scores employed tend to be the consumer credit scores of the small business owners rather than the more encompassing small business credit scores that include data on the firms as well as on the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/wp0909.pdf |title=The Surprising Use of Credit Scoring in Small Business Lending by Community Banks and the Attendant Effects on Credit Availability and Risk |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many owners seek a bank loan in the name of their business; however, banks will usually insist on a personal guarantee by the business owner.

In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) runs several loan programs that may help a small business secure loans. In these programs, the SBA guarantees a portion of the loan to the issuing bank, and thus, relieves the bank of some of the risk of extending the loan to a small business. The SBA also requires business owners to pledge personal assets and sign as a personal guarantee for the loan. The [[8(a) Business Development Program]] assists in the development of small businesses owned and operated by [[African American]]s, Hispanics, and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business-development-0 8(a) Business Development]". SBA.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian small businesses can take advantage of federally funded programs and services. See [[Federal financing for small businesses in Canada (grants and loans)]].

On October 2010, [[Alejandro Cremades]] and Tanya Prive founded the first equity [[crowdfunding]] platform&lt;ref name="Equity Crowdfunding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equitycrowdfunding.net|title=Equity Crowdfunding|work=Equity Crowdfunding |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for small businesses in history as an alternative source of financing. The platform operates under the name of Rock The Post.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/crowdfunding-comes-to-small-businesses-2012-6|title=Crowdfunding comes to small businesses|work=Business Insider |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business networks and advocacy groups==
Small businesses often join or come together to form organizations to advocate for their causes or to achieve [[economies of scale]] that larger businesses benefit from, such as the opportunity to buy cheaper [[health insurance]] in bulk. These organizations include local or regional groups such as [[Chambers of Commerce]] and [[independent business alliances]], as well as national or international industry-specific organizations. Such groups often serve a dual purpose, as [[business network]]s to provide marketing and connect members to potential sales leads and suppliers, and also as advocacy groups, bringing together many small businesses to provide a stronger voice in regional or national [[politics]]. In the case of independent business alliances, promoting the value of locally owned, independent business (not necessarily small) through public education campaigns is integral to their work.

The largest regional small business group in the [[United States]] is the [[Council of Smaller Enterprises]], located in [[Greater Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STEVE LOHR Special to The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/01/15/archives/smallbusiness-forces-unite-meeting-drafts-proposals-for-carter.html |title=Steve Lohr, "Small-Business Forces Unite; Meeting Drafts Proposals For Carter Memories of Earlier Gatherings Small-Business Forces Unite", ''The New York Times'', Special, Jan. 15, 1980, Business &amp; Finance, Page D1 |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=1980-01-15 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
United Kingdom trade and Investment (www.ukti.gov.in) gives out research in different markets around the world, also research in program planning and promotional activities to exporters. The BEXA (British Exporters Association) role is to connect new exporters to expert services, it can provide details about regional export contacts, who could be made informally to discuss issues. Trade associations and all major banks could often provide links to international groups in foreign markets, some could also help set up joint venture, trade fairs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Senior|first=Norah|title=Small businesses need to see exporting as a viable option and 'think global'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/nov/18/why-small-businesses-should-export|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of youth organizations, including [[4-H]], [[Junior Achievement]], and [[Scouting]] have special interactive programs and training to help young people run their own small business under adult supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide], 22 Jun 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1144">A '''strategic bankruptcy''' may occur when an otherwise solvent company makes use of the [[bankruptcy|bankruptcy laws]] for some specific business purpose.&lt;ref&gt;See Kevin J. Delaney, Strategic Bankruptcy (University of California Press, 1998) for a discussion of this phenomenon by reference to particular cases.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2002 [[Kmart]] filed [[Chapter 11]] for protection from creditors. One of the main problems affecting Kmart's cash flow and therefore its liquidity was that Kmart was locked into long-term leases at premium rates with respect to various unprofitable stores. While in chapter 11 reorganization, Kmart was able to renegotiate or rescind those particular leases.

In some countries, like Sweden, it is common at least for smaller companies with deep debts, to have a bankruptcy, and close down the company, but where the owner has prepared a new company which buys important assets including the name, and continues with much smaller debts.

A '''term loan''' is a monetary [[loan]] that is repaid in regular payments over a set period of time. Term loans usually last between one and ten years, but may last as long as 30 years in some cases. A term loan usually involves an unfixed [[interest rate]] that will add additional balance to be repaid.

==Usage==
Term loans can be given on an individual basis, but are often used for [[small business]] loans. The ability to repay over a long period of time is attractive for new or expanding enterprises, as the assumption is that they will increase their [[profit (accounting)|profit]] over time. Term loans are a good way of quickly increasing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] in order to raise a business’ supply capabilities or range. For instance, some new companies may use a term loan to buy company vehicles or rent more space for their operations.

===Considerations===
One thing to consider when getting a term loan is whether the interest rate is [[Fixed interest rate loan|fixed]] or [[Floating interest rate|floating]]. A fixed interest rate means that the percentage of interest will never increase, regardless of the financial market. Low-interest periods are usually an excellent time to take out a fixed rate loan. Floating interest rates will fluctuate with the market, which can be good or bad  for you depending on what happens with the global and national economy. Since some term loans last for 10 years, betting that the rate will stay consistently low is a real risk.

Also, consider whether the term loan you are looking at uses [[compound interest]]. If it does, the amount of interest will be periodically added to the [[Principal sum|principal]] borrowed amount, meaning that the interest keeps getting higher the longer the term lasts. If the loan does use compound interest, check to see if there are any penalties for early repayment of the loan. If you get a [[windfall gain|windfall]] or profits increase spectacularly, you may be able to pay off your entire balance before it is due, preventing you from paying additional interest by waiting for the loan term to end.

Some loaning institutions offer a variety of repayment plans for your term loan. Commonly, you may choose to pay off your debt in even amounts, or the amount you pay will gradually increase over the loan period. If you expect that you will be more financially able to repay in the future, causing an incremental increase may help you and save you interest. If you are unsure of your future monetary position, even payments may help prevent [[Default (finance)|defaulting]] on the loan if things go badly.

Choosing a term loan may be in your best interest, depending on your circumstances. Beware of extremely long repayment periods, as generally speaking, the longer the term, the more you will owe because the interest accrues over a long period of time. For more information, contact a [[financial advisor]] or speak to your bank about loan options they provide.

The '''W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus''' is an [[business park|office park]] in western [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]] that houses sixteen [[Government of New York (state)|New York State Government]] office buildings. The land totals roughly {{convert|330|acre|ha}} and over 3 million square feet (280,000 m²) of office space,&lt;ref name=Dirt/&gt; and about 7,000 state employees work there.&lt;ref name=Plan&gt;{{cite news | title = Questioning Grand Plan's Legacy | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6306289 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210211/http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6306289 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-07-23 | author = Benjamin, Elizabeth | page = A1 | date = 2005-11-05 | accessdate = 2010-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus was built during the 1950s and 1960s&lt;ref name=Dirt/&gt; in a suburban, car-oriented style bordered by an outer [[Beltway|ring road]] that cuts the campus off from the surrounding neighborhoods. The campus is flanked by [[Streets of Albany, New York#Washington Avenue|Washington Avenue]] to the north, Western Avenue to the south, [[SUNY Albany|University at Albany]] to the west, and [[New York State Route 85]] to the east. With its own steam generation power plant  for cooling and heating (Building 17) the campus is mostly self-sufficient.&lt;ref name=Dirt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment Parcel E-2: Harriman State Office Campus | date = 2008-05-28 | publisher = New York State Office of General Services | author = Chazen Environmental Services, Inc. | accessdate = 2010-07-04 | url = http://www.esd.ny.gov/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/ParcelE-2ESA-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The campus was planned in the 1950s by [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[W. Averell Harriman]] to offer more parking and easier access for state employees.&lt;ref name=Dirt/&gt; Prior to this the land was part of the [[Albany Pine Bush]] with the Albany Municipal Golf Course to the west where the University at Albany is today.&lt;ref name=Dirt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Phase I Archaeological Survey Harriman State Office Campus | author = The Louis Berger Group, Inc. | accessdate = 2010-07-06 | date = September 2008 | publisher = The Chazen Companies | url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/HarrimanArcheologicalAssesment.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211321/http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/HarrimanArcheologicalAssesment.pdf | archive-date = 2012-03-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first building (Building 1, Department of Civil Service) was built in 1956, and 2, 9, and 17 were completed by the early 1960s, but most of the buildings were built in the mid-late 1960s under Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]].&lt;ref name=Dirt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/ParcelAESA-1.pdf | title = Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Parcel A: Harriman State Office Campus | publisher = New York State Office of General Services | author = Chazen Environmental Services, Inc. | accessdate = 2010-07-04 | date = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964  the Division Headquarters Building (Building 22) of the [[New York State Police]] was built in the campus, marking the first time that the administrative and headquarters support services were consolidated in the same building. Three years later the State Police Academy (Building 24) was built next door.&lt;ref name=Police&gt;{{cite web | title = NYSP History: 1960s | publisher = State of New York | url = http://www.troopers.ny.gov/Introduction/History/1960s/ | accessdate = 2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Police Forensics Center (Building 30), was built in 1994.&lt;ref name=Dirt&gt;{{cite news |title=Dirt, Not Ivy, Covers This Campus |page=A1 |last=McGuire |first=Mark |date=1997-09-28 |accessdate=2010-05-22 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5831612 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430030126/http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5831612 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-04-30 |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 less than {{convert|2|acre|ha}} on Brevator Street was given at no charge to the city of Albany for use of a new fire station, Engine 10. This increased coverage for the western part of the city, including the Harriman Campus and University at Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5425414 | title = State May Give Albany Land for New Fire Station | page = 4A | date = 1987-07-10 | accessdate = 2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with Governor [[Hugh Carey]] in the 1970s, policy has been to relocate workers from the Harriman Campus and other suburban settings to the various downtowns of the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]]; Albany, [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and [[Troy, New York|Troy]]. The plan continued under governors [[Mario Cuomo]] and [[George Pataki]]; Pataki signed into law in 1998 the $235 million ''Albany Plan'' that further sped up the process and included privatizing the campus after moving the majority of state workers to other locations. From 1995 to 2005 over 13,364 state workers were relocated around the Capital District, including moving the 1,400 [[New York State Department of Transportation]] workers from the Harriman Campus to a renovated 50 Wolf Road in [[Colonie (village), New York|Colonie]] (the former [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] headquarters).&lt;ref name=Plan/&gt;

The Harriman Research and Technology Development Corporation (HRTDC) was established in 2004 as a subsidiary of the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] and has been tasked with the redevelopment of the campus.&lt;ref name=HRTDC&gt;{{cite web | title = Harriman Research and Technology Development Corporation (HRTDC) | accessdate = 2010-07-03 | url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/HRTDC.html | publisher = State of New York/Empire State Development Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web | title = History and Description of the Harriman Campus | url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/HRTDCCampusHistory.pdf | accessdate = 2010-07-05 | publisher = State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was originally envisioned in 2003 as a bold move to completely eliminate the ring road, demolish the existing buildings, and construct a hotel, commercial, residential, and high tech office space all integrated with the surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; The Harriman Campus once included land north of Washington Avenue and south of [[Interstate 90]]. In 2006 Columbia Development purchased {{convert|12.6|acres|ha|abbr=on}} of surface-parking north of Washington Ave for $4.2 million to add to its growing Patroon Creek Corporate Center. Buildings 1 and 1a were slated to be demolished in 2006 as part of that Albany Plan, funded with the proceeds from the parking lot sale to Columbia Development.&lt;ref name=Raze&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | title = State Ready to Raze Harriman Buildings | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6409407 | page = E1 | date =  2006-08-18 | accessdate = 2010-07-04 | author = Larry Rulison}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the buildings have been demolished.

That far-reaching plan, however, was scrapped by Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]] in 2007. Two very different proposals were put forth, one by the Howard Group that kept to the original idea of integration, retail, and residential space and demolition of existing structures, the other by Columbia Development. Columbia Development's proposal, which would keep the state office buildings and privatize the land putting it back on the tax rolls piecemeal as tenants were lined up, was the one chose by the HRTDC. Residential development would take a smaller role as would retail. The ring road would also stay unless land requirements would require moving it, but not until tenants were definitely lined up for space. The campus would remain apart and segregated from the surrounding neighborhoods. Columbia Development will begin with just a five to {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel in the northwest corner of the campus and has a one-year window starting in 2010 to market it for development.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite news | title = State Plan's New Look | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=9369048 | author = Churchill, Chris | page = C1 | date = 2010-01-29 | accessdate = 2010-07-03 | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighboring University at Albany has petitioned for a transfer of {{convert|3.3|acre|ha|abbr=on}} from the Harriman Campus to the university in order to build a new [[dormitory]], and the HRTDC agreed to the transfer. This has taken place; it was under the purview of the Office of General Services (OGS), the state agency that acts as landlord for state-owned property, since the former OGS Commissioner John Egan was also the chairman of the HRTDC this was not likely to be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = UAlbany Dorm Options Limited | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=9268187 | date = 2010-01-14 | author = Carleo-Evangelist, Jordan | page = D5 | accessdate = 2010-07-04 | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans to relocate state workers and privatize the campus have seen a further reversal as time has passed. Recently 200 employees of the Office of Real Property Services have been moved from downtown Albany to the campus, as well as plans for a new 3-story building to house a laboratory for 50 workers of the Department of Agriculture. Preliminary plans also call for a $100 million data center for the Department of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Late Budget Pushes Back Harriman Project | publisher = Hearst Corporation | work = Times Union (Albany) | accessdate = 2010-08-20 | date = 2010-08-19 | url = http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Late-budget-pushes-back-Harriman-project-621539.php | author = Churchill, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture and Markets, the new Building # 6, is complete and occupied. Further, in 2015, the Office of General Services' Business Services Center moved into a renovated Building 5.

In July 2016, New York State released a Request for Proposals for a 27-acre part of the Harriman Campus for sale to private investment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/State-ready-to-part-with-a-chunk-of-Harriman-8355848.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harriman Business Center Incubator===
The Harriman Business Center is a [[business incubator]] in Building 7A at the campus. The University at Albany's Small Business Development Center has an office on-site to provide consulting, training, and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harriman Business Center Building 7A | publisher = Harriman Research and Technology Park | accessdate = 2010-07-04 | url = http://www.esd.ny.gov/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/HarrimanBusinessCenterBuilding7-A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University also has its College of Computing and Information at the incubator. Other tenants are the New School of Radio and Television, Petrolab (a division of [[Ametek]]), Applied Visions, Inc., and Breonics (a [[bio-medical]] research firm)0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HRTDC Business Center | publisher = Empire State Development Corporation | url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/BusinessCenter.html | accessdate = 2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Need to verify those private companies still occupy Building 7A. --&gt;

===State Emergency Management Office===
Below the Harriman Campus is a two-story [[underground bunker]] designed to withstand a [[nuclear attack]], adjacent to the State Police Headquarters. This bunker was built over 40 years ago to assure continuation of the government of the state of New York in case of an emergency during the [[Cold War]]. As originally built it was to accommodate 400 people for up to two weeks, during the late 1990s it received a $1 million renovation to house the State Emergency Management Office (SEMO) in response to concerns over the [[Y2K bug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | accessdate = 2010-07-06 | date = 2000-01-01 | page = A5 | author = Lyons, Brendan | title = State Sees Only Minor Glitch | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6020016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been brought to full-operation multiple times, including the following: once on January 1, 2000 to monitor the Y2K bug, then again after the [[September 11th attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | accessdate = 2010-07-06 | title = Catastrophe Tests State | author =  Odato, James and Jay Jochnowitz | date = 2001-09-12 | page = B1 | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6127270}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and again during both responses to [[Hurricane Irene]] &amp; [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)]] and [[Superstorm Sandy]]. It is a fully functional emergency management office, housing the state coordination center, or [[Emergency Operations Center (EOC)]], and manages disaster response for the State of New York, as warranted.&lt;ref&gt;Professional knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
Of the roughly {{convert|330|acre|km2}} that comprise the Harriman Campus about 155 of them (45%) is open-space; the rest is buildings, roads, sidewalks, and parking lots. Two ring roads surround the main portion of the campus. The outer road is a three lane one-way traveling counterclockwise and has thirteen access points to NY 85, I-90, Brevator Street, Western Avenue, and Washington Avenue. The inner road is a three lane one-way traveling clockwise and allows access to campus buildings and parking lots. The roads are connected by several one-way [[Texas U-turn]]s. Peak traffic counts on all six lanes of the ring road is approximately 4,000 vehicles per hour. The highest volume of traffic entering the campus ring road is from the Crosstown Arterial (NY 85).&lt;ref name=Impact&gt;{{cite web | title = Draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement Redevelopment Strategy for the Harriman State Office Campus | publisher = New York State Office of General Services | url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/Harriman2002FinalDGEIS.pdf |author = C.T. Male Associates, P.C. | date = 2007-08-27 | accessdate = 2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Capital District Transportation Authority]] (CDTA) runs public transit lines through the campus connecting it to the surrounding region. OGS runs an internal shuttle to bring employees from parking lots to buildings.&lt;ref name=Impact/&gt;

The Building 17 Campus Power Plant produces steam that is piped to all the buildings through a duct-system. It is used for heating during the winter and is used to generate chilled water for cooling from April to October. Electricity is delivered to the campus by [[National Grid plc|National Grid]].&lt;ref name=Impact/&gt;

The New York State Police Troop G serves the needs of the campus. The city of Albany's West Station supplements the state police presence as needed. Fire protection is provided by the city of Albany's Engine 10 fire station on Brevator Street.&lt;ref name=Impact/&gt;

==Activities==
The New York State Office of General Services’ Special Events Office puts on craft shows, a farmer's market, and noon-time food vendors in a central courtyard at the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vendor/Participant Directions to the Empire State Plaza &amp; Harriman State Office Campus for OGS Special Events’ shows &amp; festivals | url = http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CCE/Docs/VendorDirections.pdf | publisher = State of New York | accessdate = 2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial garden in memory of the [[September 11th attacks]] is located near Buildings 8 and 9. Unofficial activities that take place (and are not actually permitted) are jogging, bird-watching, dog-walking, and on the ring road- road races.&lt;ref name=Impact/&gt;

==Sick Building Syndrome==
In 1991, several employees of Building 8 became ill after the pesticide [[chlorpyrifos]] was misused in the building. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A '''waybill''' ([[International Union of Railways|UIC]]) is a document issued by a [[common carrier|carrier]] giving details and instructions relating to the [[shipment]] of a [[consignment]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Typically it will show the names of the [[consignor]] and [[consignee]], the point of origin of the consignment, its destination, and [[Thoroughfare|route]]. Most freight forwarders and trucking companies use an in-house waybill called a house bill. These typically contain "conditions of contract of carriage" terms on the back of the form. These terms cover limits to liability and other terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/waybill.html|title=What is a waybill? definition and meaning|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A waybill is similar to that of a courier's receipt which contains the details of the consignor and the consignee, and also the point of origin and destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.jctrans.net/jcnet/il/express/2007111542615.shtml|title=What are Courier's Receipt|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=JCtrans Technology Co., Ltd.|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air waybills==
Most airlines use a different form called an [[air waybill]] which lists additional items such as airport of destination, flight number, and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/air-waybill-AWB.html|title=What is air waybill(AWB)? definition and meaning|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sea waybills==
The UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(1) applies to: 
*[[bill of lading|bills of lading]] s.1(2), 
* sea waybills s.1(3), and 
* ships' delivery orders s.1(4), 
... whether in paper or electronic form s.1(5). 

Under s.1(3) of the Act, a sea waybill is: "any document which is not a bill of lading but is such a receipt for goods as contains a contract for the carriage of goods by sea; and identifies the person to whom delivery of the goods is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract".

s.2 continues: "...a person who becomes the person who (without being an original party to the contract of carriage) is the person to whom delivery of the goods to which a sea waybill relates is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract ... shall (by virtue of becoming the person to whom delivery is to be made) have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract of carriage".

Note: the UK's [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] does NOT apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea.

'''Yves Bouvier''' (born 8 September 1963) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[businessman]] and [[art dealer]] best known for his role in [[the Bouvier Affair]]. He was the president of Natural Le Coultre, an international company specialized in the transportation, storage, scientific analysis, and conservation of works of art, luxurious goods and other collectibles. In September 2017, it emerged that Bouvier is under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities amid allegations that he may have evaded more than 100 million euros in taxes related to his cross-border art dealings.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/yves-bouvier-swiss-tax-charges-1072205&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, meanwhile, the Geneva Prosecutor reportedly opened a new criminal investigation into Bouvier relating to an indictment on charges of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bouvier-questioned-by-geneva-prosecutor-over-russian-art-deals&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Yves Bouvier is the son of Jean-Jacques Bouvier, owner of Natural Le Coultre, a 150-year-old company specialized in moving and storing goods. Yves Bouvier early developed an interest in art, and joined his father's company in the eighties.&lt;ref name=fr.worldtempus.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Le Coultre, le transport au sommet de son art depuis 150 ans|url=http://fr.worldtempus.com/article/culture/publiart-natural-coultre-transport-au-sommet-son-art-150-ans-326553|publisher=WorldTempus|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural Le Coultre==
Natural Transports was formed in 1859 as a moving and furniture storage company. It later became Natural Le Coultre &lt;ref name=fr.worldtempus.com /&gt; in 1901, when Albert-Maurice Natural joined Emile-Etienne Le Coultre to create A. Natural, Le Coultre &amp; Cie. In 1946, Jean-Jacques Bouvier began an apprenticeship at Natural Le Coultre S.A. In 1983, the Bouvier family acquired Natural Le Coultre. In 1989, Jean-Jacques and Yves Bouvier formed Fine Art Transports Natural Le Coultre SA in Geneva. Yves Bouvier became assistant manager in 1995 and then managing director in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.ge.ch/hrcintreport/createReport?rcentId=5750093500000066031025&amp;lang=FR&amp;order=R&amp;rad=Y |title=NATURAL LE COULTRE SA : inscrite le 24 janvier 1946 : Société anonyme |publisher=Rc.ge.ch |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; selling the moving and furniture storage activities to a local company to focus the company on storing, moving, and preserving pieces of art.&lt;ref name=bilan.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=Ce visionnaire qui a parié sur l’Asie|url=http://www.bilan.ch/entreprises-les-plus-de-la-redaction/ce-visionnaire-qui-parie-sur-lasie|publisher=TIFFY&amp;CO.|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Bouvier moved to [[Singapore]] in 2009 where he currently resides.

==Freeport facilities==
In 2005, Bouvier expanded his business model abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yves Bouvier: une ascension fulgurante dans le monde de l’art|url=http://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2015/02/26/yves-bouvier-une-ascension-fulgurante-monde-art|publisher=LE TEMPS SA|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by creating "artistic hubs" grouped into [[Free economic zone|freeport facilities]] that offer services and rental facilities to art collectors, museums and companies,&lt;ref name=bilan.ch /&gt; expanding into Singapore in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prystay|first1=Cris|title=Singapore Bling|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703691804575255551995870746|publisher=THE WALL STREET JOURNAL|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luxembourg in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blenkinsop|first1=Philip|title=Luxembourg opens art freeport to lure super-rich|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/17/art-luxembourg-idUSL6N0RI3CI20140917#BoWIRCJtp64ezHY3.97|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to open a [[Shanghai]] facility in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Le Coultre opens Shanghai artwork facility|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1741776/natural-le-coultre-opens-shanghai-artwork-facility|publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Rybolovlev case==

===Background===
For many years, Bouvier was known primarily as an art transporter. However, after 2010, he began to be associated with art sales, including some controversial cases involving alleged irregularities. First, in 2012 Bouvier was connected to a legal case involving a Canadian collector named Lorette Shefner. Shefner’s family claims that she was the victim of a complex fraud, whereby she was persuaded to sell a [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]] painting at a price far below market value, only to see the work later sold to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC for a much higher price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bouvier Shenanigans, Chapter Two: Steve Cohen|url = http://www.artsjournal.com/realcleararts/2015/03/bouvier-shenanigans-chapter-two-steve-cohen.html|website = Real Clear Arts|accessdate = 8 January 2016|language = en-US}} A 2013 law suit filed by the Shefner family in New York named Bouvier as a co-defendant with Paris-based Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière. Bouvier denies the claims against him, arguing that it is circumstantial and not based on any solid evidence. His lawyers have argued that there is no case to answer. The case remains pending.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cases.justia.com/new-york/other-courts/2013-ny-slip-op-32934-u.pdf?ts=1385072189 |title=Shefner v Jacques de la Beraudiere |website=Cases.justia.com |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate incident, de la Béraudière was linked to the high-profile criminal case of [[Wolfgang Beltracchi]], a German [[Art forgery|forger]] convicted in 2011 of defrauding a number of collectors, including [[Daniel Filipacchi]], of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The $7 Million Fake: Forgery Scandal Embarrasses International Art World|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-7-million-fake-forgery-scandal-embarrasses-international-art-world-a-768195-2.html|newspaper =[[Der Spiegel]] |publisher=Spiegel Online|date = 2011-06-13|accessdate = 8 January 2016|first = Sven|last = Röbel|first2 = Michael|last2 = Sontheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier’s purported connections to Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière and his ownership of an off-shore entity called Diva Fine Arts led to Bouvier being connected to the Beltracchi case. He has denied any connection to Beltracchi and dismissed media coverage as uninformed speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Steueroase: Freihäfen seien keine Schmuggler-Höhlen, beteuert Bouvier|url = http://www.zeit.de/2013/18/kunstmarkt-steueroase-yves-bouvier|website = ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and litigation===

On 26 February 2015, Yves Bouvier was arrested in [[Monaco]]. He was accused by Russian billionaire [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]] of defrauding him of hundreds of millions of dollars through the sale of 37 paintings over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Robert|title=Art scandal threatens to expose mass fraud in global art market|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/13/art-scandal-threatens-to-expose-mass-fraud-in-global-art-market.html|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulholland|first1=Rory|title=Monaco FC owner Rybolovlev among alleged victims of huge art scam|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/monaco/11436640/Swiss-businessman-Yves-Bouvier-arrested-for-art-fraud.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier denied all accusations, argues that he first heard about the complaint was when he was arrested, and that the price of the paintings had been agreed by both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Peter|title=Multi-millionaire businessman who stores cars, wine, cigars and art treasures for the rich and famous is arrested in fraud case|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2970732/Multi-millionaire-businessman-Yves-Bouvier-stores-treasures-rich-famous-arrested-fraud-case.html|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Forbes]], Rybolovlev spent New Year's Eve with Sandy Heller, art adviser to hedge fund billionaire [[Steven A. Cohen]]. Heller mentioned to Rybolovlev that Cohen had sold a [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] nude for $93.5&amp;nbsp;million to a "mystery buyer", alleging he didn’t know that the buyer was Bouvier. Rybolvlev had paid Bouvier $118&amp;nbsp;million. Rybolovlev filed for fraud and money laundering in Monaco nine days later, and persuaded Bouvier to meet him there to discuss payment details for a [[Mark Rothko]] painting, at which time he was arrested by eight policemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontevecchia|first1=Agustino|title=Steve Cohen's Modigliani In The Middle Of An Art Market War: Billionaire Rybolovlev vs Yves Bouvier|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2015/03/12/steve-cohens-modigliani-in-the-middle-of-an-art-market-war-billionaire-rybolovlev-vs-yves-bouvier/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Hugo|last2=Baker|first2=Stephanie|title=The Billionaire, the Dealer, and the $186 Million Rothko|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-27/a-186-million-rothko-pits-russian-tycoon-against-art-merchant|publisher=Bloomberg Business|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2015, Singapore's High Court ordered the global freezing of Bouvier’s assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore court orders asset freeze on 'Freeport King'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/13/us-singapore-court-idUSKBN0M90RH20150313|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then lifted this decision 12 days later, ordering Rybolovlev to give a total of $100m guarantee of damages from his action against Bouvier, $20m in cash and an $80m guarantee on the Rothko No. 6 painting.&lt;ref name=bloomberg.com /&gt; On 21 August 2015, the Singapore Court of Appeal removed the freezing injunction, on the ground that the procedure launched by Rybolovlev amounted to an abuse of procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perlson|first1=Hili|title=Singapore Court of Appeal Unfreezes Yves Bouvier's Assets|url=https://news.artnet.com/people/singapore-unfreezes-yves-bouviers-assets-327141|publisher=artnetnews|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the High Court of Singapore dismissed Bouvier's attempt to suspend the civil suit filed in the territory against him by two companies linked to the Rybolovlev family trust, but the case was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court, which deals specifically with cross-border commercial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/spore-court-to-hear-14b-art-suit|title=Singapore court to hear $1.4b art suit|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, in an effort to gain a friendlier hearing, Bouvier’s lawyers filed an appeal against the High Court's ruling. Bouvier prefers to have the case heard in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-31/art-world-s-1-billion-question-was-russian-a-victim-or-savant|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=Art’s $1 Billion Question: Was Russian a Victim or Savant? - Bloomberg|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2017, the Singapore Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's decision, ruling that the case should be heard in Switzerland and ordering the action in Singapore to be stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/apex-court-says-no-to-art-dispute-being-heard-here|title=Apex court says no to art dispute being heard here|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rybolovlev had successfully obtained an injunction from Hong Kong’s High Court in July 2015, on 4 September, Bouvier had his assets in Hong Kong unfrozen. High Court recorder Jason Pow Wing-nin SC ordered the injunction against art dealer Bouvier and his Hong Kong company Mei Invest Limited to be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1855225/swiss-art-dealer-accused-raking-us1b-secret-profits-sales|title=Swiss art dealer's Hong Kong assets unfrozen amid court battle with Russian tycoon who accused him of swindling|website=Scmp.com|date=4 September 2015|author=Julie Chu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregularities were found in Rybolovlev’s complaint against Bouvier: Rybolovlev, who had served eleven months in jail after his involvement in the murder of Evgeny Panteleymonov, was suspected of collusion with several senior Monegasque officials. Some believe he plotted against Bouvier with the help of Philippe Narmino, Minister of Justice, and Jean-Pierre Dreno, Prosecutor of Monaco.&lt;ref name=mediapart.fr&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duparc|first1=Agathe|title=Le milliardaire russe Rybolovlev compte de puissants relais monégasques|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/economie/290615/le-milliardaire-russe-rybolovlev-compte-de-puissants-relais-monegasques|publisher=MEDIAPART|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; French newspapers [[Mediapart]] and [[Libération]] suggested that during a dinner in [[Gstaad]], Rybolovlev, Narmino and Gérard Cohen may have discussed the details of the plot, only a few weeks before Bouvier was arrested.&lt;ref name=mediapart.fr /&gt; Additionally, [[HSBC]] has been accused of forgery and falsification of records that led to Bouvier's arrest in Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Letzing|first1=John|title=Russian Billionaire’s Battle With Art Dealer Draws In HSBC|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-billionaires-battle-with-art-dealer-draws-in-hsbc-1447971694|publisher=THE WALL STREET JOURNAL|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier's defense has objected to Rybolovlev's lawyer, Tetiana Bersheda, serving as Rybolovlev's translator during questioning while also being the subject of a deposition as a witness in the same case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yves Bouvier et sa complice precontre attaquent|url=https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2015/07/15/yves-bouvier-complice-presumee-contre-attaquent|publisher=LE TEMPS|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former friend of the Rybolovlev family, Tania Rappo, was also charged alongside Bouvier, in her case with money laundering in relation to the fraud. Rappo later alleged that Tetiana Bersheda, lawyer of Rybolovlev, registered at the bar of Geneva, recorded a private conversation without authorization in order to obtain information that might help secure an indictment. However, Bersheda maintains that the recording was of a professional conversation only and, as such, permitted by Monaco law. In any event, the Monaco Justice has yet to make any decision in relation to Rappo's complaint and the charges against Rappo, based partly on the content of the conversation, remain pending.&lt;ref name="tdg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/economie/tetiana-bersheda-c-nouvelle-manuvre/story/21809879|publisher=tdg.ch|title=Marché de l’art: Tetiana Bersheda: "C'est une nouvelle manœuvre" - Économie - tdg.ch|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2016, Bersheda was also charged by Monaco court for violation of the privacy of Rappo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monacolife.net/?action=show&amp;id=4974|title=Lawyer for ASM owner in court today|website=Monacolife.net|date=23 February 2016|author=Ian Brodie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitry Rybolovlev and his lawyer might be sentenced to up to 3 years of imprisonment.

On 14 September 2015, Bouvier was indicted on charges of concealed theft of two [[Picasso]]s belonging to Catherine Hutin-Blay, step-daughter of Picasso, who claims that they were stolen from her collection. However, Bouvier demonstrated she received the amount of 8&amp;nbsp;million euros through a Liechtensteiner trust for their sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellet|first1=Harry|title=L’homme d’affaires Yves Bouvier mis en examen pour recel de deux Picasso volés|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2015/09/15/l-homme-d-affaires-yves-bouvier-mis-en-examen-pour-recel-de-deux-picasso-voles_4757968_1655012.html|publisher=LeMonde.fr|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution of Liechtenstein closed the case on 1 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/economie/Vaduz-classe-une-plainte-pour-blanchiment-visant-Yves-Bouvier/story/29735335|title=Vaduz classe une plainte pour blanchiment visant Yves Bouvier|website=Tdg.ch|date=18 December 2015|author=Pierre-Alexandre Sallier|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Bouvier took legal action in [[New York (state)|New York]] against the consultant Sandy Heller, asking that he be questioned about his interactions with Rybolovlev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Letzing|first1=John|title=Russian Oligarch’s Legal Battle Entangles U.S. Art Consultant|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-oligarchs-legal-battle-over-painting-entangles-u-s-art-consultant-1443362544|publisher=THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier wants Heller to reveal the advice he may have provided to Rybolovlev that may have unfairly implicated him in the criminal cases he currently faces in France and Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/market/yves-bouvier-pushes-to-have-new-york-art-consultant-s-dealings-revealed-in-us-court/|title=Yves Bouvier pushes to have New York art consultant’s dealings revealed in US court|website=Theartnewspaper.com|language=en-GB|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major article about the Bouvier Affair published in [[the New Yorker]] in February 2016 alleged that Bouvier was using the profits from his dealings with Rybolovlev to fund his ambitious plans for the Singapore Freeport. The article quotes a colleague of Bouvier as saying, "...to build freeports you need to be a billionaire...Rybolovlev was the billionaire whose money was building the freeports." As to Bouvier's method of marking-up the price of the works he was selling, the article found that "When a deal with the seller was in sight, Bouvier would then agree on his own price with Rybolovlev, which was often tens of millions of dollars higher," and provided the example of the sale of Picasso's ''Joueur de Flûte et Femme Nue'', which Bouvier sold to Rybolovlev for twenty-five million euros after having bought it the day before for just three and a half million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/the-bouvier-affair|title=The Bouvier Affair|date=15 February 2016|author=Sam Knight|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2016, following the lead of European authorities, US Federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Bouvier, whom they described as "one of the art world’s consummate insiders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-09/the-da-vinci-markup-europe-s-art-scandal-comes-to-america|title=The Da Vinci Markup? Europe's Art Scandal Comes to America|last=hugodmiller|first=Keri Geiger GeigerWire Hugo Miller|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Bouvier entered a new phase of his campaign to clear his name by hiring global PR group, CNC Communications &amp; Network Consulting, part of French giant Publicis Groupe.&lt;ref name="odwyerpr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odwyerpr.com/story/public/6800/2016-04-28/dealer-bouvier-affair-gets-pr-help.html|publisher=odwyerpr.com|title=Dealer in 'Bouvier Affair' Gets PR Help - Thu., Apr. 28, 2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Sotheby's issued a pre-emptive suit in relation to the [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)]] painting, denying that it had ever been part of a scheme allegedly perpetrated by Bouvier to defraud both the sellers of the painting, and Rybolovlev.&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/sothebys-bouvier-rybolovlev-758348|publisher=news.artnet.com|title=Sotheby's Denies Helping Flip Bouvier's $127.5 Million Leonardo|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' subsequently published a major investigative report into the sale, asking whether the sellers of the Salvator Mundi "were misled [by Sotheby's] to favor the Swiss dealer, a valued Sotheby’s client named Yves Bouvier."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/arts/design/sothebys-tries-to-block-suit-over-a-leonardo-sold-and-resold-at-a-big-markup.html|publisher=nytimes.com|title=Sotheby’s Tries to Block Suit Over a Leonardo Sold and Resold at a Big Markup - The New York Times|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, it emerged in a report carried by Bloomberg that several of the works acquired by Yves Bouvier for the Rybolovlev family trust will likely be sold at substantial losses in auctions at Christie's.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-02-23/a-100-million-mystery-a-russian-his-art-and-his-big-losses|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=A $100 Million Mystery: A Russian, His Art, and His Big Losses - Bloomberg|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rybolovlev's spokesman said at the time: "The gulf between Christie’s estimates and the original purchase prices of the works is a further illustration of the unprecedented scale and audacity of the fraud that the plaintiffs allege was perpetrated by Mr. Bouvier."

In September 2017 it was reported that Swiss inland revenue blocked assets of Bouvier, as he is believed to owe CHF 165 Million in taxes [https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/bundesstrafgericht-genfer-kunsthaendler-soll-165-millionen-franken-an-steuern-schulden-id7257042.html]

==Other contributions==
In 2004 Bouvier founded the company Art Culture Studio that organizes cultural events, restores furniture, and provides support to the Renaissance Foundation for Russian Country Homes, a non-profit organization that supports research on the restoration of cultural and historic buildings in rural areas.. He initiated and chaired the [[Moscow]] World Fine Art and the [[Salzburg]] World Fine Art Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salzburg World Fine Art Fair To Open July 27|url=http://artdaily.com/news/21038/Salzburg-World-Fine-Art-Fair-To-Open-July-27#.VlJOGlUvfnB|publisher=artdaily|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Bouvier initiated the creation of the Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris, an expansion of  [[Pinacothèque de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Changy|first1=Florence|title=Singapour a désormais sa Pinacothèque de Paris|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2015/06/04/singapour-a-desormais-sa-pinacotheque-de-paris_4647357_1655012.html|publisher=LeMonde.fr|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, "The museum in Singapore mirrors that of France, a fine art museum known for its critically acclaimed exhibitions that celebrate transversality and the dialogue between different works of art".

Bouvier was involved with the "pôle R4" project, an artistic "micro-city" on the site of a former Renault factory in [[Seguin Island]], Paris. The project, designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], was until September 2016 managed and financed by Bouvier, and was scheduled to open in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lankarani|first1=Nazanin|title=A New Concept in Handling Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/arts/10iht-rcartoff.html?_r=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016 it was announced that Bouvier had sold his entire stake to the Emerige Group and its financial partner, Addax and Oryx Group Limited (AOG).&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/paris-r4-new-financial-backer-648308|publisher=news.artnet.com|title=Paris' R4 Finds New Financial Backer – artnet News|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="24heures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24heures.ch/economie/yves-bouvier-abandonne-projet-parisien-r4/story/10362656|publisher=24heures.ch|title=Transaction: Yves Bouvier abandonne le projet parisien R4 - Économie - 24heures.ch|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artnet noted that the transaction frees the project from its association from Bouvier.&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"/&gt;
